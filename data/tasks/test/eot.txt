agent:have you ever lived in that part of the country|user:i thought the story was pretty good too i th[ink]- i think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it|user:and uh	no i haven't	1
agent:it was the thing is it was a it was a good story|user:uh-huh|agent:well the interesting thing was is i had heard that and i- i- i tend to i think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great and and	right	1
agent:do you do you listen to Gary Cohill|user:um [noise] the other one Silence of the Lambs is kind of a a gory movie if if somebody's not into that kind of stuff it's it's pretty graphic at points but uh i think they're both excellent movies|user:it's suspenseful i don't think it's very t[error]- i mean there's not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that it's it's more suspense	no huh-uh	1
agent:do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon driver|user:greater than any awards that they can give him|user:i think that i think he did a good job and and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much	um	1
user:[noise]	well the first thing for me is i wonder i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is um if privacy is something that disturbs your private state i mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state	0
agent:so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that i realized no i i really wanted this and it was sort of exciting and so that was|user:[laughter-that's] [laughter-right]|agent:typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang and it's TI calling my immediate reaction is th[at]- -[i]t's some sort of strange phone message and then i realize oh no this is something i solicited	uh-huh	1
agent:and and uh that that then ends up being the the most common example for me|user:um-hum um-hum|agent:because uh some sense of of the way the ritual is played out	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:that i would rather they didn't and that might be the sense of a spending pattern for instance that that i would have thought to be private|agent:not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from me|agent:and then i would feel	um-hum um-hum	1
user:for it i mean you know you can't tell what what a company really has to do with it and there's something rather ominous about having|agent:right|user:you know full cash price	virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are and you know and	1
user:whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and act like the lunatic you you violate the uh the norms of socia[l]- of um public behavior|agent:uh-huh|user:and people would leave me alone	um people start paying attention to you very much and they start asking questions and in a sense are invite invade invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are you know quote unquote you asked for it	0
agent:yes|user:there's this invisible barrier around me which people will re[spect]- will respect|user:because_1 anyone can be alone for oh some period of time but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that	and if that's gone um i i r[eally]- really don't know how to live very well	1
agent:i'm in Lewisville|user:where are you|agent:pardon me	Lewisville okay i'm in Garland	0
agent:yeah i know that's that's only part of the problem|user:but just because we've got a lot of money doesn't mean that's gonna solve the problem|user:that's right	[noise] i mean i think there's a lot of waste in	0
agent:i really couldn't go into teaching because_1 it was not economically feasible for me to do so|agent:for my degree and uh i got a lot of good out of that and i liked teaching but|agent:uh	yeah what do you do	1
agent:[vocalized-noise]|agent:that|user:so what about your income tax	think they're hitting you too hard	1
agent:how's that|user:i'm glad i don't work in a store|agent:hum-um	because_1 i wouldn't want to have to figure this seven point something percent i guess they've got a little table though and it's all written out	1
agent:and you know they're not making that much money they're making probably more like five or six on the welfare so where's the other ninety percent going well it's going to the some fat guy in the middle who's sitting there on his behind all day doing nothing but filling out papers|agent:every welfare recipient would be making like forty five thousand dollars a year|agent:directly to the people	par[t]-	1
agent:yeah right|user:you know it's just you see garbage pans i mean pails just filled and we pay people to haul them off right|agent:wow	[laughter] and the like a guy does it and he has his own pigs	1

agent:yeah|user:they were getting a good deal|user:my parents always lived in houses that he built and then they knew	so	1
agent:yeah|user:i guess the work force would be the main wouldn't it|user:oh	it	0

user:uh-huh|user:[vocalized-noise] where as|agent:[laughter] My dad was stationed in Guam during the World War Two though	yeah where as Puerto Rico is pretty close by	1
user:i don't know if that's uh|agent:[laughter]|agent:[vocalized-noise]	if that's true about all Puerto Ricans or not	1
user:but uh|agent:oh okay|user:yeah this is this is actually the first time i've i've had someone call me so [noise]	it went fine	1
user:uh r[ealistically]- realistically|agent:do you do you think that that we should have given up the Panama Canal|user:and i did live in uh Sao Paulo Brazil for four years	i	1
user:certainly uh|user:expert on the on the region but uh|user:i i have a a little bit i can't say that i'm i i would be an	i	1
user:uh Sandinistas had|user:what seem what seems to be popular support|user:under	to a given extent popular support	0
user:of the world which is not only|user:inf[luence]- Soviet influence in in what's considered to be the United States' fear|user:not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about the	you we used to see spheres but now we're in a situation where the United States is	0
user:uh|user:and on to their detriment they came from uh this|user:i[f]- y[ou]- p[retty]- if you look at the region and	hundreds of years of Spanish control in the in the Spaniards	0
agent:have uh have a pretty good reputation of exploiting you know we basically the Panama Canal we went in and and took it|agent:it it's it is interesting that that you know we we look at the exploitation and and and then we accuse some other people of exploiting and and and Americans|user:like trivial and uh you get	oh absolutely and n[ow]- we set up	1
agent:it's like the street people that are starting to show up all over the US is that|agent:can you can a can a democracy uh afford the|agent:and i wouldn't don't know that i would advocate communism but uh the question is can a	right	1
user:right|agent:to uh where he's got something to protect other you know whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest to him|agent:if he's got uh you know i[f]- if he if he can raise enough uh coffee and bananas	right	1
agent:particularly if you're hungry|user:because_1 yeah yeah yeah y[ou]- it's not j[ust]- it's not just a matter of uh|user:for those	of having an	0
agent:uh-huh|user:public television|user:as a matter of fact i prefer	and uh	1
user:well unfortunately|agent:of regular TV|agent:the sitcoms	for	0
agent:did you stay up late and catch this Red Dwarf [laughter] oh that was a scream|user:but uh|agent:me too	no uh	0
agent:[laughter] [laughter]|user:no no that's true i was just thinking that today he well|agent:oh he could never cut it [laughter]	in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate	0
agent:what's that about|agent:uh|user:Yes Minister	that was about a	0
agent:yeah|user:two or three novels a week|user:i read about	in addition to all the technical stuff what d[o]- what	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:[laughter] yeah|user:how did i hear about it well i work you know they're gathering a database for voice processing	and	0
user:i think|user:uh|agent:uh-huh	what they're trying to say is that there is a great deal of	1
agent:yeah|user:uh particularly since most of the tr[anslations]- most of the translations were from Greek|user:that so much was lost in the translation	uh well for example	1
agent:huh|user:to deny that at least you know the majority of it|user:uh the histories that are that were developed around that time that are available	is true so you know you know it depends on how you look at it	1
agent:[laughter-yeah] that's right [laughter]|user:as as far as that goes i a[t]- we at we at least agree on you know on what we enjoy in that regard|user:but uh i	but uh	1
user:i don't have su[ch]- such close experience with with um|user:well i'm i guess|agent:what is your situation	an area becoming a state as you do	0
user:you know i saw it|user:and so um|agent:oh that's very interesting	also as a young student and and it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in California and so the Spanish was no problem	0
user:um|user:well probably more on in terms of the US|agent:economies was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on on Puerto Rico or pressures on the US in terms of aid or	you know i'm i'm not quite sure how the US copes	0
agent:we're assuming that that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than than say Mississippi or|agent:um|agent:i guess	i think so	1
user:ways of life than they would if if|user:um|user:probably freer to determine their own	i-	0
user:to declare this before they become a state|user:it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want|user:so if they've just taken such action	or maybe because they don't want to become a state	0
user:um-hum um-hum|agent:i'm troubled even in by bilingualism uh in so far as that it intr[udes]- it gets in the way of of of the melting pot aspect|agent:um	that's interesting because	0
user:right|agent:but i'm rather in favor of people being bilingual and i'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language|agent:yeah	right	1
agent:and um [noise] the the how i met him was through uh the aerobics class that he used to teach|user:um-hum|agent:for a kinesiology program there	um-hum you're a student	0
user:but i do lots of outdoor sports and things|agent:um-hum|user:like um i've never done aerobics or any sort of structured this is my exercise time	bicycling uh	1
user:um-hum|agent:you know a a calc[ulated]- you know calculated down and and do your calisthenics you know three times a week or|user:um-hum um-hum	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:it was quite a lot of fun|user:um-hum|user:um-hum um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:um-hum|user:and before that there was the running craze and they California gets you know tends to be a bit faddish but|user:you know for all i know aerobics started out here i don't know where they actually started but they you know the craze really picked up big here	the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere	0
user:on|user:and it doesn't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything it it's|agent:um-hum	fairly s[olid]- solid scientific ground uh it's just dispensed with these distinctions it says ev[ery]- all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they they combined them all together	0
user:um had an impact on the society around here and one of the ones that had an impact was|user:yeah yeah exactly and part of it is California you know in back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements and some of them fizzled out and some of them were disastrous and others of them|user:and s[ome]-	um people becoming interested in alternate	0
agent:or they're older well don't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar[ea]- i- i- i sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city i live in a rural area so you know i see the|agent:yeah|user:doing the exercises and i guess because they spend all day in back of their desks the average person out on the farm at least traditionally now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally the laborers last thing pardon me	oh like everything else	1
agent:yeah|user:they don't have that perfect look and an awful lot of exercises is sort of image conscious but they you know they live to a hundred and ten some day [laughter-you] [laughter-know]|user:they seem pretty you know they don't have the hard body	and that that's	1
user:it occurred to me|agent:well of course in the cities yeah well in the cities we live close to Dallas so|user:i was wondering that because i was actually applying for a job in Texas and and and uh	um-hum	1
user:uh usually we have at least one|user:uh [vocalized-noise] we've had a lot more warm weather than usual and we haven't had any ice storms|user:i guess we're um uh we're we're experiencing uh what to me i guess is a surprisingly mild uh winter	um course i've only lived here three years but uh but that i[n]- still in that three years you could always count on at least one ice storm	1
agent:off and on since seventy four so really quite a while|agent:and uh pretty much|user:uh-huh	wow yeah	1
user:and uh and then soon after we had this big ice storm|user:[noise] and we got here and we just couldn't believe how warm it was i mean it was in the fifties and we were taking off our winter coats and we were all dressed like Eskimos|agent:um-hum	uh where everything was just covered with like an inch of ice and everybody uh and it was obvious that nobody knew how to drive in this weather	0
user:you know and uh certainly nothing that you have to do anything about|agent:okay|user:if you get any snow it's barely enough to hide the brown grass	um	1
user:right|agent:but it's not six feet of snow and it doesn't stay on the ground six months out of the year and i know the sun is coming [laughter]|user:yeah	[laughter] well that's the thing uh with us too it's uh j[ust]- we just	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:oh goodness|user:there could be yeah there could be a[nd]- and it came i mean i used to i used to work in Boston which was an hour and a half away	and i would get up at five o'clock in the morning just to shovel out driveway	0
agent:uh that we would be up here trying to call and it we'd figure out after about the first hour that there ain't nobody at work [laughter]|user:yes uh-huh|agent:well now do you work at TI i was gonna say there've been several times when i know they had ice storms down in Dallas	yeah	1
agent:but uh|user:yeah|agent:of a winter up there i could truly love	oh i can remember uh walking around you know taking a lunch break	0
user:oh|agent:you know if there's a breeze blowing it's a nice comfortable day and you don't feel like you have to take ten showers a day because you you take a shower and walk outside and the humidity's so great you know you're sweating to death again|user:okay	[laughter]	1
agent:[laughter]|user:a computer with training wheels|user:uh we've gotten a little Atari computer uh husband describes it as a	uh	1
agent:do you have your own kiln or do you do you|agent:huh|user:when you first start off and then it goes to bisque and that's when you can paint it	no i've uh	1
agent:um-hum|user:i'm a little shaky when it comes to detail work|user:no i liked it i had fun with it but uh you know uh	so i couldn't get the fine pieces so you know i had to	1
agent:occasionally i'll record one of the shows that's on in the morning while i'm at work and i'll do them_1 when i get home|user:i workout with them or try to|agent:uh-huh	yeah well i don't work	1
agent:yeah i i enjoy volleyball i'm just not very good at it and i end up j[ust]-|agent:hm|user:it's fun	[laughter]	1
agent:[noise]|agent:uh-huh|agent:[noise]	you know it's	0
agent:so|agent:and i've been at it awhile|agent:a Computer Information Systems degree from school	yeah	1
user:right|agent:yes bu[t]- it wasn't quite business but to give the the students um an made you feel like you were the authority i felt like if i came in just in jeans or|user:somewhat business attire yeah	[laughter]	1
user:is big on business attire and so um|user:and uh the senior vice president is uh|agent:um-hum	um he sort of funnels that down to uh	0
agent:their equal|agent:i had to do something to just elevate myself a little bit off their level i mean you want to be friends with the students but you don't quite want to be|agent:and um so i	exactly	1
agent:totally different wardrobe with different fabrics you know heavier wools and|agent:where you have to|user:i'm i'm sure that's true yeah	right	1
agent:you know if you wear um pastels it's needs to be warm weather [laughter] and otherwise you have to wear darker colors in the winter for some reason and|user:true|agent:the color certain colors seem to be more acceptable	right	1
agent:holidays too that's pretty funny it's funny that we have as a society|agent:two|user:exactly exactly	[laughter]	1
agent:um-hum|user:because_1 i noticed that uh like even going to church uh seems like people really dress up a lot more uh here in North Dallas going to church|user:and uh	and uh	0
agent:right|user:all right um i think the topic was crime in the city	i do not live in a city i live in a real small little place	1
user:oh yeah|agent:the Iraqis didn't have a lot of high-tech weaponry but they had mortars and machine guns tanks and all that|agent:you know i mean	sure	1
agent:as we know it today|agent:crime|agent:to eliminate	um-hum	1
agent:hey people make mistakes|user:in other words if you get if you do something the first time that's not real bad you know|agent:you know	yeah to go ahead and let them_1 go but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then uh	1
agent:Turkey has death penalty for just about everything|agent:well you look at places like Turkey|user:yeah	um-hum	1
agent:and when they run out of money they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money and then they go back to work on Monday|agent:and they work all day and they go home and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs|agent:i mean their so high they could fly up to the top of that building	um-hum	1
user:if they see violence at home that's what you're going to|user:and i it really is i'm like you astonishing what the younger ages know and they react to what they see at home You know|user:you know that's huh-uh but something i do	get from the kids at	0
agent:you know transcribing stuff into the computer|agent:as a typist|agent:uh you look at uh Frito Lay my wife used to work for Frito Lay	uh-huh	1
user:um-hum|agent:and once uh once you get started on it it's just oh i just l[ove]- i love it [vocalized-noise] i do a lot of my own patterns also|agent:oh its not	yeah	1
agent:it can add up quick|agent:it uh yeah|agent:is uh	oh yeah	1
agent:but the colors are i just love all the different colors|user:um-hum|agent:there's lots of shades of greens	yeah	1

agent:on that uh|agent:[laughter]|user:i think the other one's gonna the child is gonna be in high school before i get [laughter-finished]	embarrassing	1
agent:[laughter] that was a good coincidence|user:didn't [laughter]|user:sh[e]- i gave it to her and she said how did you know those are the colors we used i said	just worked out that way	1
agent:well i've enjoyed this|user:um true|agent:oh yeah	okay	1

agent:yep yep|agent:uh-huh|user:are you serious	do are you someone that likes the heat	1
agent:but|agent:but we haven't had one you know in a long time|agent:we get ice storms here	so what's the lowest that the temperature would ever get there	1
user:people were [noise] faced with|user:um they finally opened up again i- i don't want to even say as normal because nothing was really normal this week|agent:uh-huh	trees	0
user:they were all torn down um|user:and they're all just destroyed|agent:uh-huh	the ice i[t]- it was really just a crippling	0
agent:uh-huh|user:well i grew up in Boston and in Boston um we get our share of snow|agent:accurate	but it was always very very well cleaned up	0
agent:so|user:um-hum|user:oh my gosh	that's crazy	1
agent:you don't even have power back to your house yet|user:you just feel like you're imposing on people|agent:uh-huh	you know	1
agent:ruined|user:you can't use it it's it's just gone bad|agent:destroyed	so this storm really i[t's]- uh it's been incredible	1
agent:it's beautiful here|user:um-hum|user:sun	well throughout all of this i called my in-laws who live in Florida	1
agent:but going through it's so much different yeah|user:you know you can hear about it on TV and you just think so|user:and	yeah exactly and you just never think it could happen to you	1
user:but there are some people that just love it i mean there are people that even if it gets to|user:no it's true|agent:you could never get use to that kind of weather	sixty degrees they feel that's too hot	0
agent:uh yeah as a matter of fact i went to uh one of the nurseries and uh bought myself another cactus plant [noise] i've got many uh shrubs inside the house|user:hi today is uh Saturday have you found spare time to do any hobbies|agent:hello	is that right	1
agent:[noise] yeah they didn't uh survive the freeze|user:from the winter|agent:yeah i['m]- i'm assessing the damage outside right now i've got couple of a few shrubs i need to replace outside	yeah	1
user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:a lot of evergreens|user:we just	it gets so hot	0
user:no sewing or knitting any of that|user:no|user:cross stitch um	um	0
agent:i'm not uh much of a a woodworker myself but my dad owns a shop and he uh makes quite a few uh arts and crafts jus[t]- type things out of wood|agent:[noise] well um|user:well i don't uh have too much else i do in my spare time how about_1 you	i[s]- that right	0
agent:and uh he's been doing a lot of uh lot of decorative type plates lately|agent:different types of vases uh ones that stand on the floor and others that you can put on tables|agent:uh lots of uh	um-hum	1
agent:all right|user:gardening there|user:good luck with your indoor	i'll talk to you later	0
user:and uh you know it was a desperate thing|user:i took my son to a day care one time when he was j[ust]- [vocalized-noise] you know just uh not even three months old|agent:uh-huh	and uh	0
agent:yeah|user:she had treated him like family does|user:and that was you know he she'd just	you know and um	1
user:uh|agent:um-hum|user:uh [vocalized-noise] i don't know much about day cares itself you know	you know this is more of just the nursery for three and under	1
user:met a military man who lived down here and we came down here for TI|agent:uh-huh|user:uh because_1 you know my sister was keeping them_1 uh uh we just lucked out and she uh	and uh so i had her baby sitting but she was six months pregnant and it was getting too much for her	0
user:they|user:yeah well|agent:yeah i th[ink]- i think that's that's important	i think it's one of the important things	1
agent:right|agent:uh-huh|user:i don't like the punishment the day care does you know i don't know exactly what they do but i don't want no one punishing my kids but myself	and that's another problem with day care because you're not there so you don't what they're doing	1
user:oh|agent:and welcome to Texas|user:[laughter] yeah so have i	oh well thanks and i guess i w[e've]- we've been on long enough	1
user:it's a real challenge not to become like what they call a junk food junkie where your menu is composed of|user:and|user:and it's a real challenge to find foods proper foods to eat	uh	0
user:uh say steak or something you know that i- i do admit that i|user:but i do sometimes when i smell meat you know when i smell particularly|agent:um-hum	you know s[till]- wish you know that i could have that [laughter-flavor] but	0
agent:do you eat cheese do you eat li[ke]- eggs an|agent:yes but that's|user:you would have animal products it would have cheese but you know not meat	yeah we do eat	0
agent:but it's becoming more that way i think it's probably easier now to find things|user:but um|user:so although you can i mean there's cookbooks and there's ways to do it it's a lot more expensive too i think you know the the the market is just not made for a vegan so	yeah it if well	0
user:um|user:so|user:horrible but there's a lot of things you can buy that have soybean products in them to begin with that you don't even know where in there	it's it's just a matter of	0
agent:yeah|user:you know they they have the turkey you know they do they ca[n't]- they you can't stop you know everyone's [laughter-life]|agent:[laughter]	but um	0
user:so|user:yeah|agent:even the turkey yeah that's true	um	1
user:is um|user:pretty famous restaurant out of New York and almost every single recipe in there|user:uh it's out of New York it's a	vegetarian there are some fish recipes i think in it but a few of those but not anything	0
user:and different animal products you know are causing uh can cause uh different kinds of diseases|user:that meats|user:you know and and when you read so much information that tells you	you know [vocalized-noise] like h[eart]- heart diseases and different diabetes and things like that different kinds of diseases it's like uh	0
user:yeah i- i would say you know th[e]- almost everyone and uh|user:i think you'd feel probably a lot healthier um [vocalized-noise] my a[lmost]- almost everyone in my family is is obese|agent:and i'm terribly overweight i'm obese probably is the word i've never used that word on myself before but i am very large and probably if i could give up the meat products and just get on vegetables i would probably look a lot better	exc[ept]-	0
user:Saddam Hussein only allowed CNN to|user:well why was CNN the on[ly]- of course i think|user:uh-huh	broadcast it is that not true	1
user:and they were saying that CNN is definitely a world|agent:[vocalized-noise] um-hum|user:well i listen to a Christian radio station	uh news	0
user:terrible riot supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem|user:and i was watching on TV they they broadcast this|agent:um-hum	so we got all fearful for our people come to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of it	1
agent:you know from anyone else's point of view but they'd get all blown up in the news|agent:from my point of view and it seemed|user:yeah	uh-huh	1
agent:huh|user:an interest in|user:huh-uh i have find it hard to uh follow from one page to another it's just something i've never developed uh	and i live in kind of a bad area where if i have the paper delivered	0
agent:no i don't i work for North Carolina State University|user:you work for TI|user:huh	huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:so if we've done our three minutes|user:minutes	let's just let the conversation end and say bye [laughter]	1
agent:yeah shoot man it's what midnight almost|agent:yeah twenty one|user:on the other coast [laughter]	what yeah yeah it's uh i'm watching Saturday Night Live here	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah so it it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway kind of quaint little towns but they don't have a whole lot there|user:like Chapel Hill	where are you at	1
agent:and uh you know unless the Navy funds it i probably won't do it until i if i do do it it will be after i get out of the Navy|user:yeah|agent:probably not see i'm in the Navy	when do you get out	1
agent:um-hum|user:h[e]- uh he works over in Maryland|user:and um	and so he's doing his Master's here they gave him like a scholarship like for a year	0
user:yeah|agent:yeah those are few and far between though [laughter]|user:but that's uh	it's uh it's like uh in IBM in IBM you can get certain points	0
agent:um-hum|agent:[noise]|user:yeah i mean it's like it's like the people that actually do the work there	are uh very few and then the other people just plan it	0
agent:uh-huh|user:suppose you know like you're a manager so they'll put you into|user:but they won't let you off what they'll do is like	keeping up	0
agent:yeah they are out of Korea right|user:and and you know it's like for example like Leading Edge have you ever heard of Leading Edge|agent:yeah well you know that's that's a that's a big thing	what	1
agent:um-hum|user:when when you realize [vocalized-noise] tea[chers]- one of my teachers got this computer and which you know it's like um voice uh synthesis and stuff [noise]|user:[vocalized-noise] well i mean there's like	and he got that he said you know it's like um	0
user:yeah|agent:well when you get yeah when you get right down to it the uh the more they can do for you the more uh like i say the more the more memory they're gonna require|user:imagine imagine what it is for us to make Markov models you know it's like [laughter] Jesus Christ	yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:and i started thinking that over the years that importance has changed and i suspect that that's probably true for everyone|agent:uh-huh	when i was	0
user:and that's certainly one of the reasons that i'm sure that they've|agent:yeah|user:one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves	begun the	1
agent:it's not gonna be build up quite enough yeah|user:so it's not uh all by itself it won't be adequate for for my situation|agent:uh-huh	so i have to find a way to supplement that	1
user:shown a history|user:uh it's|agent:yeah	that uh sure beats anything else	1
agent:that's right that's right [laughter]|user:little brother's only two years behind and he says well i don't know i think that i probably want to be a veterinarian and i said that's great let me explain to you how you get [laughter-scholarships] to do that|user:and then her	[laughter]	1
user:personally stand seeing them go to a|user:well i could certainly|agent:so that is kind of an idea that that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in and TI said that they were looking into something like that so	a standardized	0
user:but it should be a standard and and not left up to|agent:yeah|agent:yeah	either the whim or the current overhead rate th[at's]-	0
agent:um you know different things is it restricted to certain crimes or just [noise]|user:yes|agent:oh that's right i think now that i recall reading about it in the paper	yes it's certain crimes uh capital crimes murder of course uh	0
agent:than um expecting|agent:somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than|agent:i don't know i just think um	yes	1
agent:um-hum|agent:[noise]|user:[noise] not with me personally it is with a lot of people	it's not not to me personally no	0
agent:um-hum|user:i was reading something about it the o[ther]- day i i wanna [vocalized-noise] think there's only like six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still|user:they're only	a lot of them_1 had to have	0
user:[noise] right the first appeal is automatic so|agent:if it finally gets to that point|user:yes	that delays it for a few years just right off the bat	1
user:you know yes or no i would say you know yes i- i would have to|user:it's a it's a tough question it really is i guess if i had to say|agent:hum	lean toward capital punishment you know for certain crimes	1
agent:cut down on that|agent:you're hoping there is something that will|user:absolutely	yes i wish i had the answer for that everybody does	1
agent:but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone|user:yeah|agent:so maybe you would	so would i- i fortunately never been in that circumstance i hope i never am like like everybody else	1
agent:guess it's important that we decide as a people what what we're going to do|agent:i guess um|agent:i'd hate to decide it but	right	1
agent:oh really uh|user:everybody had what they called there social year|agent:um-hum	that they that they had to put in and basically it was a uh repayment for	0
agent:yeah i was too i thought seriously about joining at that time i thought it was a fantastic idea|user:i don't i don't know how the Peace Corps works i guess i was of age when the Peace Corps came [laughter-in] and all that|agent:i didn't know	did you ever get any information on it like	1
user:the price of freedom i guess is a little|agent:yeah|user:yeah [noise] well i guess that's uh	anyway the uh	0
agent:the people that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation you know like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that|user:you know if you start|user:[noise] and uh but if	yeah	1
agent:i don't know|user:yeah|user:um-hum	[noise]	0

agent:[noise] yeah i agree with that|user:if you offer of yourself you feel differently afterwards i think about the fact that you've put yourself into a country as opposed to expect everything to be given to you|user:that people feel that they commit themselves to a country or to that they've	interesting	1
user:kind of gotten out of the it i've got kids now that are|agent:yeah|user:really got into it hot and heavy and [vocalized-noise] about like you say i guess the last couple of years i've	are old enough to play summer baseball and fall league basketball and that kind of stuff and uh man i just don't have the time to go like i want to	1

user:[laughter]|agent:i guess i couldn't imagine that it [vocalized-noise] anything like that until i started reading about it and you know and i thought you know that sounds like okay [laughter-but] i never would have thought of doing it so|agent:yeah huh	yeah [vocalized-noise]	0
agent:maybe some slippers or something like that|user:uh-huh|agent:like Christmas stockings you could make the like the granny squares or whatever and sew them together and make Christmas stockings and	oh i see	1
user:my schedule is like from nine to five thirty but i could be at work from anytime you know from nine -[un]til|agent:yeah|user:uh no not much um my day is usually pretty full	nine at night or ten or whatever so it's hard to make plans much less you know have a hobby	1
agent:it just takes a long time to get it done but you know once you've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good to to see it|user:oh|agent:like stockings for both my children and a Christmas tree skirt and that type of thing and	right	0

agent:that's uh been surpassed by anything else than uh that because most women seem to be taking into careers and working now and changing the way the family situation is because they're now working and we have to have people to babysit and such|agent:now i think overall there's been a change i don't think um|agent:well i think the biggest change in like the last fifty years has been the increased number of women who work	uh-huh	1
user:you know for paying jobs so it seems that women are becoming more prominent in society|user:they're working|user:in the house	you know it seems that they're doing more work i think the work is the same it's just that they're getting	0
agent:and then she got to be kind of in the house when that wasn't needed as much and now she's kind of like back out of the house but not working for the family business working you know somewhere else|user:exactly just as important|agent:uh have as much to do with the whole livelihood of the family if you were in a farm situation it's kind of kind of kind of gone all the way around that way in the beginning you know their work input for a farm and even like putting in the crops and harvesting and such was as important as the man's you know needed both	yeah i think that's the that's also has a lot to do with uh today's society you know	0
user:nowadays that you know there's there's really no difference is is you know the the law the law says there's no difference so more women are are taking that opportunity|user:you know it's it's integration of it doesn't matter if your a man or a woman that makes it all you know everything makes everybody look equal for a job so it doesn't matter|user:that's the that's the important thing so it doesn't	to be in those spots	1
agent:why|user:it's it no it's just these these things you know these these uh|agent:why	values that that you're brought up with	1
EMPTY	[noise]	0

agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:see like i i don't give a lot of gifts during Christmas and i you know i don't wa[nt]- i don't like to give any at all because the thing is is that you know it's like if i want something i'll i'll ask somebody you know like like m[y]- uh for Ch[ristmas]- for Christmas you know my roommate goes what do you want	and i said i want a backpack	0
user:yeah|agent:Christmas time it's the end of the semester you've got finals and you've got lots of bills i would suspect|user:yeah	yeah	1

agent:well when i have time i do like to sew um i had been doing a lot of crocheting i make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them|user:uh what are some of your things you like to do|user:i guess i get s[ome]- some of both	yeah	1
agent:and [vocalized-noise] my husband says i do it you know make afghans so i can keep my lap warm|user:yeah|agent:i usually start in the fall	well that's kind of what my wife says she enjoys doing it during the cold weather because_1 she's always got something to cover her l[egs]- her legs and feet with while she's working on it	1
user:well i'm not sure what she does i i first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because_1 she starts|agent:Mile a Minute|user:mile a minute	and goes all the way across you know back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of of afghan	0
agent:yeah well it gets a little aggravating i've got kids all over the United States and and you know sometimes they get disconnected when i'm talking to them|user:that's one way to end a conversation|user:well i guess that	yeah	0
agent:besides they're fun to grow|user:i planted uh zucchini last year|user:um	uh i planted four hills of them_1 i think i had three or four s[eeds]- seeds in each one of them_1	0

user:um against a power company|user:um Colorado|user:i- i don't know if you h[eard]- uh heard about the uh recent legislation in	uh that's actually on Indian land i believe but um it has uh been ruled against uh regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing	0
user:um on an individual basis there isn't a lot that we can do about a lot of things but if we|agent:what do you think we can do|user:um-hum you think it's more we[ll]- more in society well i guess i kind of agree there i	are concerned about it then we certainly can uh	0
user:as a society i think we can do more and that's probably how we ought to do it|user:but um|user:um so i suspect that that's one thing that that as individuals we can do make our voices known perhaps to our legislators	uh individ[ually]- being individually responsible	1
agent:uh i probably wouldn't mind if it really came down it wou[ld]- [vocalized-noise]|user:right|agent:i don't think	[laughter-yeah]	1
agent:no i've only been here a couple of years|user:[noise] all right have you lived in this area long	okay	1

agent:um-hum um-hum|user:uh i have been drug tested in the past and it's not really a pleasant experience at work|agent:right right	and uh it gives you the uh im[pression]- [vocalized-noise] the uh impression that the company really doesn't trust the people that work for them_1	0
agent:right|user:and uh that gets put in your permanent uh files on your record|agent:um-hum	it's just not not a real good uh thing to have on your uh	0
agent:over a five year period|agent:so that's that's how they said they would uh do it|user:okay	well i'm not sure exactly if that's true though because i know people that have been tested more than one time	0
agent:especially i felt like there was a camera watching [laughter]|user:right|agent:yeah but yeah you're right that wasn't a very pleasant experience	oh no [laughter] i never thought about that i-	0
agent:yeah|agent:right|user:and in fact i know some people that uh probably will quit before being tested even though there's nothing to uh to worry about as far as i know	from the test results	0
user:yeah|agent:so that's that's what i thought was interesting that uh there are still drugs out there and then there are those socially acceptable drugs you know|agent:now	right	0
agent:um [noise] yeah because they're not as reliable as the government wants them to be|agent:and i understand that the government will not use that particular drug testing agency that that TI is using|user:sure	is that right	1
user:uh|user:well|user:okay	hum	1
agent:but uh oh i watch things like uh Sixty Minutes every week uh|user:no|user:[noise]	uh-huh	1

EMPTY	did they say anything	1
agent:and i had to go through you know a physical and everything and before they even told you you were hired like they just called me in for an interview and i went in for my interview and then right there he said okay go down to the company hospital and you'll go through a physical so you know i mean it was really good that way because they they tested everyone right away and you didn't you didn't have any notice you know so like if you were doing drugs then like you didn't have a way you know to stop i mean it was still in your body|user:uh-huh|user:[noise]	[noise]	1

user:demonstrated with this war especially compared with uh|user:i guess has been dramatically|user:the roles now between the sexes	the Vietnam war	0
user:now to me that's kind of a drawback|user:either parent|user:uh and the children are left without	but uh i guess it's a price you pay	1
user:uh they term it as more|user:uh more rebellious|user:uh these children are	uh	1
agent:uh let's see i guess basically starting junior high and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force|agent:in|agent:the older of two was	uh-huh	1
agent:a professional mother a person|user:a nanny sort of|user:that's strange	uh-huh uh-huh	1
user:[noise] uh-huh|agent:or to put their child into a s[etting]- into a home setting where they would you know like they they would get leave at eight in the morning and and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids and and you were paying for really high quality care|user:to come in and live with them_1	yeah	1
user:a single|user:uh well no i just know i know several single mothers who absolutely can't afford it they have to go with the|agent:i haven't ever really looked at them are you aware at all of of what they would what they cost	uh wh[at]- i mean a babysitter more more or less	0
agent:that's okay too|user:[laughter]|user:i really don't have a vision	[laughter-yeah]	0
agent:i'm i'm noticing that too and and i notice the the a terming [vocalized-noise] emerging called solo parents that i am very aware of|user:all the time|agent:[vocalized-noise]	yeah	1
agent:city works stuff like that|agent:if nothing else see how the|agent:to do some kind of public work i guess just to get them_1 i guess involved with community maybe you know just community activity	yeah i think something like the Peace Corps is a bit harsh	0
agent:decide if that's what they enjoy doing something|agent:and that got you involved real good and it i think it starts kids out on the right track and it lets them_1|agent:right that's see that's what we did in Girl Scouts and	yeah i think	1
agent:and stuff like that [noise] so|agent:in high school i would volunteer at a nursing home|agent:to learn how to volunteer as they get older i know i did you know in li[ke]- Girl Scouts and everything and after that	they	0
agent:[laughter] are you seri[ous]-|user:you know it was and you know and and they and we didn't have power for a week and there are still people who don't have power it's|agent:golly	i[t's]- oh yeah it's been over	0
agent:well that's good that's great|user:to come volunteer or to have their organizations come volunteer to help clean up the streets|user:and and they're you know putting out ads and now for people	because we have you know every[where]- everywhere that a tree is down people need help and	0
agent:i just you know it just tears your heart out to|agent:yeah it's like i say it's not a lot but it helps people like this last couple we helped you know they were in their eighties and she was bedridden and|user:that that that's real good and i and i bet it gives you a real good feeling to be doing that	yeah	1
user:you know|agent:oh yeah that's true that's true|agent:right	people get shipped off and then you know	0
agent:good good that's great|user:everything you know we got lucky we had no damage to our house or anything|agent:yeah	so the rest'll just have to come with time	1
agent:yeah i agree they|user:my problem with capital mur[der]- capital punishment is they don't carry it out|user:but	so if they're going to have it to me they ought to do it	1
user:[noise] that's my biggest problem is|agent:i i'm wondering though|agent:yeah	even if you give them the death penalty	0
user:like capital murder|user:uh i- i i don't know about if y[ou]- if they was|user:but you know	and then if they were married then what would you do	1
user:just like if a man and wife is fighting|user:but|user:you know	and he kills her that he shouldn't die because it might been accident	0
user:and up in another state i think it was Ohio where they don't have|user:there's a lot of circumstance sometimes i even feel like|agent:so under the circumstances	uh	1
user:[laughter]|agent:well see he shouldn't have been trying to slit her throat [laughter-anyway]|user:he shouldn't have hit her in the stomach i don't care	but he did both	1
agent:um|agent:yeah|user:no she she wouldn't have got no property see there was no grounds for divorce she was she wanted out cause she had a boyfriend and it was weird	but uh the capital punishment i don't know actually what they give the death penalty for	0
user:not anymore [noise]|user:they know they got the death penalty but that don't mean nothing|user:they're not they don't know when they going to die	[noise]	1
user:but i think they going to have to do something|agent:i|user:yeah	to make people wake up like on especially the drug dealers	0
agent:yeah|user:people's been bought out|agent:hum	you know	0
agent:yeah when you think about how many people die from drugs you know ultimately|user:they know they're not going anywhere|agent:when you think about it	[noise]	0
agent:i think that that they have much i like that they've changed it to lethal injection rather than you know the electric chair or|user:but i don't know too much about the death penalty|agent:i agree	yeah	0
agent:uh-huh|user:now you know sometimes i can understand maybe if they robbed something they didn't mean to do it okay but how many times you going to go by that|agent:yeah	how many times you going to this person keep killing so	0
user:all righty|user:and it is nice talking to you|agent:okay	oh it's fun i ca[ll]-	1

user:but you know|user:exactly|agent:uh and the kids really spend more time at school or with a babysitter then they do with their parents	uh i wonder by the time they get through paying out for all the day care center	0
user:exactly|agent:and when we started out well we started out in first of all in an apartment and then rented a a duplex|user:yep	sure	1
user:it really is awful|agent:yeah|user:they're like between a rock and a hard spot	i think maybe the company should do more with day care centers and	0
agent:yeah|user:ten or fifteen minutes around a lunch hour or|user:knowing that you have to leave them everyday if you can go in and see them for	just know they're close by	1
agent:well we're supposed to get rain but no [laughter] snow|user:so it's supposed to be real bad driving tomorrow afternoon|agent:oh me	[laughter]	1

agent:i joined the marching band|agent:and uh besides it being uh close and being a uh major university in the big ten a prestigious conference|user:oh	[laughter]	1
user:i think uh|user:he went the other route|agent:uh-huh	i think the advise i'd give to parents would be to start when they're like four years old today [laughter]	1
user:didn't find the atmosphere there what i quite expected so i came back and went to Cal State|user:the University of Utah and|user:i went off to i grew up in California and i went off to	and so i kind of do what you did only by route of another school	0
agent:country|agent:well known throughout the|agent:uh	right right the reputation	0
agent:[laughter] i took a couple of semesters of graduate school there myself|user:hey i'm headed there [laughter]|agent:isn't uh that well known for their academics	well they have the master of liberal arts there	0
agent:so i quit doing that several years ago|user:it's true|user:right	and and just lived the easy life	1
user:[laughter]|agent:whether you like the mascot or not or whether it's close by|user:yeah	yeah that's true	1
agent:that was fun uh lived on Tombstone pizzas and Coca-Cola [laughter]|user:uh i really i miss college i had a good time|agent:being in the band was about the only entertainment i had	yeah	1
agent:where you're educated in the first uh ten years i guess|user:that's funny|user:yeah	that would be interesting	1
user:just because it usually gives a summary of the|user:i always try to read the Sunday paper|user:and then i usually end up flipping through CNN and Headline News during the evening	the week's hot events	1
agent:extraordinarily trite|agent:since i don't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be|agent:um	right	1
agent:and i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint|user:uh-huh|agent:both the people and the inc[idences]- incidences	really	1
user:so i started questioning|user:as the you know news articles or whatever they had they had already been familiar with|user:nearly the same way	just how	0
agent:of Cronkite and he did a a pretty good job The Huntley Brinkley Report was quite excellent over the years|user:uh-huh|user:uh	yeah we	0
agent:fill-ins you know [laughter]|agent:and i don't need their|user:really	[laughter]	1
agent:so i that's kind of my favorite|agent:uh but i keep coming back to that one|user:sure	does it give a pretty good overview of everything or like	0
user:uh for the last couple of months we got you know an introductory subscription so we decided to try it because|user:well we're working on a Newsweek|agent:and it just seems to fit nicely so that i can get it read in about three days	prior to that all we got were	0
user:i- i even i enjoy reading T News|user:no|user:[vocalized-noise]	i try to catch it	1
user:you have different|agent:no|user:and the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is um Talking Fingers do you have that	telephone numbers that you can dial	0
user:yeah it really is nice i mean because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk and find out about|user:it really is|user:it	so that is something you might keep your eyes open for i think it's it's catching on throughout the country	1
agent:uh-huh|user:yes um it's it's funny because um i know people at that are in all three and people that work you know i know someone that w[orks]- works in all three different stages like you said and i have known you know people close to me that have been in all three and i have seen them like go from where they're in an apartment building they we call it um|user:uh-huh	well we have high rises and it's just for elderly people you know or most of most of one of their spouses has already passed away	0
agent:enjoyable for them that'd that'd be one thing i'd look for along with the uh health care aspects to make sure they had you know that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses|agent:um|agent:so i think those kinds of things to make it more home like and to make it more	uh-huh	1
agent:a headquarters or something anyway where they they staffed it three shifts a day so that someone if they needed someone they could ring and and someone could come to their house|user:it sounds like uh an apartment or some|agent:wasn't a house really it was it was more like a	oh yeah	1
user:uh-huh yeah|agent:and i guess that that it was a pilot program i think where she lived so it's probably not widely available|user:yeah	that's what like well um	1
agent:[noise] that's when it's important to really check out the medical aspects of it when you're when you're in something like that that they'll get the kind of medical care they want without or [noise]|user:uh-huh|user:well yeah	uh-huh	1
user:yeah they're going to get better|user:um-hum|agent:well [noise] they did have a fairly decent year finally this year at least they're coming around	i mean	0

agent:uh-huh|user:who is it Michael Irvin|user:um	[vocalized-noise] he said that uh	0
user:what [laughter] oh okay [laughter] maybe i'll call you back after [laughter] after the recording is finished|agent:talk much more about that but i just thought i'd throw that in there [laughter]|agent:anyway i guess we can't	actually i think we have talked about football for five minutes i- i can't remember	1
user:all that impressive i guess|user:[laughter] since they've been to Phoenix they haven't been uh|agent:and yeah oh of course	i guess i've always been a Cowboy fan other than that i mean you know when i've you know when you grow up in a city that has the you know one of the greatest football teams until the last few years you kind of tend to	0
user:thirty or thirty two for really good tickets see they they sectioned it out even more they used to just have like uh first of all it was all one price and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else|agent:again what are they going up to thirty bucks or something|user:i think tickets are yeah	and now they're sectioning it off to like from the	0
user:where you could get that was real close to the good section [laughter-but] [laughter-in] [laughter-the] [laughter-little] [laughter-bit] [laughter-cheaper]|user:i didn't really think about that i just remember trying to figure out|user:um you know i'm not sure i'm not positive i didn't	but not that i'll ever go i hadn't been to a Cowboys game last time last time i went to the Cowboys game was during that um NFL strike or the when they had the scab team teams in there	0

agent:now they don't want the money for food that's for sure|user:these people are there to get money for drugs i mean they don't want the money so uh so they can do something else with it|user:and you can tell by the people who are always caught that	[noise]	0

agent:i- i was going to say i've seen in some of these um local mail order catalogs they've got trash can dividers for for home owners who don't have those it it it like cuts [vocalized-noise] your trash can in half so you could put cans on one side and and other on the other side so i think i think a lot of people are jumping on the band wagon|agent:yeah|user:right uh-huh that makes it kind of easier then you remember you know	um-hum	1
agent:no it's it's really bad to not break down|user:um-hum because_1 that's something that doesn't go back into the soil does it doesn't break down|agent:i mean that would be great	um-hum	1
user:i think they're one of the|agent:so i was really glad to see that|user:do they well good	businesses at large that do things like that they're more aware of it	0

user:local|user:we have uh uh a|agent:some memories	station uh on our cable network here that uh is showing all the Miss Marples	0
agent:i bet it was|user:[laughter-we] [laughter-get] [laughter-things] over and over so if we miss them_1 we can catch them_1 later and that Gardens of the Worlds was absolutely glorious it was|user:[laughter-so] [laughter-we] [laughter-get]	uh Audrey Hepburn was narrating it	0
user:just uh|user:when i was in Houston there was one station of|agent:silly	it was uh the University of Houston station	0
user:well the thing i liked about it was that it was|agent:well i guess there were i guess it was pretty popular because there was quite a lot of Twin Peak conversation|agent:oh	so unconventional that you couldn't predict what was coming next	1
agent:sorry i missed that one|user:it had a lot of things like that thing to make you|user:anyway	keep watching just for the novelty and the surprise of it	1
agent:um-hum|user:San Francisco station and a San Jose station but neither one of them_1 was very clear they were both|agent:yeah	barely adequate	0
agent:the rest like i said the rest of them i've been trying to to pay off and uh|agent:yeah oh yeah i i do that i do that but|user:but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline	uh-huh	1
agent:wonderful features they're there when you need them|agent:so but i haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards there's you know they have uh|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:yeah that's one way to do it because that that forces you to pay for it instead of saying well i'll just pay on it this month and [laughter]|user:when it comes in|agent:uh-huh	yeah	0
agent:well i've enjoyed talking to you|user:well i've enjoyed talking to you|user:yeah	and maybe we'll get to talk again	0
user:and it's a really heinous crime|user:i feel if a person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt|user:i- i have some feelings about it in the sense that	i feel like the Bible says an eye for an eye	1
agent:um|user:into uh committing murder get getting rid of her husband|agent:uh-huh	i don't know if you're familiar with it Pamela Smart	0
user:had a lot of influence on them and they probably would have never done something like that|user:i think she probably|agent:yeah	if it wasn't for the crime of passion type of thing	1
user:and then you know spend the time say life imprisonment|user:the the other the other hand where you say you know if there's just that slim chance that they didn't do it|user:but if there's	then at least they have a chance to	0
user:but you know i- i- i saw i can't figure out what people are doing any more|agent:that was something wasn't it uh it's unbelievable this|user:yeah really	i mean it's getting so bad	0
user:that if they're in prison that gives you the chance to|user:if someone is guilty of a terrible crime or they're a serial killer or mass murderer|user:and the other point someone made at one one time was that	um get into the person's mind	0
agent:huh|user:uh of sound mind where they knew what crimes they were committing i mean people know what they're doing|user:you know even if it took five years i think that if at that time you you feel that they were guilty or that they were	you know that that i really do i believe that that capital punishment should be there	1
agent:and then uh then you hear about ones that are on early release going out and|agent:and|user:exactly same thing here and that's that's what they did	yep	0
user:on their own|agent:that's true|user:you know	and they don't really feel the family um closeness that we had when oh when i was growing up	0

user:i do i- i don't know what to do about it i wish i did|agent:[laughter]|user:i think all our laws are are really screwed up	but uh	1
agent:yeah|user:and things like that|user:and whether or not to uh institute you know capital punishment where it was necessary	that has to	0
user:so you have people walking the streets that are|user:it's so hard to get people even institutionalized because they're overcrowded|user:mentally incompetent you know uh like deranged	child molesters	1
agent:i think my standard thing when i have company and i'm not too brave trying new recipes so a lot of times i will get the grill out and sometimes we do like surf and turf like we'll get some little filets wrap them_1 up with bacon and then maybe do some little salmon steaks at the same time so that's my husband's deal he's out there you know [laughter] [laughter] with the grill trying to get those things he likes to put sometimes even hickory chips on the barbecue you know get a little different flavor|user:but uh|user:[noise] pardon me [noise]	yeah	1
user:tastes pretty good gives it a kind of a hickory flavor|agent:um okay_1|user:mix all that up together and put it on the steak	but uh grill i have i-	0
agent:yeah|user:yeah uh you mean Thanksgiving|agent:well what kind of things do you normally have with it people have different ideas of what goes with it	uh i- i can make a meal just out of the	1
agent:well yeah|user:so being from the north i guess corn bread and black eye peas are str[ange]- are strange to [laughter-you]|agent:and you got to have your pumpkin pie	most people never	0
agent:the the hoagie steak that they they sell|user:yeah|agent:you know kind of uh rolls that they have here it was a harder crust and some of the hoagies were cooked like the Philadelphia um steak	but uh Thanksgiving i- i don't really care that much for turkey	0
user:well|agent:i think last let me try to think i think the last time we had a big meal like that we did have both i think we did have both on Thanksgiving [noise] just in case people you know have a variety|user:yeah i much prefer ham than i do turkey on Thanksgiving	plus ham [vocalized-noise] if you're going to give a	0
user:and i guess you get tired of it or whatever and it doesn't seem like it's|agent:um-hum|user:but of course you you know you eat day in and day out at one p[articular]- particular place	as good as as people say it is	1
user:they'll have broccoli and they'll have squash and|user:like they'll have uh|agent:um	cauliflower all on the same day	1
user:yeah and every once in a while they'll have dressing|user:yeah|agent:and [laughter-he] said tuna salad shouldn't taste garlicky [laughter] but everything always seemed to have a garlic flavor to it	but uh whoever makes it uh	0
agent:pretty good|user:TI cafeteria too in the mornings [vocalized-noise]|user:yeah they have muffins there at the	yeah they got uh blueberry and	0
user:um yep|agent:we all indulge right|agent:oh well	but i love to cook	0
agent:and uh same goes for the seafood of course to there's not much smack right here out in the middle of nowhere|user:naturally [noise]|agent:we haven't found a who[le]- you know the are the best Mexican food we've found is back in Houston	yeah	1
agent:instead of the seafood|user:yeah|agent:yeah uh it's been a while since i've been there i was always jumped on the steak whenever i went there	yeah they they had they had really nice Alaskan king crab of course it was expensive though dinner for two was about fifty bucks	0
agent:oh|user:and then go sit down and they they fry it out and season it the way you want it seasoned and then they bring it out to you|user:and then you drop it off at the uh grill	and the price is really reasonable the the drawback is that	0
agent:yeah uh|user:but if the food is good and the price is decent and the service is lousy i have a tough time going back again|agent:right	course a yeah yeah i mean it's it's not worth the hassle just for the good food there's plenty of places that have good food	1
user:uh|agent:yeah|user:which is sort of indicative of the whole problem	well gosh	1
user:here i don't know if they're over in Texas yet i know they're in Louisiana it's called Ryan's|user:there's a family restaurant|user:but we've got a uh family	um	0
user:can't complain too much they they they have people come around and uh|agent:so you can't complain about that really|agent:yeah right	deliver your your meal from the kitchen if you ordered a steak or something	1
agent:made you reconsider hm|agent:[laughter]|user:and we got one in Raleigh here and i thought it was pretty bad until i had gone to those ones in Charlotte	yeah we we figured this is probably the best one	1
agent:and they're just huge then there you know there the meat is just massive|user:um-hum|agent:that you want to to cook you know filet or T bone or whatever it is	yeah	1
agent:yeah i'm not sure where all you know he's Texas bound obviously|user:that's pretty interesting i've never heard of anything like that|agent:yeah yeah if you're ever in or around the area do give it a try because it's really good food	yeah [laughter]	1
agent:oh well|user:we got lots of Kuwaitis and Iranians and Iraqis but [laughter]|user:well come to think i've never even seen a Mexican here	gosh	1
agent:Denny Crum|user:who's the coach's name|user:yeah	yeah that sounds familiar	1
agent:in Denison|user:where are y'all living now|user:really	Denison	1
agent:i haven't watched it this year because_1 Louisville's out of it this year|agent:and uh|agent:yeah well the uh NC double A tournament's going on right now	how come	1
agent:one we only had one senior on the team|agent:we only had|user:uh-huh	so they'll be back	1
agent:on national TV he messed up but uh|user:[laughter] on national TV|user:him	yeah it's all politics	1
agent:yeah she she never even got out of elementary school|agent:[vocalized-noise] yeah|user:his elementary school wife	oh really	0
user:huh|user:yeah|agent:yeah these were young kids too they couldn't have been out of middle school	well	0
agent:in North Garland he goes t[o]-|user:what school system does he go to|agent:yes	okay	1
agent:well would|user:no i want that [laughter] i think it would be better for the teachers and for the children because we would do away with so much of the burn out that we have i know when you get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school|agent:if there was an opportunity for teachers to teach year around	then it's like they've lost so much ground we spend at least the first six weeks just backing up reteaching what they had the year before	1
agent:between|user:there's different ways to do it|agent:well how do they do it do they put uh long do they put two or three week breaks	like i i think going two six weeks and then having two two weeks off	0
agent:but they resented the fact that he would try to save some costs there|agent:that that's not what he was hired for|agent:and some of the people who were administrators saying that that uh	well you know he did [noise] supposedly cut administrators but what they've done is create other offices for those same people	0
agent:[laughter]|agent:and and|user:no we do not	no [laughter]	1
user:i don't know|user:[laughter] i don't know no telling|agent:that's interesting and how many administrators is that going to take	and you know at non graded schools they've had one in Gladewater for years and years and years if we could just let these kids go at their own rate i have children even i i teach Chapter one	0
agent:i'm trying to think how much longer i had a conversation week or so ago and we got carried away and they cut it beeps in at ten minutes so|agent:um|agent:anyway	i know it i know it	0
agent:yeah|user:like our principal says i want every child to be on task all the time|user:you know always objectives you know it's like there's not a whole lot of you know fun time like we used to have in school	and you can't do that as adults	0
agent:prevent that or|user:yeah|agent:exactly and when i'm sitting here on the sofa cross-stitching and all of a sudden somebody a man's got their hand on my door knob it's like uh like oh no and so i don't i don't like that and i guess the only way to prevent it would be just to pass a city ordinance to	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:and they all say that they're the best Visa but you know i definitely have the one that i've so far [noise] picked out to be the best you know because of a low interest rate or whatever you know very rarely do you receive one that has a real low interest rate they're always more expensive and they	uh you know if you stay with a if you stay with a good one for the while you get a good credit rating and you get a good um	0
agent:and i did it for a long time and and i just i feel like that was one i thought of that right off|user:uh-huh|user:[noise] it takes uh	yeah they ask you a lot of they ask you a lot of personal questions and they	0
agent:rationally explain the subconscious understanding that you know there's there's a more gullibility here when there's not a|user:[noise]|agent:and i notice that and it's almost like there's a a subconscious understanding i think it's spiritual that you can	huh	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh|agent:yeah	like this is a charitable organization but actually it's not it's a come on so that they can get your name and phone number	0
agent:you know i really think this is good and that well i don't know i think we need that but i know i need it but um the only thing i would have thought of is my husband just said this he said public [laughter-bathrooms] he [vocalized-noise]|user:yeah|user:[vocalized-noise]	um-hum	1
agent:that's funny|user:they don't have enough stalls in women's bathrooms as they do men's bathrooms|agent:uh-huh	so that men you know because men design these things men can go in and use the urinal or use the toilet but their lines are always you know they go through much faster	0
user:well some feel it's rewarding i don't know you know|user:it you know the people who do it|user:i'd have to say that uh	but uh	1
agent:volunteer work here and there and every once in a while i'll do uh a uh local Big Brother Big Sister thing|agent:i mean i'm all for donating my time to worthy causes like i do some|user:so you're looking at the Peace Corps or sabbatical maybe or you know i don't know i mean but uh	um-hum	1
agent:um-hum|user:you know and some of that but|user:to see the other cultures or	uh to do that i don't know i'd have to be	1
user:so|agent:oh|user:they're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off	it is something that i think	1
user:yeah maybe a little bit in that perspective but uh|agent:time|agent:and to decide what they want to do and the Peace Corps or something like that is probably useful as as that kind of a	i know a lot of people that have gone in the military i mean i[n]- you know when they're	0
user:i- i i don't|agent:but i don't and none of my|user:yeah	didn't mean to cut you off there	1
agent:not a whole lot|user:yeah|agent:oh probably five or six	oh i've done maybe four or five	1
user:i had uh let's see i've had fishing|agent:and i haven't gotten a one of them_1 yet when i've called|agent:i i would enjoy talking about	and uh	1
agent:and i can't even|agent:i told this woman that my hobby was gardening|agent:the switchboard called me so i was caught a little off guard and i couldn't think of anything at all so i started [laughter-making] [laughter-stuff] [laughter-up] [laughter]	and you've probably never gardened in your life [laughter]	1
user:right yeah we built up our we built up boxes and put them_1 in that so that they would drain because_1 our soil is so bad|agent:lot of uh oh [laughter] some some plant food once a month|agent:yeah yeah as as long as you give it uh good drainage and uh	where i live do you live in Texas or	1
agent:yeah every year uh there's some freeze damage and i lose different uh variety of shrubs|agent:yeah|user:pine needles and everything else we could think of hopefully it'll drain this year	yeah	1
user:all year|agent:yeah i don't do much with flowers myself i just get a lot of ever[green]- evergreen type shrubs some uh some uh dwarf Burford hollies and Yaupon hollies|user:puts a lot of color out there	right	1
user:yeah we do it my husband does most of the mowing and|agent:do you do your own uh lawn maintenance or do you hire somebody to uh to do that|user:oh really	edging and all that stuff	1
agent:um-hum|user:i would like a self-propelled one i think|user:huh	that might make it easier	1
user:yeah|agent:uh i think it's probably because we lived out in the country somewhat and uh there just wasn't the emphasis on keeping the yards looking real nice|agent:um not nearly as much as here	yeah i lived in a town it was a college town in Virginia and i mean people kept their lawns mowed but they sure didn't get into it like they do here in Texas	0
agent:it's nice when the builders plant trees for you when when they build the house|user:yeah yeah|agent:you'd think that that would be the first thing they would do as far as the yard goes is to plant a tree	yeah did they not put any in in your neighborhood	1
agent:um-hum|user:red oaks and things like that and trying to bring them_1 back and start them_1 but|user:my um husband's father has a place out in East Texas so he's always digging up little	so far we haven't had much luck	1
agent:really well that's good for trees i don't think they do that for shrubs|user:but Calloway's has kept theirs forever so|agent:yeah	yeah	1
agent:but once they uh drop the prices a little bit i'll be out there uh picking up a few more shrubs to fill in where we're [laughter] where my dead shrubs are right now i haven't even pulled them_1 out of the ground yet|agent:so|user:yeah i've i've noticed that they haven't had anything great	right yeah	0
agent:but i do have some really nice Boston ivy on the west side of the house|user:yeah|agent:but mine keep dying back down to the ground so i haven't had that problem yet	oh	0
user:back when i had time to watch TV oh maybe last year when i wasn't doing aerobics and work wasn't quite as busy as it's been lately um|user:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh but those are probably about the only two that i that i usually [laughter] with any regularity	i liked The Wonders Year's and uh	1
user:yeah|user:yeah|agent:yeah i like the lessons it's a good uh good it's got a lot of good morals to it so i enjoy that one	i like uh what is it on Tues[day]- oh i think Coach is kind of funny on Tuesday night	1
user:uh-huh|user:sorry mom|agent:so she's been ge[tting]- she's been hearing about the the different calls and i've i've been in the middle of tests and stuff so i keep you saying oh press three [laughter]	yeah [laughter]	1
agent:and so i never had a chance and even when i was in school of course i always had classes about that time|user:um-hum|user:um-hum	uh-huh	1
agent:let's see i can't oh gosh that that probably wipes out my whole inventory of TV shows other than um PBS i|agent:[noise] oh yeah i hadn't heard that one|user:that was always fun [laughter]	yeah	1
agent:oh|agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh	and they had CNN	0
user:uh-huh|agent:yeah because i i can't remember where i've seen clips of that but they were showing highlights of it and stuff and i was thinking who'd think this is really up my alley for half an hour you know if i'm going to spend my time but it was|agent:oh golly	yeah	1
user:uh they had a|user:yeah i'd seen the storm you were talking about when it hit um up around the Chicago area|agent:it was it was it wasn't supposed to be as bad they they have i g[uess]- i- i guess apparently you know ice storms here occasionally but never anything this bad this late in the season	little film clip about how bad it was up there and i just could not believe how much ice that thing was carrying with it	1
user:by the time it [vocalized-noise] gets lunch time|user:twenty five days of really cold weather and of those|user:all winter long we might end up with	as as long as the wind's not blowing it's bearable	1
user:it's not a long lasting snow it'll be there they may have a week of it then it warms back up into the|user:snow up there but it's|user:they get	high thirties and forties	1
agent:i forgot all about that that it had to be pressed|user:[noise] okay [laughter]|agent:[noise]	[laughter]	1
agent:[laughter]|user:they like that but um as far as that goes like we play games i play like Old Maid and Fish with them|agent:yeah	and w[e]- we play board games and when it's ni[ce]- like i'm from Pennsylvania so when it's nice out	0
user:um-hum|agent:participating but you're not you know i mean at least you're encouraging them_1 on and stuff and that's because_1|agent:you're you're	yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:and the younger kids are at home and i like to spend time with them so|agent:hum	i don't i you know	1
user:[noise] well see they're um we're all|user:yeah|agent:so you you had a lot of games and things you played even when you were kids with the ones that y[ou]-	like we're all pretty close together like m[y]- my sister that's closest to me we're only fourteen months apart	0
agent:but it's so expensive man|user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter-i] [laughter-can] [laughter-imagine]	but yeah it's so it would be really hard now to have twelve children	1
agent:you don't expect anything because there is not enough to go around for everybody so you you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself if you really want it|user:i- i think they do|agent:sometimes i think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though you know i mean	um-hum	1
user:and then like my mom and dad because there's so many of us and because of the way|user:and then|agent:[laughter-wow] you've really got [laughter-responsibilities]	the laws are you know now if we want to drive we have to pay for our own insurance on our cars	0
user:[laughter]|agent:last uh no i do enough other things i don't feel guilty about [laughter-that] last year this is i'm almost ashamed to admit it but last year for the very first time i did mow the grass my first time in my whole life|agent:[laughter] no well	oh	1
user:and uh|user:but uh i enjoy going and cutting the grass i like the way it looks|agent:yeah	i also have o[ther]- other garden equipment like uh	0
agent:um [noise] essentially you know cutting it um probably more like every four or five days and so it's still short enough so that you can mulch it back into the grass and never bag it for one thing um cuts down on waste for landfills and all of that|user:yeah|agent:system that they're trying to promote here which is uh they don't bag it as they call it	uh-huh	0
agent:it ta[kes]- takes him a lot less time|user:maybe there's something i can try this time around|agent:um into the grass	[noise]	1
user:i've got to h[old]- actually hold it as long as i can uh as long as i can make the grass|user:i know in the summer time i've got to uh|agent:right	i can't	0
agent:right|user:you know the clumps that uh that occur but i try to leave it down there|agent:um-hum	i did pick up uh	0
agent:oh well [laughter]|agent:[laughter]|user:it's [vocalized-noise] it's not [laughter-working] [laughter] it's getting it's shrinking down it's getting small	but it uh it's still grass it's it's dried up grass and [laughter-it] it just stays there it doesn't turn into dirt	1
user:yeah|agent:no chemicals and plus then you can use it as a fertilizer and not have to worry about spreading those chemicals like on your lawn or your bushes or whatever|user:chem[icals]- no chemicals in it	i um i'm seriously thinking of discontinuing the chemical service because of the uh	0
agent:Cindy have you seen Dances With Wolves|user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	no i haven't have you	1
agent:and when they were trying to film that the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Young's buffalo|user:uh-huh|agent:uh who's who's being supposedly run down by a buffalo	uh-huh	1
agent:and uh the costuming|agent:yeah|user:the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful	uh-huh really	1
agent:oh i didn't see that|user:um actually have been to the movies um i think the last movie i saw was Misery|agent:what have you seen lately	oh very suspenseful	1
user:so|agent:oh yeah|agent:yeah	but [laughter] so yeah we just haven't had the time to go to the movies [noise] lately	1
user:uh-huh|user:[noise]|agent:um some aspects of the movie that aren't the main aspects	now suppose that	1
agent:uh Sleeping With the Enemy with Julia Roberts|agent:[laughter] all right last thing i saw was um i think|user:okay [laughter]	oh i hadn't seen that but i've heard that it's real good	1
agent:and the drugs let them come back|user:yeah yeah yeah|agent:well i don't a better word to say than like asleep or in a coma for a long time	uh-huh but the drugs [vocalized-noise] didn't work for long and they started having real bad side effects	1
user:all it was they wasn't mild you know they was just|user:yeah|agent:oh um	bad side effects	0
agent:well there was a movie out it's been on cable i get cable and there's this thing with uh Danny De Vito called Twins|user:it was really good|agent:um	oh i've seen that yes	1
agent:um|user:now as far as let's say heavy violence i can't handle|user:i enjoy a lot of movies	i'm not into that	1
user:yes yes|agent:you know and i got a lot of really weird ideas from that goofy movie|user:oh uh-huh	yes	1
agent:oh maybe about ten and we rented Charlotte's Web okay|agent:oh but i remember i was with a friend of mine had uh three kids and the little boy must have been|user:they hadn't really distinguished it's just a movie you know i try to say it's just a movie but no mama i've seen it [laughter]	oh uh-huh	1
agent:i don't know and they they do have a variety of topics my first one was the toughest it was something like discuss pollution [laughter]|agent:how weird|agent:um	[noise]	1
agent:but uh couple of days ago it was in uh mid uh thirties at night and only warmed up to about forty five in the daytime|agent:no|agent:yeah	yeah	1
agent:i think you know we just h[ave]- every once in a while have epidemics of|agent:of course i don't know that that's real[ly]- really weather related|agent:either sinus problems or like i say colds or flu or whatever	uh-huh	1
user:yeah|agent:or right after it got through snowing you could go out in short sleeved shirt and it wasn't that uncomfortable|agent:and be sun shining	uh-huh	0
agent:the ice ages and everything and it's real interesting|agent:effected|agent:ice flows and the ice age and how the weather	uh-huh that sounds like it yeah that sounds yeah i imagine it would that this	0
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:it's nice the best time to come up here is like in in the fall in the late fall and look at the leaves turn colors because that's that's something that you just can't paint a picture of or	and the cold weather is starting to come in when the leaves start turning colors	0
user:oh sure because it's so warm|agent:a lot of our trees and things now are are starting to bud out i sure hope we i sure hope we don't get a hard freeze [laughter] t[o]- to kill everything now|agent:yeah	[laughter-yeah]	0
agent:but uh|user:yeah|agent:bugs as fleas ticks and stuff like that	how long have you been with TI uh	1
agent:sounds like it|user:yeah it was quite a session that disrup[ted]- disrupted my whole summer of course|agent:wow	five days a week but it was an absolutely fascinating experience	1
agent:um-hum|user:D N A testing was entered as evidence|user:we haven't we were a landmark case it was the first time in the state of Ohio that um	and they were being the judge was being especially careful that everything was done correctly so there couldn't be a a mistrial of any kind	0
user:uh and we were sequestered|agent:um-hum|user:and the judge was extremely concerned for our welfare if we were well if we were comfortable and uh things of that nature which made us feel good	but the makeup of the jury uh was truly a cross section of uh you might say a cross section of a country	0
agent:yeah|user:and he was right there also|user:well um if you're taking notes you're missing something	but uh	0
agent:um-hum|user:uh by the same token we had um|user:uh back uh in a hundred years ago was fine but that it needs to be more refined for today's standard of living and the the uh level of education of them of so many people now	uh some people who wanted to had vacations planned	0
agent:and not have to go through this process|user:yes|agent:yes i- i think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that uh you know people would get a fair trial	right	1
user:they wound up paying him uh|agent:jeez|user:burned him	the officer of course was fired but they paid the defendant uh three hundred thousand dollars or something to drop the lawsuit	0
agent:[laughter]|user:much recommended|user:yes i saw Home Alone with some friends just a couple days ago i wanted to see it uh because it was uh	uh for months and months and months and it was a a genre that i wasn't in the least bit interested in and i usually when i hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good	0
agent:i was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie because that's uh not really the way comedies are right now|agent:yeah|user:and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used	uh-huh	1
agent:well actually Falls Church Virginia outside the city|user:ha ha|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:[laughter]|agent:oh|user:just just to get a sense for you know how how it affected them	[laughter]	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:[noise]|user:the violence in these films part[ly]- it mean it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book but on the other hand it makes it seem like	i i read an article one time talking about even the [vocalized-noise] the quote unquote realistic movies don't have very realistic effects of the violence the violence can seem very realistic but the aftermath is usually not there	0
agent:uh-huh|user:the from older to younger generation it was it was a classic Greek you know it's European mess going back three thousand years that they're playing with|user:again i didn't have a kid with me and i remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the master and the passing of wisdom	um	0
user:i mean to go to these movies and expect them to be|agent:[laughter]|user:i um i'm i'm clearly enough you know i'm i'm clearly an intellectual snob to be going to these kinds of movies i realize that	you know other than just just good entertainment kind of thing	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:no it could be [laughter] [noise]|user:i mean i don't know if this is old fart talking here or something because_1 i'm not that old [laughter] [laughter-i] [laughter-look] you know those old movies seemed to have had something	that uh that was memorable somehow i don't know what it was	1
user:what she has to go through um support group wise or|user:to help the woman cope with|user:all that good for her as it were had had there been enough adjustments in society	or just all the different aspects that men have developed over the years	0
user:i would say more|user:the fact that they essentially always have been under stress uh|user:you know that's an interesting point that you brought up about the	in the later latter years even those who stayed home had stress but	0
user:really restating some conclusions of some some uh|user:read an article um|agent:yeah	programs or some investigations or research whatever you want to call it into the the actual physical differences between men and women and questioning whether those physical differences	0
agent:right|agent:right|user:for lack of a better term women's libber you know we're just the same as men	well maybe not and and maybe you shouldn't be exposed to the stress the same way that men have have managed to do all these years	0
agent:uh-huh|user:uh a set of not not a specific role let's say let's not say that only the the girls should do the cooking|user:a role for a sex but should there be	but at any given generation or for any given	0
agent:[laughter] whoa [laughter]|user:being a former drug user [laughter]|user:uh	i uh i'd i guess i have to say at this point that i do approve of it	0
user:uh on my job we had a lot of Workmen's Comp cases|agent:uh-huh|user:under the Workmen's Comp	and	0
agent:uh-huh|user:now we've let some people go uh that well it was found that drugs were used in their system now i don't know how TEC would handle it they haven't pursued it you know|agent:yeah	uh if there's some uh problem i know	0
user:yeah|agent:you know exams require that i think they should|user:um-hum	uh-huh	1
agent:then finally the day we declared war was my time [laughter] [laughter-no] [laughter] and so and and my boss has has gone for about like three times i think and i told him he's obviously in a high risk group [laughter]|user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter] i i was giving my boss a hard time because i kept waiting for my name to came come up you know they never they never called me they never you know	[laughter-you're] kidding	0
user:was so|user:i can't believe i'd|agent:yeah	brazen before i'm like i say i'm a former drug user but	0
agent:downward spiral|agent:really|agent:cause that's	uh-huh and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know	1
agent:yeah i mean and they have they have some serious chemicals out there you know like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing|user:oh goodness|agent:type	yeah	1
agent:eighty five something like that and they at that time they had no testing whatsoever|agent:four|user:uh-huh uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:uh-huh yeah|user:you know i grew up in the sixties and back then it was popular you know|user:but i'm proud though that that um	but people have really wisened you know become wise about drugs and	0
agent:uh-huh|user:well [noise] i was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that i've done|user:[noise]	and the last time that um we tackled it i did the kitchen and i had	0
agent:and we put a flat over the top and everywhere you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see [laughter] it seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint|user:uh-huh|agent:the color difference wasn't so bad but uh there was semigloss underneath	oh yeah	1
agent:yeah probably so|agent:yeah|user:and i haven't figured out how to get that off i guess i'll have to take that door down and really get it good	and then we have a two story	1
agent:buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all in a in a wash tub or something somewhere because i'm alway[s]- i'm always afraid that the next coat is not going to match|agent:we're they'll be there for a while we're we're pretty comfortable with that but yeah it it i'm i'm real nervous every time i i open a new can i'm wondering if i shouldn't|agent:yeah yeah absolutely [laughter] yeah we uh we stocked up the first time around but we've definitely got all the formulas on file and uh	uh-huh	1
agent:most of it most of it's in pretty good shape|agent:yeah and i i didn't like that very well so i i moved that but uh|agent:and uh	so where do you live	1
user:like to paint a picture or anything|agent:uh-huh|user:surface like the house	i don't know i can't think of anything else to say about painting	1
agent:uh i really don't care you know i mean|agent:what|agent:i i really	yeah well i question whether it's in their best interests to become a state right now they are a commonwealth and that means that they are under US protection in the event of uh defending their their country	0
agent:the Quebec people that that speak French|user:they have|agent:yes as well as the the um [noise]	yeah uh-huh	1
agent:so they've been talking about this for a long time do you think they're going to ever vote|agent:yes|user:military factions that would oppose each other and and they would vie for leadership and uh the people who are well off there the middle upper class if there is such a thing uh they would probably be at a disadvantage losing possibility of losing their uh their assets or wealth	uh	1
agent:so and it was like they were they're Puerto Rican and were Americans|agent:what i learned from them there was a lot of resentment towards the Americans|user:okay	right	1
agent:yes Cuba's really close [vocalized-noise] but uh Puerto Rica is uh is it's like uh i live in Vermont from Vermont to Florida it's another another uh what fourteen hundred miles across the ocean|user:well Cuba's closer but uh|agent:if you know if it was Cuba	right	1
agent:and i[t's]- and it's very it's like one big rock but uh Puerto Rico has lots of uh|user:uh-huh|agent:and if not it's like i've been to Saint Thomas and it just starts from the ocean up	right	1
agent:oh|user:um this is strange because i pressed one and i thought it said begin|user:um yeah that's what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe well it says why would you what you would have for a dinner party	[vocalized-noise] okay maybe maybe we're all set okay we'll talk for five minutes they interrupt at the end	0
agent:that's always a good thing vegetable trays always go over so well because_1 i think people get tired of eating junk i mean i think they like to have healthy stuff too you know it's|user:it see you don't necessarily have to dip this stuff and um i was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a a vegetable|agent:oh that sounds good	oh yeah it's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party	1
agent:you know because it's you know you have to|agent:oh i think it would it would be a lot of work but um|user:but they look easy enough to make it's not	yeah	1
agent:be uh grown in greenhouses and stuff and in [vocalized-noise]|user:yeah|agent:oh well that's good because i know they've been really expensive lately [laughter] because they weren't in season of course they had to be	yeah i think the uh actually i think they get um some of them from South America	0
user:but uh|agent:[noise]|agent:okay	it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord and you beat this cornstarch right into the mil[k]- the milk you know and it does an excellent job or just hand beat it i guess you could use a hand mixer but	0
agent:oh wow that is really interesting are you saying to use like um for chocolate like unsweetened|user:and when it cools a little they you put um really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter and that makes French vanilla um custard|user:seven to ten minutes and then you can make chocolate or you can take it off	yeah	1
user:yeah but i still think a beater would do it good enough|agent:it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good|user:but um	um the trick is to get the cornstarch	0
agent:and then put that back in the saucepan|user:so|user:i'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg	yep	1
agent:do you do you put it in the refrigerator then or you|user:but um|user:and shake the water off the Saran Wrap and i might put it back on	yeah after well when it starts steaming a lot uh i definitely yeah put it in the refrigerator	0
user:and they were mentioning that and even though Kansas City may have dropped him some other teams may pick him up but the big thing was that Nike|user:so they had uh they're having actually a special on today|agent:uh i didn't know that	uh the athletic shoe company is still going to keep him on as one of there cross trainer sponsors	0
agent:i- i wouldn't know what to do with it|agent:uh|user:that's uh what would you do with all that money	[laughter]	1
agent:some of for most of the people i guess it is for some of them_1 though they do it just for the love of it|agent:yeah well uh|user:i guess anymore it's just a big business	uh-huh	1
user:where he goes out and recruits other|user:uh not necessary they say he's getting around the rules somewhat but it's actually sounds like a pretty good idea|user:started to instigate a program where he's actually	students who don't meet the minimum academic requirements to get into the college and and then qualify for a student athlete position	0
agent:yeah well we veered from the subject [laughter]|user:that's way too much yes it has|agent:uh it's happened too much	[laughter]	0
agent:child rearing or child day care|user:well heck you|agent:uh football basketball and baseball	uh-huh	1
EMPTY	oh go ahead i- i am glad to talk to an expert i always wanted to know who an expert was	1
agent:uh it was it was it was interesting but uh i'm just curious what he has to say now that they've got them_1 all lit|user:no i heard about it though|agent:well did you see Carl Sagan on Sixty Minutes on uh when he was talking about when if if the if the war started in in Kuwait and they'd set those uh all th[e]-	was that before i didn't see it was that before they actually did that or it was w[hat]-	1
user:i- i'll do that in a minute i- i think that the changing you know from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage|user:uh well i'm kind of a car buff myself i was going to ask you another question but uh|agent:i think how do you feel about about all this smog and m[ess]- stuff on cars	you know not not using	0
user:uh oh ye[ah]- i- the same thing about the war uh or related to the war on i was watching CNN and i cannot remember what station it was|agent:but did you have another ques[tion]- you said you had another question|user:i don't think that's a problem i thought i'm saying i was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline	what did you see the advertisements uh	0
user:yeah|agent:but the but when you see when you get up in the morning in in Dallas and and see all that haze from west Texas is that is that pollution|user:oh really yeah there there's probably a lot of natural things uh	uh it i guess it's got to be really i don't know i don't know if it's air pollution it's uh it's dust pollution whether it's natural or not i don't know	1
user:because i think uh|agent:yes yes|user:well you said you were car buff uh i think that uh all of us could use one electric car right now i mean today	you said people drive forty miles and fifty whatever yeah when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car but i think we all could in a family say have an electric car where my one of my daughters or my wife my wife	0
user:yeah they've got a they've got a area over in the SE building too which is uh|agent:there have been research it was a little light that says solar solar powered research|agent:well th[ere]- there's still a lot of research i was over in in the research lab a couple i guess it's been about a month ago and saw this	but it's a solar	0
user:there|agent:they had one with spots on it and something i didn't go but i[t]- wa[s]- it was showing they i mean uh|agent:well i thought i saw an ad for Volkswagen that had an alcohol	hum	1
user:uh f[or]- on air pollution i- i- i don't know if the automobiles are are the biggest contributor or not really they've got catalytic converters everyone seem to have|user:you know that's one way you know uh|user:whether	gone to that whether they last uh and do a good job and now that they	0
agent:this weekend i cleaned out some closets and i found a bathing suit that i had bought|agent:[noise] a couple years ago i too got married i haven't have any children yet but|agent:this weekend i cleaned out my closets and uh	uh-huh	0
agent:and that was really tough [laughter]|user:um-hum|agent:and then i did a hour of aerobics	oh i bet	1
user:can't just go|user:i am undisciplined in the sense that i|user:well i like	and do exercise	0
user:you know when you get out of shape and you don't|user:good and i get|user:i don't feel	if you're easily tired	1
agent:well i don't you know a lot of people i have a girlfriend that goes for the social aspect of it|user:but i really admire people who can go and work out and|agent:um-hum yeah	um-hum	1
agent:yeah|user:well i guess it's getting late|user:but	and i should	0
user:more women's roles at work which i like in management|user:uh|user:well i have noticed a lot	which that's good i- i guess to have a woman's	1
user:i think|agent:we only have to get up for you know for the daytime feedings|user:yeah	[laughter]	0
user:yeah|agent:i- i- i found it interesting especially uh being from a military background the current fuss over whether women should go into combat or not|agent:but uh	right i thought that was really interesting in the war i figure	1
user:that's right|agent:well they couldn't be worse than some of the men|user:you know if that's what interests them and they think you know they can handle it i think they ought to be able to do it	and i don't	1
user:right they need to give the scholarship to a woman that's true that's true with any case i hate that but|agent:or a Black woman named Rodriguez|user:she got that scholarship	but that is true but	1
user:that's always been strange i thought but some women like to fight it|user:i mean i understand that they're talking about the job [laughter] not the person in the job that's that's always|user:that's never	but	1
user:right|agent:i think i'd be scared of anybody male or female in that position although you see more and more uh more and more of the ladies that are becoming active in politics|user:right right	i know that's true and	1
user:but i don't know it just it just kind of bothers me and that that just may be because we're not used to having|user:uh good and everything but|user:[laughter-yeah] she i mean she seems on the outside	i'm not used to having women	0
agent:yeah|user:do they|agent:oh yeah Houston got a female mayor	i didn't know that	1
user:yeah yeah they always they they say a lot of times that|agent:you know i would i- i- i would dearly love to find out that you know i could i could say well i guess i was wrong about Ann Richards|user:right	you know woman have more emotions and they can or cannot handle a job because of that	0
agent:we don't have quite as many as they do east and west coast but this is kind of the last bastion of the you know the|user:that are in politics down here|agent:this is you know	yeah [laughter]	1
user:however they're going to be able to uh take care of us|user:like like you said it's with man or a woman it sh[ould]-|user:whatever these leaders of ours do that everything's for the good that just	i don't know	1
user:men always did the|user:i guess we're we're kind of the good old boy type atmosphere of|user:i don't know that's really that's really well it's it's so uh	you know the engineering and all this and the technology and men are	0
agent:[noise]	[noise]	0
agent:uh-huh|user:uh the main reason why i'm i'm hanging on to it is because of the business that i'm in|agent:uh-huh	the the home computer business i have a	0
user:and the mainframe has a lot of uh software out there where i use to|agent:uh-huh|user:and uh we also have a tie in to a mainframe out in in Dallas Texas	interface my computer with	1
user:how do how do the users feel about the the system and what are their likes and dislikes|agent:uh-huh|user:quality satisfaction or customer satisfaction	and that's that's uh that's where they they were heading and	0
user:and they've also hooked up to some company|user:where i can send telegrams to any TI site|agent:uh-huh	to allow us to do E-mail and allow it to convert it	1
user:i am not a typist i type with two fingers but i do very well at it|user:and redo it and then give it back to her again than it does for me to sit down and and do it and correct it myself i i|user:it takes me longer to write it	and uh i i do everything i do my only typing do my own foils uh it's just you know it's just so much easier for me to do that	1
user:a transmitter that will pick up the signal from the the monitor|agent:right|user:uh like a print shop or or a thing in the system well we have uh instead of using view view foil machines we have uh	and and transmit it just like a view foil	1
user:it's it's so easy to do uh|agent:[noise]|user:they're uh really not being utilized as much as they had been in the past i'm making some really pretty foils that uh four or five years ago i wouldn't have ever dreamed i could be doing them and	with the with the programs that are out there now	1
agent:so that might lead you to a biased uh decision perhaps if you were uh-huh|agent:uh-huh|user:you are uh sitting in on a jury trial where you might be acquainted with at least maybe not that person but part of their family	i would think so	1
user:that would we find her guilty she would simply flee the state and avoid any prosecution of any kind whatsoever|user:and they proved that she had set fire to her car in order to collect the insurance money|user:because even though they knew	which we did find her guilty against his instruction	0
agent:uh-huh|user:guilty uh|user:he was convinced that the person was not guilty and at the end of their deliberations he finally voted uh	which surprised me that	0
user:only people too in that|user:that after all they're|agent:uh-huh	they're subject to	0
agent:yeah|agent:uh|user:and some of our neighbors down the the lower part uh get their yards flooded every once in a while doesn't get up into the house but it just makes a bit of a mess in the in the yard itself a little bit of debris and a little bit of runoff on the	on the uh grass area it's kind of hard to keep grass in certain areas and i'd never really thought about that but but we're pretty much at the very top of this little hill and all the runoff from	0
user:little strip shopping center but it's several houses down because the property that's the other side of our little wall|user:uh it's kind of a a bad thing to happen but we happen to have landed again in a very lucky spot there is a little business development behind us that's a bit of a a a little bank and a couple of dry cleaning things and|agent:[laughter]	is a triangle shape and the wedge part of the triangle got too skinny to do anything more than put some grass and trees there	0
user:the cheapest house that this this tract development uh sold|user:we were new to the this whole process and all we knew is that it was a|user:i mean that wasn't our consideration wh[en]- when we bought it it was a complete blank lot they hadn't even built the house yet and	so it turned out to be pretty good	0
user:twelve or fifteen feet on one side but on the other side there's over sixty feet before the next house because_1 they they set us back a little ways and they turned it sideways|user:there's there's like|agent:oh that's really nice	so our houses begin to to turn to to make this turn as it were so we're real far away	0
agent:i don't really like that too well i keep telling my husband that our next house is going to sit square in the middle of at least ten acres of land [laughter]|agent:well we bought uh our first house at the end of eighty six and like i said it's out in Rowlett and it's it's real nice it's four bedroom and it's kind of a tract area too we've got people behind us and on both sides of us|user:uh what about your house	[laughter]	1
user:some uh name brand windows|user:i don't know that we've done anything different to prevent ours from doing that but most of our neighbors have ended up replacing them_1 uh buying some nice Anderson windows or some|agent:um-hum	uh one neighbor went with whatever Sears installs and	0
agent:but i bet we've got at least seven more now that are bad|user:it's true|agent:oh yeah	goodness	1
EMPTY	[noise]	0
user:how do you feel about it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college how does that uh|agent:um|user:um-hum um-hum um-hum	how do you feel that is for someone at at that phase in their life	1
agent:yeah|user:yeah i think if there's any major piece of advice i'd give is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt|agent:debts i mean you could have uh	it's not i mean i remember seeing an article one time about	0
agent:above the median|user:[laughter]|agent:i- i just couldn't ima[gine]- i mean it's more money than i make in a year so [laughter] you know it you know me being one person with a	yeah	1
agent:i'd|user:it's the entry into adulthood i think and i think that the best way|user:i mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways but really	to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to	0
user:um-hum|agent:that i know a again from high school that i still keep in touch with that didn't go to college and|agent:you know i- i agree with that because_1 i see people	um-hum	1
user:[noise]|agent:well i i've seen more graduates from MIT and that being|agent:yeah	uh-huh	1
agent:uh is investing in the Air Force and it or the the military itself it's the future|agent:doing their job and spending time with the cadets there|agent:is really beneficial because they see it as	right	1
user:i really haven't seen any movies lately i the only two movies i've seen were uh|user:so|agent:so what movies have you seen lately	uh King Ralph which really was depressing wasn't any any good	0
agent:uh-huh|user:it's a foreign film|agent:what's that	it's a an Italian film about uh	0
agent:uh-huh|user:i di[d]- i thought they did an excellent job of actually aging the person you know from when he was a little kid to little older to little older to except the last the the very last you know the last person|agent:uh and the little boy was good too	the last actor that played the kid	0
agent:but uh|agent:yeah that's true yeah|user:well it depends on what mood you're in too you know	like for example Tequila Sunrise i liked that	1
agent:because that David Lynch has like a weird style but i didn't think it was really weird you know not as weird as i don't know i we also|agent:they said it's supposed to be really weird but|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:i don't know what else we just saw something recently|user:yeah|agent:yeah that that's sort of the way i feel too	i want to go see The Doors	0
agent:Tom McLaughlin who plays one of the other characters in the band one of the other men in the band|agent:uh not Val Kilmer the um|user:Val Kilmer	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:because i really want to see it i wanted to see it uh about two weeks ago when i had a chance to go see it but i i went home for the weekend and they didn't have it playing home|agent:yeah	for like spring break and	1
agent:uh-huh|user:uh it's a it's called UAB uh university something or other i don't know and they give out like movies they show movies in the theatre|user:well the the good thing about campus is that we have this uh system that uh	for a dollar	1
agent:and and i think if you really like the story going along with it you don't notice that it's a little bit you know it might not have as many camera angles or it may not have you know uh because the you know the character actors the town the community people were just great|user:yeah|agent:and i thought that was that movie really told a good story	right	1
agent:um-hum|agent:hum|user:Laura talks about growing uh right right now she's interested i think in a herb garden she mentioned this morning that she could grow just you know flower box	and i think that's but i think uh	0
agent:um|user:and growing maybe tomatoes or flowers like right now it would be beautiful in in Maryland you know daffodils are just all blooming|user:putting it in pots and putting the pots just on our steps	so it would be really pretty	1
user:um-hum|agent:it snowed here as late as May before but that was really unusual our our our last freeze is usually about April fifteenth|agent:we hit our we'll hit our last spring freeze	yeah	1
user:right|agent:when it's cooler in the spring then it gets too hot in the summer|agent:because otherwise it's too it gets if you start them	yeah that jeez i never thought of that because see here our growing season is basically done	0
agent:probably not too many people eat it up [laughter-there] [laughter-either] it seems to be kind of a [laughter-southern] [laughter-delicacy]|user:yeah we don't have the right whatever yeah|agent:yeah you probably don't have the right temperatures and stuff	well i think it it it it's getting um a little bit more popular because see there's a lot of the um	0
user:brother's wife you know was talking about|user:yeah we we talked about that too in fact um our sister-in-law Laura's|agent:if you were going to do that you might put some strawberries in there around the edges	you know putting strawberries uh	0

agent:doesn't bother you|user:um drug testing doesn't bother me|user:[laughter]	no uh	1
user:about people|user:well that's true i- i agree that there should be something done|agent:i think alcohol's a a whole lot worse drug and it's more widely accepted	that drink alcohol because i'm sure that there's people that drink and come to work	0
agent:do it do some drugs then that should be their business|agent:you know|agent:in such a way that doesn't inter[fere]- interfere with their responsibilities	course through this i think that they've helped a lot of people also	0
user:that's true|user:that's true|agent:i don't know	yep	0
agent:i you know i heard it through the grapevine so i don't i don't know firsthand but|user:they didn't|agent:that's what you would think but i kind of i that's	okay	0
agent:i don't know anybody personally either|agent:well i think|user:but you but i don't know because_1 i don't know anybody that's had to go through treatment or anything so i really don't know	you know	1
agent:well do you wait until they screw up you know and someone gets hurt|agent:and i guess that there's the other argument is that|agent:no no i agree i think i believe in test for cause if if somebody's performance	get hurt yeah	1

agent:and it's starting to effect you know the economy|user:yeah|user:yeah	sure	1
user:yeah|user:well|agent:you can't do both things well	but on the other hand if it if it needed his personal intervention all the time then it wasn't a good system anyway	0

user:after that experience was|user:and uh i think one of my concerns|user:served on a jury one time	uh finding that	0
agent:[laughter-yes] and it came very quickly surprisingly uh i guess it was uh|user:yeah i think that was a logical decision there|agent:and the life sentence uh she received	um-hum	1
agent:of the jury|agent:taken the time to do the research to answer my own question but i know that at least during the deliberations|agent:i've never	um-hum	1
user:but the uh|agent:um-hum|user:did not make the points	defendant took the stand on his own behalf	1

user:to keep an eye out for it but|agent:yeah|user:you know if it's something really interesting and and then i'll know to	i've got out of the habit of listening to the radio	1
user:all of the um anchors are seem to be like White Anglo Saxon [laughter-Protestant] type people and they all seem to be you know fairly similar and i kind of prefer|user:well i really think so i noticed on channel eight that there's|agent:can you tell much difference between the local radio TV stations	a you know some females i don't recall that they have any female	0
agent:there should be some real opportunity and and some diversity and|agent:uh in some cases the[re]-|agent:totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs but i think that	yeah	1
agent:[noise]|user:yes it's nice bye-bye|agent:[laughter-okay] well good talking to you good night	[noise]	1

agent:i guess the average summer temperature is about eighty uh you know in the eighties|agent:but you could you could walk around outside in New York you could just stay outside in in it you know because_1 it was|agent:yeah like New York was really humid you know you	yeah	1
user:well that's pretty typical though|user:[laughter]|agent:ye[ah]- i'm sure it will in Dallas [laughter-Texas]	uh i don't uh	1
agent:was it snow[ing]- snowing|user:so it's stayed cold for the entire week|agent:uh-huh	um we got one day of snow and one day of ice	1
agent:yeah and people drive like the s[treet]- street is dry|agent:yeah|user:there is no uh ice removal equipment	yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:so they usually get uh worse weather [vocalized-noise] than we do|agent:um-hum	in winter too	1
user:but uh like i said i stayed in today because_1 i picked up a cold the other day so|agent:uh-huh|user:some of the some of the dead shrubs from winter	didn't feel like going outside and doing much	1
agent:uh uh-huh|user:but uh yeah i guess next week's supposed to be real nice outside i hope it is anyway because uh softball season starts and we're ready t[o]- to go outside and do some|user:i don't know	outdoor activities	1
agent:yeah|user:guess i'll have to turn on the weather|agent:get quilts yeah	on the news tonight see what we're supposed to expect	1
agent:yeah my truck's broken down and my house just burned down you know|user:[laughter] my truck is broken [laughter-down]|agent:my wife left me my dog left me you know [laughter]	yeah	0

agent:yeah oh okay i see what you're saying|user:the pieces that have that person|user:he's identified the the people that have written certain songs and he buys the	you know on it huh	1
user:i like the Moody Blues|agent:um|user:[vocalized-noise]	did you like them	1
agent:in all the different areas that's why i was just wondering|agent:oh okay well they're having a lot of recruiting this week|user:just because there's a friend up there [laughter-not] because there's much [laughter-else]	for colleges	1
user:and up her [laughter-nose]|user:this guy had supposedly uh strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat|agent:oh uh-huh	anyway this is happened in nineteen eighty three	1
user:getting cocaine from his client|user:who had been uh|user:and she has since taken off with another lawyer	and then selling it	0
user:i said that i could i could believe in it in certain instances but i would be|agent:but|agent:so	i'd find it hard to levy that against somebody	1
user:what do you think about um|user:[noise]	the way the criminal justice system	1
agent:okay i see|user:to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial|user:well i think the six is called a Grand Jury and that's mostly	or it's whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused of	1
user:and give it y[ou]- give it to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity|user:if you break the sentencing away from the jury|user:it seems like	for something to either go wrong	0
user:they really don't mean anything|user:what bothers me is that uh|agent:no	someone could be sentenced	0
user:they've been ordered|user:that uh|user:i think i heard Fort Worth	to do something because their jail is so overcrowd[ed]- they're not allowed to accept any new inmates now what are they supposed to do	1
user:th[e]- some of them are even allowed to work they can go to their regular job|user:and they are not allowed i mean|agent:they keep	they come home they have to be home by such and such a time	0
user:to check on them|user:and when the parole officer calls|user:they usually install a video monitor in the house	they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it	1
agent:um-hum|user:w[ell]- something that i really don't understand is when someone goes to jail|agent:sometimes it's pretty messed up isn't it	and they have a job in jail	0
agent:yeah but i know families myself that have three and four children in Lubbock|user:more than that|agent:and i know	more than that	1
user:i don't know they could uh some percentage like eighty five percent of their wages|user:like|user:should go	should go toward their room and board	0
user:absolutely|agent:regulations to deal with that they they know how to deal with the penal system and they know how to deal with the criminal but they don't know how to deal with the victim because we as citizens i guess haven't laid anything up there for them to deal with on that aspect|agent:no uh	yeah	1
agent:you know so|agent:that i know of but you know a lot of jurors may just sit there and say yeah he's guilty but i don't have to deal with it from here|agent:and a lot of jurors not	yeah	1
agent:[laughter]|user:yeah i- i pulled for them for the sole reason because i didn't want 49ers to win|agent:yeah that was just a couple of years ago	anybody who plays the 49ers really	1
agent:um|agent:well|user:what other teams uh do you like up there	or do you not watch much football	1
agent:i haven't for some reason have never really gotten enthused about football in the summer f[rom]- from the the the World League|agent:well uh|agent:hum	yeah the temperature's just not right	1
user:and uh|agent:ooh|user:and i live near the coast actually i live like right on the coast of North Carolina	what they they called it like a winter hurricane	0
agent:what kind of weather you having right now|agent:[noise]|agent:yeah right right	well right now we're having nice weather i- i probably say	0
agent:uh-huh bye-bye|user:yeah nice talking to you too|agent:okay well good talking to you	bye	1
user:and the other thing was|agent:smaller classrooms possibly|user:try to get more one on one with the teachers and the and the students if we could	we need to really really to tighten up our discipline in schools because they run here in New England i'm not sure about the rest of the country but i know the schools are almost running rampant up here	1
user:we bought them_1 up and put them in the public schools here in Rhode Island and|user:my i had the same situation here my kids were|user:and	they were not not too too bad and this was going back like ten years i guess ten years ago they were not too too bad at that time	0
agent:and get a lot more money|user:oh yeah it's so it it's so hard and and it's so hard to compete and and that's not one of the things that's gonna make the people like yourself who are just graduating from colleges you know or out across the country|agent:going into elementary education and to teaching and then they looked and saw how much money they got and said well there's a lot of other things I can do	wanna go jumping into a	0
agent:exactly in May|user:and you're finishing up this year huh|agent:yep so	well that's great i i wish you all the best in in your future in your endeavors out there in what ever you are doing	0
agent:that's one end to the other that's true|agent:yes [laughter]|user:that's right across the country i don't think i could [laughter] i don't think i could	i don't think i could spread my patriotism any more than well actually i like uh San Francisco 49ers too but uh	1
agent:but it it worked for them_1 but uh you're right they they kind of|user:and|agent:um-hum	yep but	1
agent:um-hum|user:i like the Giants because of uh Bill Parcells and i like him as a coach and he's he's been for years a a good coach i- i think|agent:um-hum	i'm not sure that they can repeat	0
agent:um-hum|user:the big political football up here you know now they're now they're trying to move the team somewhere else the last i heard|user:with the Sullivan boys and Kiam they didn't really see eye to eye and of course the	boy just kind of [laughter]	0
agent:right and it could end at anytime|user:oh sure because they're they're tenure is [laughter-real] [laughter-short]|agent:and they were talking about uh you know this is one reason they say that that athletes get the money as quickly as they can you know get all the money th[at]- you know	anytime at all yeah but	0
user:i believe that fellow if he had|user:but i like Bradshaw as a quarterback and i think uh Joe Montana's probably one of the finest and John Elway|agent:[laughter]	some different people in front of him	1
agent:[laughter]|user:it sure has and i i'd like to try this thing every once in a while i thought i'd give it a try this afternoon being so rainy i'm locked in up here anyway so|agent:yeah it has	well like i say i-	0
agent:uh-huh|user:but it seems as though if you really want to set a t[ime]- side time to read the Bible and you work and|user:i used to read a lot of uh novels	and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading	1
agent:five|user:i forget the t[itle]- the other well he uh he's also written a lot of children how old is your daughter|user:uh This Present Darkness and uh uh	five	0
agent:oh|user:and the spiritual fights that they get into like|agent:uh-huh	uh	0
agent:ooh they just they're just so suspenseful|agent:no you can't you really can't they are good and|user:yeah can't put them down [vocalized-noise]	uh-huh yeah	1
agent:yeah i'm in a book club and i think i've seen his books|user:yeah uh|agent:yeah oh i think i know who you're talking about uh i've seen i don't think i can pronounce it either but [laughter]	uh-huh	1
agent:[laughter]|agent:yeah|agent:yeah yeah	for some reason that scared me more than anything	1
agent:Cujo did you read that one|agent:i also liked uh|agent:yeah that was good i liked uh	yeah	0
agent:that's that was one of my favorite subjects in school was uh|user:their worthwhile|agent:that's true but i	literature	0
agent:right a lot of people just don't have time to read nowadays|user:a viewing format more or less|user:you know put it into a	uh-huh	1
agent:[laughter-oh] serious|user:okay well we try it like here they show it like every day|agent:oh really yeah that's pretty awesome too i watch it every now and then that's hilarious	and then like on Thursdays is the night where the new ones come on	1
agent:[laughter]|user:uh i don't know but people the other day i went into a bar and this guy asked me to dance all he saw was my hair|agent:cool how long is it	and he goes do you want to dance i turn around and go what	0
user:i just|user:well i i like i|agent:In Living Color or something i don't know	i just {bogused} on all my homework so it really didn't matter [laughter]	0
agent:which basketball|user:which basketball|agent:uh yeah basketball's cool but football kind of after a while	college or	1
user:and everybody was like it was like oh God do you guys really watch that no you know i was like|user:and bowling you know|agent:[laughter] golf yeah	a whole golf tournament it's like for example baseball i hate baseball i mean	0
agent:oh that's cool how long did you live there|user:uh because um i wanted to go to school here|agent:oh really so so why from Argentina why'd you come over here	yeah they have better computer science up here than they than they do down there	1
agent:groovy|agent:that's cool|user:we've been talking for five minutes that's the only obligation we have	and uh well tell your dad that now he owes you five bucks	0
agent:maybe|user:no i don't think it was really corruption that caused it|user:um-hum	or within i think people just started	1
agent:i just i'm rather puzzled about the whole thing [laughter]|agent:or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base such that they didn't they didn't care any more i|user:[noise] i'm not sure	um-hum	0
user:to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve|user:and i think if they would be more bound|agent:okay	then i don't think this would have happened	1
user:um-hum|agent:to be caught in the land slide|user:and it's and it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this	um-hum	1
user:um-hum yeah because_1 we['re]- we're you know we're talking about some companies that have just|user:um-hum|agent:and so you think that it's just gone	like even gave up on getting it back they're even trying any more	1
user:yeah [vocalized-noise] as long as there's enough little companies|user:um|user:you know in case something would happen	we're going to have to have something	1
agent:because that means means i'm not worried enough|agent:and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again|user:[laughter]	i think it could happen yeah	1
user:[noise]	do you are you on a regul[ar]- regular exercise program right now	1
agent:you go through this this is something you go through like every year [laughter]|agent:i know|user:well i'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring	but i	1
user:um-hum no i just got the bicycle out today|agent:you don't have any [laughter-excuse]|agent:yeah it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't	and it was real nice outside had to get out to do something	1
agent:so|user:ah i usually enjoy the exercise i do but uh like i said i'm just not very consistent|user:uh-huh	about maintaining a a program	1
agent:um-hum|user:i've always found that that when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep uh keep something going|agent:yeah that that'll be good	uh when i was in high school we had a choice of uh taking	0
user:okay|agent:[noise] well i'm trying build up my tolerance now i jus[t]- surgery um less than two months ago and right now i'm just a little over about a mile and a half but i tr[y]- try to workup to three miles|user:how far about how far do you go walking	yeah that's good	0
agent:no i- i just do it on TV i have a cassette|user:um-hum [noise] do you go to an aerobics class or do you watch on TV|agent:yeah it is and it this has an you know my treadmill has an incline and you know you can get a really good workout on it [noise]	okay which uh shows do you watch on TV	1
user:yeah every morning|agent:do they are the[y]- yeah ok[ay]- they're so they're still he's still doing it then huh oh i'll have to tune in [laughter]|user:yeah well they they do low impact stuff now they're on everyday	it's on ESPN	0
agent:i'll have to|user:Monday through Friday|user:they're on weekdays at eleven o'clock everyday	case you're interested in that	1
user:for example uh when things are going good i think the voter turnout is less just because people|user:um|user:um	figure why bother you know what's the difference especially when two candidates seem roughly equal	1
user:but they also had very low voter turnouts especially_1 like in the Hispanic community|user:the way that it didn't go|user:and there were a lot of of minorities that wanted it to go	and i think in that case they've just they developed a distrust of the system	0
user:in uh|user:being a citizen not not serving on jury duty is important enough to them_1 that they don't want to have any say|user:not	politics	1
user:what the responsibilities of the judges were i didn't know anything about the individuals who's names were on the ballet|user:i mean i didn't know anything about any of these races i didn't know|user:and	and i'm going you know how can i possibly make an informed choice here	1
user:i'd i'd say|agent:deal with some of the issues lets say that T[exas]- uh Texas State uh Railroad Commission has to solve when you don't even fathom what the implications are of they're decision so who would you care who got in that position you know|agent:uh and it's pretty difficult to	yeah i'd say there's a large number especially of urban	0
user:[laughter]|agent:that's probably well worth it then it probably be worth it just to do away with the cost of the elections and uh put it in the hands of maybe one man who can|user:but it also means you've got a unified state government you don't have different departments pulling against each other	yeah	1
user:it w[as]- it was uh a minor inconvenience it was certainly|user:what i waited maybe ten minutes in line|user:uh the the line	worth it to me i think	1
agent:and i would just assume in holding still|user:um-hum|agent:and i've got to remember uh you know on this election i'm in this district in this election i'm for here and uh you know this precinct votes here	yeah	1
user:what is the duties of this political office and uh|user:as far as you know what|agent:um-hum	and what are the characteristics or wh[at]- what are the	1
user:better informed decisions|user:and it explained a lot to me about the individual candidates and helped me make a lot of|user:that covered the major races	but still uh	1
agent:with so many elected officials i guess there's just so many people to go around [laughter] in some of those cases|agent:that's true|user:that sort of attitude	yeah	1
user:i ju[st]- i just feel like|user:well|agent:so i how do you feel that it should be applied	there's a lot of murderers and rapists and everything else just walking the streets	0
agent:and it's|user:that's right that's honestly right|agent:how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars	they have really got it better than we do in a lot of ways	1
agent:and then turn around in thirty years that you know and less they're out|user:uh-huh|agent:you know they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's you know that it's going to you know that should be life but instead in in given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life they'll give them ninety years in prison or something	uh-huh	1
user:same thing yes|user:i- i know yeah|user:but it's	yes	1
agent:you know|agent:the penalty didn't go back|agent:and then they reinstated it later but	uh-huh	1
user:but uh|user:i live in a small place you know|agent:we could go around and boy	[noise] even the small towns now though has really changed from when i was a kid but now i'm raising children	0
agent:well December seventy two was when uh we bombed North Vietnam and and they released the prisoners in early seventy three so that that time frame|user:i was born in sixty two so when did it end|agent:yeah uh	yeah	1
agent:uh or or Dallas i- i think if we see it you know we see John Wiley W[iley]- Price|agent:and this is what i find particularly difficult in that uh if we see injustice and whether it's in a uh you know Chicago or|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
user:i don't know for me i don't know you know i can't say that i agree with Vietnam because|user:you know how can you know the Bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you and it's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind so it's like how can you|user:and i know other Christians would disagree with me my husband and i are kind of not even in agreement on this but we don't fight over it or anything but	how can you be gentle unto all men and	0
user:then he'd open and then he dropped dead twenty five years premature he just dropped dead|user:and that now he build roads so|agent:but	and so something good did come out of that in that	0
agent:that appeared to be eight or nine years old and and the people looked like children i mean you couldn't imagine that one would would would conceal a bomb and|agent:in the unit i was commander of|agent:we couldn't uh we had uh we had a a young lady that was fourteen that worked in our	um-hum	1
agent:and that that you know and you i think that's one of those things when we get to Heaven we're going to ask God [laughter]|agent:and|user:right they left a woman and a child or the cat the sheep yeah	i know	1
agent:well and i- i and even at the even at the local level when somebody's assaulted what do you do turn the other cheek|user:the best way to do it you know but the thing is is that then God gets the glory not a president not a king and i think that's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory|user:it'd look absolutely ridiculously stupid but it would work out because if you follow the scriptural principals it's going to work out because_1 those are that's	um-hum	1
user:national identity and i'm an American and having different nations and all of this|user:i- [vocalized-noise] i don't have a problem with uh|user:means that i am not for one world government i'm not for all these new age things	but i am concerned about the killing that went on there because i just feel like God has a better way to handle it	1
agent:oh|user:and uh there's a lot of problems with that|agent:um	a lot of debate going on with that	1
user:yeah|agent:oh yeah they there they pay them a little better here i think than most than than than than the national average especially these mentor teachers|user:uh not no not too well	yeah	1
agent:lacking in some very specific areas|agent:i also i mean in general i think that our educational system is okay but i think we're|agent:it it it's being done	yeah	1
user:you know it's|user:uh|agent:um-hum	if some if a teacher	0
agent:metal detector and and uh outside the school or something|agent:[laughter] do that means you have to have a|agent:sure up you know in or educational system maybe	yeah	0
agent:i think a lot of kids are having a problem with that today|agent:a wise idea just to give kids more of an authoritarian sort of view|agent:in school but i think some things might be a	yeah	1
user:we've like i say we've been redistricting here in Dallas has been a|user:but uh|user:right	a	0
agent:well i hope it all works out|user:it it's just a big battle|user:and uh	but uh	1
agent:um whatever kids we have want to go to school wherever i teach|agent:and my and my only hope is that|user:yeah	yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:well they give some some financial aid for education they they advertise that they give it you can earn up to ten or twenty thousand dollars for|user:after service	but uh that's how i got m[y]- my education such as it was was going into it is service and then	0
agent:um-hum|user:a tax on food that we purchased at the grocery store and things and all of that was new to me so [noise]|user:wh[en]- when we came back to Texas i i was really kind of excited there wasn't a state income tax and there wasn't	i'm sort of	0
user:i mean i i don't enjoy paying taxes|user:[noise] but i think|user:a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your gro[ceries]- groceries and	and it's hard but um	1
agent:it's the people that can really influence the government and have all the money to [laughter] [noise]|user:and um that makes you feel bad|agent:yeah i thi[nk]- yeah	right and you know when um	0
agent:no|user:and that's not fair|user:are living pretty pretty good life styles but they're not paying income tax	to me and there's you know some people who uh are abusing	1
agent:well yeah i agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get and|user:how do you feel|user:and um i'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services i enjoy	um-hum	1
agent:i can understand maybe why the rich people don't want to pay|agent:so but you know i think if|user:yes	um-hum	1
user:and so i think you know in that way we're compensated|agent:yeah|user:have to pay taxes on it	um just by our society yet you know	0
agent:yeah|user:in that even if they made that kind of money there's some countries that have like fifty percent income tax you know that have socialized medicines and things and|agent:yeah	that they um	1
user:because um you know that we've had enough industry here that i guess it|user:not having the state income tax and i hope that|user:i like Texas um	is that why we don't [laughter] the industry here is able to	0
user:enough money it was really nice that they had uh|user:the city had it's|user:um there's enough i know we moved here from Houston and um	but they began to cut back because of the oil problems but um you know they would ha[ve]- have um so many community outdoor theaters and	0
user:my parents pay in Missouri|user:the property tax that we pay and everything is so much higher than|user:yeah it's true and i'm you know like the	but um	0
agent:um-hum|user:i'd much rather live here and pay taxes than live somewhere else and|user:here in this country and having seen other countries	and not	1
agent:well|user:uh uh but but right this moment you probably have several loans out or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something|agent:um-hum	master charge	1
agent:um-hum|agent:i know|user:what a a week i think we here at TI get a total of eleven a year	and that's about uh three or four less than	0
agent:to give a country money to help them fine but i don't feel we should be loaning money like that i mean it doesn't work are they gonna|agent:i don't i don't feel we should loan them money if i- i wish our leaders were really seeking the Lord on these things and if we feel led|user:how do you feel about that	well in so many cases it's not a loan it's just a g[ive]- a giveaway	1
agent:um-hum|user:asking for trouble people are too different|user:uh that's	i mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the US and find	0
agent:yeah i know what you're saying|user:a [vocalized-noise] well yes yeah but uh|agent:ethnic groups [laughter]	my grandfather came over from Lithuania back uh just before the turn of the century	1

user:right|user:as health|agent:but uh dental insurance is important to me it is not as important as uh as health insurance you know if i had to rank them	so uh for a health insurance what do you think would be a uh a good health insurance with a a low deductible and a high premium or do you prefer the lower premiums with a higher deductible	1
agent:but i would really check that out because_1 i'm concerned in coming years it's going to be you know just a horrendous burden to especially the younger folks|user:um-hum|agent:i see well it will become even more important you know when and if you do	what i'm really scared about and you know i'm i don't know firsthand but i it seems to me that	0
user:i guess i'll uh|agent:same to you [vocalized-noise]|user:well it's been nice talking to you	maybe see you again sometime	1

agent:so it i don't know whether it would be wiser to have an educated judge even though he may get uh out of touch after a while or whether it would be uh worth it to stick to the|agent:counties|user:yeah true	yeah	1
agent:i guess it's too frustrating [laughter]|user:yeah|agent:technical and those who you know friends i have are usually we discuss technical items and we don't uh try to follow the world's problems	yeah it does	1
user:it's it's hard to to know anymore if it's uh a threat one way or another because|user:right|agent:you know not what they used to be uh [laughter] [vocalized-noise]	uh it used to be s[o]- so [vocalized-noise] much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell you know rank and file in behind it	0

user:we are paying a lot in taxes|user:but anyway i- i think that um|agent:okay	but i think that	1
user:i uh i think they need to manage it a little bit better but|user:um the you know all the things that the government does like that|user:um the hospital stuff that the the government gives money to	i don't think uh	1
user:[noise] [laughter] yeah|agent:yeah ours is seven point seven five [laughter-almost] eight and it drives me crazy i'm thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about we don't want a state income tax but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they don't do anything about it|user:or seven point something	um-hum	0
user:yeah|agent:you just you just managed to escape the real Texan accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there|user:uh it's i don't know rural an urban area i guess whatever i don't know what i'm	no no i've just lived here	1

user:know exactly who needs that money and who doesn't need that money|user:welfare dollar needs to come back t[o]- to the local levels because the local people|user:i think the management of the	when it's directed from afar	0
user:i think that's wonderful when do we first when do we then start giving them their lifetime income|user:um-hum|agent:i think by limiting the number of consecutive terms a congressman or senator can hold whether it be a state congressman or senator or at the national level limiting the two terms and then they've got to sit out one	as a retired politician	1
user:it they don't they speak with fork and tongue don't [laughter-they]|agent:that don't want to increase taxes and they don't want to do this but every year they vote themselves in a very healthy pay raise|agent:and they're the ones that have screamed so mu[ch]- m[uch]- much about	at least we're in agreement on that aren't we [laughter]	1
user:uh i heard uh someone uh supposedly an authority say[ing]- speaking on TV saying that|agent:well in the form of capitalism that we've got apparently that's not working real good either|user:we know communism doesn't work what do we do next	the interest rate as we have known it in the past will never be the	0
user:because of the kickbacks and et cetera|user:are so protecting what they have in the budget that it doesn't seem to work that every man has to pay his own fair share and maybe that's why corporate America gets away with what they're doing|user:i think that the lobbyist uh	i'm a bit of a a pessimist i don't see a change in my lifetime i'm afraid	1
agent:okay nice talking to you bye|user:absolutely [laughter] nice talking to you|agent:it is the best system that's out there right now but it does need some fine tuning at this point	bye	0

agent:and people living just really close to it i mean|agent:that there would be houses|user:huh-uh	yeah	1
user:but once they get started|agent:um-hum|user:to begin with apparently it does cost more	it's really it saves them money in the end	0
user:the money and the income that they're going to make off of this is|user:they're making fantastic amounts of money on these things and uh even the the incinerators|agent:yes	you know just astronomical	1
agent:huh-uh|user:[laughter] no you're young you have a lot of life yet and and these we have some people who say well this isn't going to affect me this air pollution uh older people or|agent:[laughter] seems kind of old to me [laughter]	they think they're far enough away from something	0

user:while i'm getting ready to go to work|user:wake up to it in the morning this is my i guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning|user:i uh	oh i	1
user:[vocalized-noise] uh my personal opinion is that the uh the various network news [vocalized-noise] medias were uh|user:well that's true but uh i|agent:uh the casualties were differently the amount of missiles launched were different and it was almost too much information over-communicated	trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military	1
agent:[vocalized-noise]|agent:yeah|user:and i check that everyday	and of course with that goes along the the stock price of TI	1
user:uh i mean there there are times where uh|agent:hm|user:and i know what it takes to get some of those little bits a[nd]- of bits and pieces of news on the air	vide[o]- uh reporter actually will risk is life	0

agent:[laughter]|user:and they suggested that i come out that mine was the only tent that hadn't fallen down yet and sure enough after i got out of there a little bit it blew down and|user:i'm doing all right and	the winds were just terrible and uh	1
agent:think gee i survived that [laughter] we'll always need the uh feather bed as it were|user:yeah that's for sure|agent:we can laugh about it i mean your not laughing about it then [laughter-too] [laughter-much] you know i mean you know afterwards it's it's it's kind of a nice memory to	yep	1
agent:yeah yeah sure|user:i was trying to think what the last movie that we went to see was probably Russia House with uh Sean Connery|user:uh so we see uh the ones that have been out for a while	and uh	0
agent:baby in the house and and and she just turned a year old so it just kind of put the clamp on things um|agent:well i love it we uh got a new|user:uh so you so then you're not a uh uh not a frequent movie goer either	oh yeah	1
user:but|agent:yeah and some of them that turned to flops we saw other other other night we saw um Lady in Red|user:yeah that's that's a little bit too much so	um-hum	1
user:and|agent:um-hum|user:four to six of those on a weekend	you know two weekends three weekends out of four maybe two or th[ree]- two out of three or three out of four there won't be anything that we want to go see	0
agent:ooh my it's got to be something fun yeah you don't have to think yeah sure|user:i don't know had a had a lot of hidden meanings in it i suppose but uh|agent:kind of drab	you know	0
user:um|agent:great|user:before so i- i- i thought it was a real good movie	i enjoyed the book	0
agent:and well i think the|user:but uh|agent:um-hum	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:you have to follow a hidden plot|agent:and there is nothing worse than going to see a movie where|user:[laughter]	yeah	1
user:well|agent:so wh[at's]- what's your prediction on North Carolina and Duke|user:yep	i don't know about_1 North Carolina but	0
agent:yeah big time|user:they beat Duke's [vocalized-noise] ass last year|user:[laughter]	[laughter] yeah	1
agent:of course the oth[er]- they got Sam Perkins|agent:yeah he's good coming off the bench now|agent:yeah	um-hum	1
user:well he made it|user:huh|agent:he took the shot if he makes it he's a hero if he misses it he's a goat he made it	[noise]	1

agent:bye-bye|user:all right you too thanks bye|agent:God bless and you have a good day now	[noise]	1
agent:um-hum|user:you know how do you enforce it or what if they are just totally against it then does it really|user:but on the other hand	benefit anybody you know	1
user:well and probably too even those who|user:yeah yeah|agent:and i mean i i even think that that sort of experience is worth a lot more than reading a textbook sometimes	might initially be opposed	0
user:that's tough|agent:i- i i know i mean i wish i was lucky enough to not want to work [laughter] you know [laughter]|user:yeah i don't understand that either that's	[laughter]	1
agent:yeah|user:you know get off on some other track but|agent:um-hum	you know it's hard to say	1
user:yeah|agent:bad in some other way|agent:or you know because they were	but i guess that's not a terrible alternative if you've	0
agent:how you doing|user:hi Phil	pretty good how many children did you say you had	1
agent:yeah|user:uh i was attending school|agent:ouch	and then i found myself short of cash so i uh also went in for a part-time job so by the time that i got home after my second job	0
user:well i can think of of some enjoyable things that that i did with the kids like we used to go up to uh New Hampshire quite a bit and go to the uh|agent:uh things i would like to have done differently on uh on the kids though|agent:i can think of a uh	uh the White Mountains area and and visit all the you know the nature trails and things like that	0
agent:uh i personally don't believe i did no for one reason being like i mentioned i was in retail when she was younger|user:did you spend as much time with your daughter as you did with your sons|agent:and uh pick them_1 up and carry them_1 there and that kind of thing	uh-huh	1
user:but it seems like whenever i wanted to do something like go out [noise] for the kids and uh|user:uh playing someplace|user:um i spent a lot of time with her when i was home uh she'd always be the one you know sitting on my lap or being close to me and the two guys would be off uh	she'd always say well i want to go to my girlfriend's house or i want to stay home and do this or she had like little projects she was working on at home and things like that	1
user:and uh|user:i remember when i first took my kids out uh fishing and again i was with my two sons and not with my daughter but uh no i was with my oldest son uh my youngest son wasn't old enough or i didn't think he was old enough to take out|agent:he's gotten now to where he can take it better he'll dish it back a little bit but [laughter]	uh we caught this fish it was uh it was a fairly large size fish and he was very very proud it of he put it on the backseat on the floor and it was waggling around and	0
user:well um|agent:how do they pay for it how is it financed|user:done and accepted	i think the government subsidizes most of it but i- i believe that that again just people are taxed	0
user:um-hum|agent:and you know even though the insurance is paying eighty percent of it you're pay an arm and a leg for the insurance first of all and then you're still paying yeah the twenty percent and so|user:um-hum	the twenty percent	1
agent:i've been fortunate enough not to but i mean you could go down there half dead and sti[ll]- wait you know it's hard to see a doctor from what i've heard|user:um-hum|agent:their free hospitals or whatever and i know a few people that have had experiences in those	oh i know i know oh yeah it's true	1
agent:where my medical where it was worth it to itemize for medical expenses because they were just they were that much of a percentage of my income that it just|user:oh you did|user:um-hum	wow	1
agent:that's something that's something fairly new and not a lot of people take advantage of it but it's you know it's use it or lose it and [laughter-i]|agent:you know|user:yes	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:i definitely agree and i remember back in high school being on the debate team and|user:you know i mean just something that should be more of a priority than it is now|agent:yeah	yeah	1
user:um-hum|agent:have to be headed in that direction|user:um-hum	well it was nice talking to you	0
user:and the other one is Night Court|agent:okay|user:um one of them's Quantum Leap	and i think i think they're real different i mean i don't think they have anything in common uh	0
user:yeah that's right|user:he is [laughter]|agent:Dan Fielding was just too too vulgar and too crude for me [laughter] and and i told my husband that's the whole point but [laughter] i i just it's	i mean	1
agent:the one that got killed|agent:and um so uh and then the the blonde that they took out|user:yeah i agree	yeah i can't remember what her name is but uh	1
user:you know you kind of|agent:um-hum|user:uh it seemed like it was almost two different organizations you know like like Hunter was the boss and and this other girl was not and	you're wondering you know well when did this happen you know	0
agent:just go ahead and|agent:yeah|user:you know you always kind of sit there and you see these two people together and you always wonder why they don't you know get together or whatever and so i guess that's what they decide to do	yeah	1
agent:i didn't|agent:yeah|user:and that was i mean that was the killer the series died right after that	because	0
user:she had been at the beginning the the intelligent one the the one who ev[eryone]- always solved the things and and figured out and kept|agent:um-hum|user:um well like i said this one about uh Max or Get Well Smart uh the female character uh Barbara Feldon	Max from getting real messed up	0
user:yeah the well i yeah i hardly ever watch it but uh as as i've seen it|agent:i've seen it before but i don't watch it regularly usually Tuesday nights i'm out so|user:it's uh that's on Tuesday nights i think	they've they've done sort of the same thing to where they've they started to let them_1 get together and then they pulled them_1 apart	0
user:uh their marriage was so highly publicized|agent:um-hum|user:now like Madonna and Sean Penn now i don't particularly like either one of them_1 but um	that there was no way that they could stay together	0
agent:yeah i think we've covered our time it's been good talking to you [laughter]|user:well i gue[ss]- i guess that's about all we need to do isn't it|user:so um	[laughter] yeah it has Becky i really appreciate it	1
agent:yeah|user:it was extraordinary yeah we um um and then you know couldn't wait for the newspaper reminded me of when i was younger the uh|agent:yeah C N N coverage was really good	the time of Watergate and just couldn't get enough of it	1
user:that what was it|user:it did yeah it was like you know|agent:yeah after a while though it started getting a little repetitive it ran out of news [vocalized-noise]	two steps forward one step back [vocalized-noise]	0
user:um and we pick up a local paper we're really|user:yeah that's funny because every once in a while if my husband and i have traveled or something|agent:oh it's it's it's not even a [laughter-comparison]	shocked even in a major city	0
agent:yeah|user:the i think the only time we only really watched the news and this tells you how old i was was during the Cuban missile crisis|user:yeah yeah no i can remember way back back in those days when i was in school	uh i we could just we were all centered around that television	0
agent:little too much maybe|user:yeah yeah|user:uh-huh	does it does it bother you that uh at this point in your life that you're not getting more	0
agent:it's a little near sighted but uh|user:yeah|agent:yeah you shouldn't even worry about most of the stuff i mean i don't know	but	1
user:yeah that would seem like that would be uh more expensive than a uh|user:yeah|agent:you know because_1 she would be sleeping so i would be here then	n[ursing]- nursing home wouldn't it	1
user:well seems to me if a person gets into that area|agent:and it just depends on how bad that person is|user:yeah	they i- i don't know it seems like if you're going to get in that area and spend the time learning it because you do have to go to school on some of it	0

user:yeah|agent:yeah that's [vocalized-noise] matter fact that's one of my favorite hobbies is uh reading|agent:[laughter-oh] [laughter-yeah]	i'm that's one of mine my husband's a little more inclined toward that but i'm not real uh interested in self-improvement books at all i think everything's too topical nowadays	1
agent:he writes the uh [vocalized-noise] action series|user:um-hum|agent:he's uh i read those uh actually i think my favorite author really right now is uh William Johnstone	um-hum i've heard again i'm not familiar with reading him but i've heard of him	1
user:and|user:that's exactly what happened to us we were living um in Minneapolis at the time and we were getting ready to come back to Texas um|agent:yeah we got at TI to drive into town and almost buy it undercover at the time they were doing it	i went i mean into a Waldon's and stood in line for like six hours it seemed like	0

user:anything to be real interesting yeah well it's good to talk to somebody i don't read as much as i used to um|agent:neophyte|agent:there was just too much detail there for the for the	my husband's a TIer and i'm in journalism so i do a lot of writing um during the normal course of my job and it's kind of um	0
agent:it's uh it fluctuates you kind of get uh fl[ashbacks]- you get some flashbacks but you can really tell it's a flashback because the print goes to italic|user:does he tell it in narrative form or in third person how does he present it|agent:he's heavy into Japanese culture uh along with uh the Ninja the arts of Ninja and uh all all the various uh martial arts	uh-huh	1
user:um-hum|agent:uh you'll then you'll like O'Leary he's he's he's quite good at it i've got into one that i didn't think i would it's a i'm not it's a kind of a historical Indian novel thing by Donald Colesmith|user:no that's more no that's not i do actually i like Asian cultures [vocalized-noise] that why i was that's funny that you mentioned that	um-hum	1
user:[noise]	do you believe in uh capital punishment	1
user:uh|agent:yeah|user:well you've got [laughter] a moral problem and an economic one	when when she's going to be in prison for the rest of her life with no chance of parole ah what good does it do anybody	0
user:and i think kidnapping could carry death penalty as well|user:uh murder|user:if well uh i thi[nk]- i think it's it's only uh it only applies to ce[rtain]- a very few types of crimes	i'm not sure what ho[w]- what the range is for uh for the crimes that uh would merit a death penalty	1
agent:yeah|user:it's it's a real moral dilemma|user:to the rest of uh the population or or you can put them_1 out of everybody's misery uh i don't know	i mean i come from the Catholic church and [laughter] they they uh are definitely opposed	1
agent:he's basically was amoral|agent:and even interviews with his mother she said that you know f[or]- f[or]- as a small child|agent:you know it sounds like the guy had about every turn given to him every rehab opportunity given to him	right	1
agent:have you ever sat on a jury|user:right well [laughter] it's it's it's real small but uh like i said i mean the death penalty could probably be justified if if the evidence|agent:and then what do you do about the the thing that you know the the the was it one tenth of one percent chance that they might have been convicted erroneously	if there's no doubt no i never have	1
agent:what they did is they usually hired kids to do this because you uh would get a you know a lighter sentence or no sentence or probation or you know something trivial|agent:and you'd go to court and you'd see these kids and then an[d]-|user:yeah	right	1
agent:you know abducting the the young girls i don't think i'd even hesitate|agent:who's been uh|agent:boy if they ever catch this guy in in Richardson and Coppell	right	1
user:w[ell]-|agent:even if they you know claim that they're are rehabbed|user:sure	yeah they don't have any really useful job skills uh lots of places	0
user:people have to uh stand up and uh denounce him again|user:and uh|user:his case comes up every few years now i guess	and claim that he's not fit for society	1
agent:uh-huh|user:the gardens are kind of old you have to step down in them_1 now that the|user:um	and we've tilled them_1 so much but they're still	1
agent:guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people uh|agent:it sounded well|agent:yeah i guess i was having a hard time there too i thought	yeah	1
agent:oh really is because_1 of like the cross pollination or|user:beans like to be near certain types of plants now they they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like uh peas i don't know|user:she plans it all out	something	1
agent:um either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something|user:oh|agent:no it's just the like the bees and insects will do it	i know	1
agent:do anything i mean|agent:creosote would|agent:i've [vocalized-noise] seen a lot of people use them_1 you know for flowerbeds but i don't know what whether they'd have	yeah i don't i don't i just don't think you i always thought i'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird	0
agent:yeah|agent:oh geez|user:said yep that's one thing you have to do summer keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding and i'm looking at him like jeez people would kill to have a lilac bush	and he's cutting it down [laughter] so	0
user:so|agent:yeah because_1 it like i- i think i've seen those before but i don't remember what they look like|user:if if the trees hang down so low and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns [laughter-on] [laughter-it]	they're a pretty tree but you just when you walk up to them_1 they're covered with thorns so we're going to get a chain saw and we're going to limb limb it extensively so	0
agent:and that uh|user:um-hum|agent:it's really good that we did well	[noise]	1
agent:right|user:the new world order|user:and uh his motivations are i don't feel like he was absolutely on the up and up with us on you know the mot[ivation]- the true motivation he talks a lot about	and most Americans probably don't really know what that would mean and i maybe i'm being maybe i'm assuming too m[uch]- no i don't think most would i really don't	0
user:and he did talk about that though he did uh he at least he did mention it you know what i'm saying|agent:right|user:i don't know everything i don't mu[ch]- you could watch news all the time but you don't know anything hardly	i don't think most people understand what he's talking about when he talks about that new world order	0
user:um-hum|agent:during the whole war he never put out like a c[onservation]- a conservation effort for oil|user:uh-huh	but the motivation though see wasn't didn't have anything i don't believe it had anything to do with the oil	0
user:i guess that's what i feel happen with the war and that was the motive of the war was to try and break that up and so that they could be|user:that's just a real good thing but i think it's something that's going to happen but|user:i just don't see that um	you know	0
user:that you know hey i'm going to pray about it and [laughter] if i feel led to|user:i don't know just i mean i would pr[obably]- most people probably think i don't even have a high school education you know because of my attitude about it but i just feel like there's so much going on|agent:[laughter]	vote for a certain person i'm [laughter-going] to do it but i'm not going to get all up tight about all this	0
agent:[laughter]|user:it was like kind of s[ad]- it was like man this is really hard you know i want to watch the war|user:and so it was you know we just went from one extreme to the other you know and	and so [laughter]	0
user:but any[way]- yeah it's been interesting though all these different people and some of them_1 are real friendly you know and it's like yeah man when i come to Dallas i'll call you you know and then others of them_1 are like they just wanna go but then some of them_1 have babies crying in the background too so|agent:yeah yeah|user:i know i talked to some guy who was i talked to some of the yuppie types you know and they're pretty interesting but yeah they're real opinionated but i guess that's better than nothing you know	there may be other reason than	0
user:yep anyway is that funny but we did talk about fishing though so|user:so i was just [laughter-going] wait a minute we're supposed to be talking about fishing now stop but|user:[laughter] how much [laughter-do] [laughter-you] make up in Rhode Island	but i guess i'll let you go i'm going to finish my dishes and if anything happens interesting in the war maybe they'll have another thing and we'll get you again	0
agent:in the city and|agent:and the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is Hispanic uh gang crime|agent:uh individuals that live there and then there's a very large Hispanic population there	oh	1
agent:uh|agent:uh-huh|user:that they have all these after school activities for kids they set up kids with elderly people in the winter time they shovel their snow they have a big brother big sister program they have bottle drives they have cleanup outings	and they have also organized fun activities like gyms going to the beach and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer	0
agent:uh-huh|user:they don't care about anybody|user:it's not	these people they're stealing from they're just the big bad rich guy	0
agent:yeah|agent:uh-huh|user:i'm glad i don't live in a big city	just because	1

user:medical|user:pretty basic uh|user:organization um so my benefits are	um	0
user:uh|user:where you have more control and allocate uh like you can|user:you know flex flexible benefits	pay for	0
user:objectives|agent:well people with families have different objectives than single people or|user:individual needs which i think is the most important thing because everybody is got quite a few different	yeah are you single	1
agent:so|agent:i'm with a smaller company though|agent:and it costs a lot more	the but the medical stuff itself uh	0
user:uh coverage uh|agent:um-hum|user:well i think uh obviously i think the the medical is the most expensive or it's the most important	of the you know you may not even go in	1
agent:i'm not exactly sure|user:yeah|agent:or maybe it's fifty percent up to eighty percent	but that that's a nice i think that's an important benefit	0
user:[laughter]|agent:you know about insurance [laughter] i didn't know anything about insurance until i had got [laughter-until] [laughter-i] [laughter-had] [laughter-children]|agent:yeah yeah that's what it is	i i the only reason i know a little bit about that is	0
agent:really|user:losing money or not doing as well as they could|user:people are losing you know and it	and uh	1
user:was you know there's fairly big dis[crepancies]- discrepancies you know|agent:uh-huh|user:uh what your benefits would be and uh the difference between you know the the term life with annuity and the whole life	so they could try to replace those	0
agent:until you get your dependents it just doesn't matter|user:i'm not worried about that i don't have anybody to|user:but uh	to	0
user:uh you know|user:you know that's fine but uh|user:and	to get that coverage and know that i'll get	0
user:a profit sharing is is uh|user:what else is im[portant]- important uh obviously i think uh|user:but uh anyway as far as benefits um	is a	0

agent:well uh i recommend it because you just walk right on in and there's usually not anybody in line|agent:uh-huh|user:gone so i i did it but uh it was nice i would be tempted to do it again	right	1
agent:have the ti[me]- find the time also to r[ead]- read about the guy and and be able to find the information about what he stands for|agent:r[ight]- right but it gets to the point where i mean you've got to|user:no i guess it'd be best if you knew what each person and [laughter] what they stood for and why and everything but	right and try to determine if what you read was objective or not and	1
agent:well i enjoyed talking to you|user:really about the polls or voting|agent:and	to talk about well it was good talking to you um bye	1
agent:and and what we've proven to ourselves what we prove to ourselves every month is that we're spending more than than we make [laughter] so it's it's kind of depressing to see it in black and white but uh yeah|agent:um|user:[laughter]	yeah	1
agent:yeah uh-huh but we look at it sort of as an investment in the future too you know i'm going back to school my wife's going back to school too our lifestyle right now|user:which is easy to do|agent:uh but	[laughter]	1

user:uh but to me|user:Dallas or Chicago or even Indianapolis which is a couple hours south of us|user:so the setting is very different than it would be in	the	1
agent:um-hum|user:isn't that the way with most groups though they become a self-protection thing|user:uh-huh	uh of saving jobs or getting more salary	0
user:uh-huh|agent:yeah that's in in small communities that's a difficult choice but then the small communities are the ones with fewer problems|user:except we don't have another school	because they have fewer students	1

user:uh when i applied my foot on the brakes and i i been experiencing this squeak for quite a while|user:in fact it was about a year ago|user:so i started taking my car to the garage and uh i had a little squeak	so i stopped at one of these speedy muffler places uh	1
user:slightest idea i needed brakes|user:i said well jeez you know i only stopped here to get a wheel bearing put in and i says i didn't uh you know i didn't have uh|user:so then he says uh-huh you need you need brakes on the front you need brakes on the back	so he says well	1
agent:yes|user:but what what they've got now is like a little metal tab|user:yeah this is evidently it's a new technology that uh that came about after i worked in my garage twenty years ago they didn't have such a thing	that uh that that that is designed to squeak	0
user:i don't have all the right tools and it ends up taking my twice as long|user:and i was going to do it myself and i just you know it it i shuddered uh because_1 everytime i try to work on my car l[ately]- lately|user:so he says well why do you want to put it all back together again if you know you need brakes because_1 he showed me and i did in fact need brakes	so then he turned around and says i can give you a fifteen or ten percent discount if you do it now so i says okay so it ended up costing me almost six hundred almost seven hundred dollars	0
user:and the part came to i don't know twenty seven dollars and the labor came to s[omething]-|user:picked up the car when it was all done and i says well how much is it|user:so i uh i went down i picked it up	something like fifteen dollars	0

user:was|user:uh investments and of course uh oil|user:uh riskier	uh one of the main things that were invested in oil and real estate and of course when oi[l]- when oil went south real estate went with it	1
agent:the uh actions taken against their the little guy the depositor the customers|agent:i feel pretty strongly about this and that's i think they're over reacting as far as the|agent:handling it i uh	yeah	0
user:i'm not sure which which one is which|user:it's either going to be repaid or just completely blown off|agent:yeah	i- i really think our whole financial institution is a house of cards waiting to collapse	1
agent:out in the open it's uh you know behind the scenes kind of uh|agent:uh not|agent:if they're doing anything it's still pretty much uh	right	0
agent:one time it was i think ten minutes was the maximum and another time it was uh|agent:yeah i think uh|user:oh uh do they come on does something body come on the line and tell you to do that	oh	1

agent:more programs going so that you could do that it'd make it a lot easier so|agent:i think if you know the cities locally you know they'd get|user:yeah it sure is	yeah	1
agent:that's right so|agent:so you don't|user:yeah they do and you know the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get that's for sure	so	1
agent:i- i make so much money here at TI that that we just spend it and we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck it's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semiconductor firm you can just spend it well|user:well|agent:no i just	[laughter]	1
user:um-hum|agent:these kind of things are about a hundred dollars a year so yo[u]- you know these are all equivalent to the monthly budget things some of them_1 are there to pacify situations and some of them_1 are there to prevent things from happening|agent:um car insurance in case you run into a lawyer and you break his arm he's going to sue the pants off of you	um-hum	1
user:you know just everything and having the responsibilities we've had on us for at such a young age|user:we you know we have a lot for to be our age and|agent:[laughter]	you know we have a like a nice house people you know are really shocked at how nice everything is in our house	0
agent:they take out for the for the finances the finance charge which is kind of|user:um-hum|agent:if you go up there and write them a two thousand dollar check it doesn't all go towards principal	um	1
agent:i think they even cover that because they want you|user:does she have to pay to have it refinanced|agent:and she's doing it i mean it's not like it's like	um-hum	1
user:but anyway instead of putting our foot down about it we just went okay whatever you know so anyway so next time we'll do that different we want to next time pay cash for our car too|agent:sure|agent:oh really	we want to pay cash for everything we can possibly do when we buy a house	0
user:right|agent:sev[en]- i'm sorry seven to nine years off the end of the loan and there are there is a local firm that'll actually if if like in my situation i don't have that because the loan was not available|user:right	um-hum	1
user:right|agent:X number of dollars off [vocalized-noise]|user:um-hum	yeah we real we've become aware of that we have a there's a loan officer through our church too that i think could help us better you know he does that full time with the bank you know	0
agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	so do you have any credit cards	1
agent:structure here|agent:you know credit card debt to our|agent:but we're trying our best not to not to add any	yeah um	1

agent:yeah|user:get it paid down|agent:yeah	and not use it for a while	1
user:okay uh|user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	let's see i i believe in the trial by jury i think if it was up to the judge alone that	0
user:theory i think that's|user:innocent until proven guilty|user:i r[eally]- i really agree with the uh	that's a good way to do it	1
agent:something like that for an extreme period of time|agent:that guy's going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or|user:yeah	right	1
user:is this open and shut you know like you were saying or|user:the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know how|user:you know those kinds of things and	do you need somebody to go off for three months and	0
agent:and let's you know let's get rid of some of this harassment suing|user:yeah right that|agent:either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case	right that's that's a good idea i in the Bible it says uh if you have something against somebody to go to them_1 first and if that doesn't work	0
user:you know the the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that it doesn't|user:true in a lot of our um|user:you know that whole Biblical concept like that that's	work on that but it's based out of that	1
agent:i know i did a Sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament where where there's a vengeful Lord in the Old Testament and there's a loving Lord in the New Testament but that's a whole different subject|user:yeah that's|agent:uh that's sort of the Old Testament version	[vocalized-noise]	1
user:okay|agent:well that's quite all right|user:oh okay in in Texas okay i was just being curious	yeah well i'm i'm from the Dallas area	0
user:like people just feeling that that their vote doesn't count anyway i mean why why bother voting if|user:yeah um i i suspect the apathy is is due to something|agent:the apathy exists i blame it to apathy	um if your vote won't make a difference so for instance in	0
agent:due to the overabundance of news we have available to us|user:that's true that's true|agent:and i i think the you hear the news you know you start out in the morning and all day you hear the news and by time say you get off work and go to vote you feel like it doesn't make any difference	um-hum that	1
user:um|user:so people think that that that they don't have|user:that well what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now and you know and stuff like that	that that it does[n't]- doesn't matter as much whereas i think it's probably just the opposite is true	0
user:that tha[t]- that portion of the population is massively under represented|user:you know and i think that's probably a portion of the population that's massively under represent[ed]- i i i would guess|user:i think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me i'm just a little nobody my vote's not going to count anyway	and	1
user:i mean that's that's what it what it boils down to is people like to s[ay]- you know|user:no i think|agent:that's a good point you're probably right	people say well i don't want to be on jury you know i don't want to serve on jury duty i don't want to vote i don't want to do this and that well then they could you know i	1
agent:gone the full circle|user:right|agent:total indifference you know what difference does it make back	now if things go the way that that that that they are there i think that they'll keep voting but	0
agent:y[eah]- yeah i thin[k]- well i know it's true you see a lot of that you know rally behind the female she may lose but by golly we're going to make a statement here|user:that's probably true|agent:oh and i think women turn out to vote for women too	yeah	1
user:say i i i would think that um|agent:i think i did vote for her as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure i did|user:and i i suspect she could get a large voter turnout	that that people like that i think in[flammatory]- inflammatory politicians are um	0
user:um-hum|agent:what the sto[ry]- the actual facts are at this point i don't i don't really know if some of the poor judges that are just trying to decide how it should be divided|user:yes	that's what	1
agent:sure|user:you don't want a judge to be appointed because you don't want someone's friend to be a judge|user:well in some sense they they should be politicians in that you know you want them to respect the people and you don't want them to have	but on the other hand	1
agent:oh|user:[laughter] so given a choice between you know so so if you have so if if imagine a world where you have two real candidates and one idiot who goes out and makes you know anti you know sort of um|user:so that a large population of of of voters will go out and vote against that person for someone else	anti women statements anti Semitic statements anti black statements et cetera et cetera well then i suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote for just just to spite that person [laughter]	0
user:yeah|agent:but like wh[en]- like when i'm down at home and like somebody says okay when are when are we having this you know and i'll and i'll cook it|user:uh-huh	oh that	1
agent:and then what you have is also like you know like three different kinds of salad|user:yeah|agent:and uh then we also put sausages on a bun and then that's that's to start out with	uh-huh	1

agent:okay|user:and chop some scallions and a little ginger|agent:okay	and just cover it with some uh waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done and it's a wonderful	0
user:and even grouper|agent:so we put soy sauce and sesame|user:sole or flounder is real good	little bit of soy sauce and sesa[me]- sesame seed oil	1
agent:how how much uh|agent:okay|user:just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce	that you can serve over rice	1
user:just stir that in and you've got a very colorful side|agent:okay|user:just stir fry the ground beef drain off the oil use the same hoi sin sauce and um some of the frozen mixed vegetables	another dish	1
agent:uh-huh|user:what they want to do|user:well first i think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to	uh once they have that then they can start looking in	0
agent:yeah what was your degree in|agent:yeah|user:[laughter] i didn't care about the program or anything else i went where i wanted to go	uh political science	1

agent:yeah it's i i think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful|agent:yeah|user:it's very much like that except worse	it is	0
agent:probably the biggest huh|user:what branch were you in|agent:i i think	what branch were you in	0
agent:[noise] yeah after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training you know it's it's something you know i think that's why you know children really need to|agent:washed out|user:[laughter] well that's	uh-huh	1

agent:that much better here a lot more sunshine and a lot less cold you know but i don't know about ever going that far south to live you know i guess you after a while whatever you get used to is what|agent:right right so uh yeah i i i like it better here i'm i'm uh formerly a Pennsylvanian and i have to say that i enjoy it|user:uh compared to what he's used to so	um-hum	1
agent:okay well nice talking to you|user:okay well|user:um-hum	it was yeah nice talking to you too um-hum bye-bye	1
user:it it so hit so close to home|user:it's strange because|user:so um	but um	0
user:uh maybe there's a bad uh a bad home in a rural area but it would be a very small one|user:um we don't have that problem up here we might maybe in a rural|agent:yeah	um the one my grandmother's in is very um hospital like there were some really nice ones here all the a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations	0
agent:uh-huh|user:so they couldn't they can't hide anything on you or anything like that|user:i mean i go up twice a week to see my grandmother and i know the staff very well	but i have heard of really awful conditions	0
user:and then uh the old Frenchman he'd get a little drunk look round at his kids oh you still need your mother i guess i'll look after her an[d]- and that what happens a lot when when people are|user:you know my neighbors across the street their uh mother was sick at times and they they couldn't handle her so they put her in a home|agent:his second wife as that hussy [laughter]	sick	0
user:when my father when something if anything happens to him|user:i don't really um|user:i have to put my foot down where where my life begins i mean if that was my mother i would really f[eel]- i feel a lot more responsible i would probably take care of my mother	i don't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i don't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home	0
user:so someone like that they i really don't want to see them go in a home he's got two li[ttle]- dogs that are his constant companions and he always replaces them|agent:[laughter]|user:the tow trucks got better there easier and he went out and bought himself a flat bed one so he won't have to do very much work an[d]-	you know i've had like over the past thirty years i've had you know about	0
user:precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home|user:if i brought all my|user:and i'm thinking when i get older i i i think	i- i don't want to be a s[elfish]- selfish you know a burden on anyone that's what i think because i see what my grandmother puts me through	0
user:that's the thing my grandmother really misses i mean really|agent:yeah|agent:uh-huh	growls about	1
agent:hence is possible error as you can see in all the ironsides|user:yeah i think that's true|agent:in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they're too easily swayed by their emotion	[laughter]	1
agent:although you still hear about those occasionally|user:right|agent:in jail	yeah	0
user:and|agent:uh-huh i did i did also|user:i thought that they all had to [laughter-agree] or else they it was a hung jury	yeah i thi[nk]- i don't know	0
agent:um-hum|user:yeah i think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street|agent:uh in as international law also	for something like that because of the cultural differences	0
agent:yes it's another war zone|user:i don't think so either In fact i think they end up worse because the conditions are so bad|agent:because uh inside the jail there i don't think there's no real rehabilitation it just	yeah	1
agent:i think so|user:well i think that covers it|agent:well good	it was nice talking to you	0

agent:mostly purebreds|user:um-hum|agent:but i had dogs primarily and uh	oh yeah	1
agent:sit outside my window and bay at the moon at night [laughter] and uh you know it's uh|agent:the only problem with it is that the bloody thing would|agent:so the winters would get fairly cold	[laughter]	1

agent:oh it's really horrible um i it got s[o]- Rochester gets so cold that sometimes i'll just have to wear like leggings until i get to work and take them off because it really really does get cold|user:i think i would be [laughter-wearing] [laughter] [vocalized-noise] pants|agent:um-hum	ye[ah]- yeah	1
agent:which is like adding another layer|agent:right|user:we have to dress extra light because we have to wear these smocks [laughter]	yeah and in the wintertime	0

agent:yeah and and it's so it's business so and you notice that they're they're only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old|user:and they make more money if you extend your loan|agent:well it's it's it's business and they're making money off that	yes	1
agent:oh i've never itemized yet|user:yeah on the uh there's there's there's a place for consumer debt and then you take ten percent of it on the|agent:i mean a mortgage i know you can	oh okay	0

user:uh technically it's two days but the[y]- the[y]- they took that check and scurried it to the bank and the bank scurried it back to my account and you thought there'd be just a little bit of float but apparently that's why the uh|user:you know almost well i guess it's the day after|user:my wife will write a check for groceries and	the uh the uh grocery stores are reluctant to do that because their volume	0
agent:on drugs while he was there|agent:you know because he was|agent:be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or	yeah	1
agent:in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything and tries and tries and tries|agent:but then you know it's kind of like a a lottery somebody|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:and it's b[ased]- based on on uh perception that someone has of how a drug user would behave when some drugs users behave|agent:uh-huh|user:it's an accusation and and it's	uh normal uh you know	1
agent:it's a legal job you know|user:i mean i- i|user:well it that doesn't i-	uh-huh	1

user:yeah i've heard that that's a really good way to get cars up here th[ey]- they only come around|agent:yeah one thing i like to do is is go to a police auction and get a car because_1 i've heard you can get pretty good deals but you have to be kind of patient because_1 you can't always just go in and get something right away l[ike]- l[ike]- like the Dallas Police Department has a car auction every Monday morning from like nine till twelve|user:so that saved them a lot of money	like once a year in the summertime they have a state auction but but they don't um	1
user:yep|agent:yeah but if you can get a good deal you know if you can save five thousand dollars five thousand dollars buys a lot of tires|user:and they didn't really know it it was a real nice late model car real pretty on the outside but they couldn't keep tires on it it kept eating the tires	i know a lot of people who've [boughten/bought] other cars the same way and and have done very well	1
agent:yeah that's right|user:and she was thinking of getting a Ford Taurus wagon she says they're not very pretty but like she was really impressed but i liked them a lot because they resembled the Saab when i got inside the door was big you know it wasn't it wasn't like a Volkswagen Rabbit|agent:yeah	you know i- i mean it had a full size door handle on it and it was the interior	0

user:yes [vocalized-noise]|agent:[noise] and yet [vocalized-noise] although he may never be free to kill again there are a lot of people like him that are free to kill again|agent:created or committed murders etcetera that have not been put to death even though they were sentenced to death row like like look at Charles Manson i mean he just happened to have the right timing	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:um-hum|user:the the way society uh has worked out there's some people that economically trapped|user:and it was talked about	and they really their parents don't bring them up properly they have absolutely no morals because_1 no one taught them	0

user:doing these conversations it makes me feel really bad that there are kids|user:i mean we're really fortunate to live here but|agent:um-hum	that	0
user:we sit up here on our pedestals judging but we're not there but it's just it is|agent:it you know we|agent:that just repulsed me and it repulsed everybody that i work with i mean	totally unheard of that you you you even think it would happen	1
user:okay|agent:uh somewhat they're not my favorite team but uh [laughter-yeah] i am uh somewhat familiar with them|user:[noise] uh i guess being here in Dallas are you familiar with the Rangers	[laughter]	1
user:uh they won't do anything until the all star break and then uh then they'll perk up a little bit and|user:shoot the Rangers i don't know what the there's no telling what they'll do they'll proba[bly]-|agent:yeah uh-huh	that seems to be their uh their average pace	0
user:yeah|agent:they can get a pretty good quality outfielder|user:right	when [vocalized-noise] they're going to have to spend some money and i think build up their pitching staff	0
agent:yeah|user:i don't know it's going to be interesting|user:and uh uh	uh my at work my boss got season tickets this year	0
user:right|agent:yeah and he hasn't really shown the the talent uh or the promise that they saw when he was at Oklahoma State|user:he stands out to be a a real leader	right sounds like they have a young guy that they're putting a lot of weight into	0
agent:Canseco's making five million a year|user:that's exactly right|user:go back	yeah and i i just don't see	0
agent:that's true they keep raising the ticket prices every year|agent:because baseball|user:exactly and you know ultimately the the consumer and the uh fan are the people that have to pay for it	through the	1
agent:yeah|user:you know making that much money|user:uh	and uh and then the the public you know just continues to you know help support and funnel the funds into	0
agent:oh i don't know how many weeks or months they said|agent:so he's out for at least uh|user:oh jeez	golly	1

agent:you know we need to have a roof over our head|agent:we take the rent first|agent:well	uh-huh	1
user:we both have married before|user:we do ours uh fairly similar course uh|agent:yeah	and uh so what what we do is kind of divide up the bills	0
user:yeah|agent:well that's better than having them living with you [laughter] they're more expensive right there day in and day out|user:which is after i mean that's net that's that's right after i pay the taxes and stuff on it	that's what i hear although although i kind of miss some of that stuff	1
agent:yeah|user:i was hanging onto it i thought God you know come Christmas time we're going to have that television set come hell or high water|user:and so all through the year i i was putting you know five or ten dollars back fifteen twenty whatever i could spare i was putting back in a little envelope in there	and sure enough we got it	1

user:that's the only bad part we got the same problem|agent:yeah|user:yeah they want their money real quick	however i guess it uh beats the alternative	1
agent:all right bye-bye|user:okay we'll check you later|agent:okay well it was nice talking to you	bye-bye	1
agent:and you could picture it as being Russia versus the US d[uring]- during the whole time|agent:right|user:uh-huh	right	1

agent:or or even have had the ability you know the chance to to go to college or to to to learn about it i think it's still good they do cover the system and i think it should still be taught in schools|user:sharpness and men[tal]- mental acuity|user:just aren't blessed with as as much	yeah	1
agent:we are uh w[e]- if not we may not be the top i don't know if we're the top we're one of the superpowers of the world|user:yeah|agent:you know that's fine and the rest of the world i mean	uh-huh	0

agent:i didn't think much i don't think much|user:she had no help she was alone with them|agent:pardon	[noise] oh that is hard	1
agent:you know from any kind of abuse or that kind of thing|user:yes|agent:that was a big factor for me that they would would be safe	yeah	0
agent:yeah|user:well you know i work eight to five thirty so what am i supposed to [laughter-do]|agent:oh gosh	so i well i had been sick and i it ended up that i didn't go to work Monday because i was sick so i stayed home with them_1 and we went to some of the KinderCares	1
user:so um i talked to another l[ady]- lady at church it was like Thursday of that week and she said oh i found the most wonderful place that i've been taking my daughter and i've know this girl i went to college with her so i really i you i- i value her opinion|agent:yeah|user:yeah basic	and she told me about a private one it it was associated with one of the churches here it's not the church i go to but it's you know it it was Lubbock View Christian Church and it's a private academy	0
user:you know they mark it all down and they let you know and|user:oh and the teachers love [vocalized-noise] Taylor got bit several times and Taylor bit several times and the teachers dealt with that we're like hey they're two and we keep them apart and we scold them and we correct them and|user:yeah	and you know they get over it real quick and he doesn't do it anymore and	0
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:and that's usually like you know i don't know when mine were going to Mother's Day Out it was like from nine to three so that was a pretty good pretty good time you know my babysitter would take them and then pick them up	so that worked out real good	1
agent:uh i didn't really look at American cars uh had a couple bad experiences with American cars|user:you couldn't couldn't find an American built car|agent:all the things it came with for the price i couldn't beat it	huh	1
user:fuel economy and and durability|user:yeah that's about the only thing to do i'm just i i'm looking for uh|agent:get out there and test drive	and i've got to have some high road clearance we got some property and i need to get out in the pasture a lot	1
user:yeah i've got a friend of mine's got a uh he bought a four door Jeep|agent:really|user:they say they're getting eighteen to twenty in them_1	with the {positrack} rear end instead of the four wheel drive	0
user:they don't look too bad i just you know i i have have to get in one to find out i just don't know if i could stand|agent:yeah i don't know i haven't been in the now ones that you know they look big on the road some of these uh|user:i don't know	you know being cooped up my wife's got uh	1
agent:[laughter-right]|user:but that's what they don't show you when they get you know when they get them off they show them jumping up and down hills and like that but they don't show you the repairs|agent:yeah	you know the front ends impossible to line up on mine	1
user:on down through Roundrock he just he just patrols up and down through that area|agent:Georgetown|user:Georgetown Georgetown or [noise] Georgetown	now that's a neat little car	1
agent:yeah|user:if you ever roll one that's pretty much it|agent:insurance	you know that	1
agent:great|user:good talking to you|user:okay [noise]	see you later bye bye	1
user:the tax base and how the taxes are distributed to the schools|user:they're not equitable within the state so they're changing that they're talking about changing the uh|user:as a matter of fact they're talking about changing the the tax situation in Texas because the the schools are not	which will probably mean uh another increase in property taxes	0
user:right|agent:then of course the price goes you know the value of the house is going to fall and the existing family homes were the ones that were falling the new homes they were building cheaper and and able to sell cheaper and so people weren't buying the existing family homes so|agent:and same time they were approving new starts in homes hand over fist well when you start having a large supply of homes	right	1
user:okay did you live in Texas after the uh|agent:that is correct|user:then uh all of your state income tax is deductible for federal income tax purposes	after they stopped letting you deduct uh sales tax on your tax return	1
user:yeah that's|agent:and so you they're paying more income tax to pay for your children to go to school it just you know doesn't make sense|agent:you know you've got five children in school instead of somebody that only has one or none	that's an interesting uh interesting concept i hadn't thought about that how you you you know that that's right i guess [laughter] in a sense	0
user:yeah that's i guess uh one thought that occurred to me uh|agent:[laughter-i] [laughter-mean]|user:[laughter]	is we're we're talking about having uh	0
user:is not what the not what the government's doing but where it's spending its money it's it's encouraging people to|user:because uh that's i think that's where our real you know the real problem with government is not|agent:yes	to uh	1
agent:and then all of a sudden everybody starting looking to the federal government|agent:and that you know the states would take care of the communities|agent:you know it used to be that communities would take care of their own	right it uh	1
agent:yeah|user:uh there are not i don't think that there are that many people that feel that way that with what they could get support for|user:uh seem to think that that's the way to go you know that	or making the American system work in the way it's originally designed to	1
user:[noise]|user:May [vocalized-noise]|agent:yeah that's when my nephew's birthday is and he goes well you should have it on the fifteenth so we'll see [laughter] [laughter]	yeah [laughter] well my husband's is on the fourteenth so we did miss that one day by a few hours there but we didn't care at that point so	1
user:uh-huh|agent:i think so|user:uh-huh and perhaps Emily will when she's a little older	uh how do you find	0
user:the reason i'm asking is because i have a dear dear friend whose father was alcoholic|agent:so i|user:uh-huh	and at fifty she and she was an only child	0
agent:and i find you know i think okay i want Emily to be this way and this is what i'm going to do to make her be that way and then i think no you can't do that|user:uh-huh|agent:take over the things that my dad fell short in	uh-huh	1
agent:if he had any opinions to give he would tell my mother and she would tell us and so we had almost no direct relationship with him|agent:well my dad in his alcoholism he was kind of irritating and it there were a few times he was violent towards my mother but it was almost he like|agent:um	uh-huh	1
user:he just didn't have the energy to deal with them and of course now|agent:uh-huh|user:the one who initiated having children so certainly he wanted them	uh he's very ex[cited]- he's retired and he's spending time with his grandchildren which shows how much he wished that he could have with his own	1
agent:yeah|user:uh he shows his feelings but he cannot express it and i think that's kind of sad in a way i see other fathers put their arms around their daughters or their sons and we have two daughters and a son|agent:uh-huh	and uh he just can't do that and i i know that he would if he could and i i kind of feel sorry for him because i think he misses a lot	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:working together|user:um-hum and they see that with my husband's retirement a little over a year ago we're having a wonderful time and i think they look at that and	and uh and that way i think we're doing a lot for our grandchildren	1
agent:well that's great|agent:w[ell]-|user:and then when she gets ready to trade it in she offers it to us and we buy it	so [laughter]	1
agent:oh really|user:around there's so much salt on the roads|user:but the problem with it is up here	that it's hard to keep	0
agent:we're really pleased with it|agent:we [laughter] we had a Firebird and we had to trade we guess we got to get rid of this thing because there's no way we can haul kids and junk and [laughter] stuff with that [laughter] so we got rid of that and|user:yeah	yeah so what do you buy what are you looking for you look for	0
agent:look|agent:is excellent gas mileage|agent:uh oh yeah but yeah uh that's not one of my first priorities when i'm looking for a new car	you what what do you look for uh ease of handling or roominess	1
agent:oh yes|agent:hum|user:uh i'm just like you gas mileage wasn't a priority it was it was comfort and it has to be has to have air	so down down where you guys are	1
agent:like we're from Missouri and when we moved|user:yeah|agent:i mean you you just can't sell a car down here that does not have air conditioning in it	oh are you	1
agent:oh it's it's eight p[ercent]- it's eight here|user:it's best to buy it that way because like our sales tax up here is seven percent|agent:yeah	it's eight percent down there	0
user:we got to pay|user:so so we've got to pay a fire tax and|agent:oh how [laughter-awful]	you know two taxes	1
user:an automobile that's that's got some class to it but i don't really i can't tell now|user:so we've got|agent:uh-huh	what kind of a car is coming down or what kind of a car i'm following unless i get up close enough to read the name on it	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and then my wife's got a a an eighty four Parisian Pontiac|user:i take it back and forth to work	and that's a big car it's a V8	0
user:yeah if you're going to pay the same amount of money and|agent:it just doesn't make sense to buy a used car down here|user:that's incredible	and you don't really know where it came from	1
agent:noticed all that grass coming up and i thought ooh we've got to start this mowing bit soon [laughter]|agent:yeah i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon and i|user:so i think we're a little -[a]head uh ahead of schedule on that	that's true it's been a [noise] a fun break but it the break is over	1
user:yeah that's probably a [vocalized-noise] a little bit under|agent:that's getting back to a little bit chillier|agent:[noise] but i think the highs are gonna be in the sixties and the lows in the forties	what it is for this time of year i- i think	0
agent:hm|user:is within five or six degrees of the all time record high|user:of say ninety nine degrees	and what that tells me is that the summer weather is very predictable	1
agent:hm|user:and a [noise] a lightning bolt was almost directly overhead and it was twenty six degrees out|user:[noise] i you know i was going into the grocery store	and i thought well gee i've i've never known it to lightning at that temperature	1
agent:i just don't move very [laughter-well] [laughter-when] [laughter-it's] [laughter-that] [laughter-cold]|user:nope|agent:yeah i don't don't like that super cold stuff	[noise] yep i i'm really enjoying this now	1
agent:swung a club for a purpose|agent:so it's been uh it's been almost a year i guess since i've actually uh|user:yeah	yeah i ha[ven't]- i haven't played in about two years and then i went out two weeks ago with the guys here i work at TI	0
agent:well great great that's good|user:came home and won the tournament the other day she's|user:she wants to get into it now after i	she's ready to get off into it but	0
agent:eventually i get people to come and visit me in Dallas and then i'll show them_1 that we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home|user:yeah|agent:that's been my [laughter-main] my main involvement is it seems like i go home and play golf more than i do around here but uh	yeah it's pretty nice we played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not they were amazed	0
agent:right|agent:um-hum|user:and then you know we've got some guys here they're you know four and five handicappers and they don't like to play with me because_1 i'm too slow for them_1 so	you know but [vocalized-noise] get somebody around your own handicap and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time	1
agent:you know you've basically tapped your resources there|user:yeah you need to|user:yeah	yeah	1
agent:yeah it it sounds like we've got real similar situations uh i i go home uh i've gone home every year now since i've moved to Dallas to|user:give her something to do that we both enjoy so|user:you know golf would give her the exercise she'd be outside	yeah	1

user:no|user:okay|user:it	i mean can you imagine how ridiculous it would be to try to do calc[ulations]- i mean it boggles the mind to try to think to do	0
user:places where they're producing a product|user:um|user:basic research all the way through uh we have a couple of systems that are actually	and what i've noticed is that the places where they're kind of doing fuzzy thinking	0

user:i think if uh|user:yeah i thought|agent:you are	people like Charles Manson	1
agent:kill somebody|agent:but yeah they there's you know there's always uh uh you know and and in a way you know i guess that's good i mean if you're going to [laughter] if you're going to|agent:um	you have to make sure they're guilty	1
user:you know|agent:well yeah but you know there there are so many people who just get get their jollies off of watching that|user:well it might scare some people off of doing the crimes	yeah i yeah i agree with you there too	1

agent:you know he gets three meals a day and and he probably|user:yeah|agent:and uh it it it just doesn't seem right that our tax money or somebody's tax money goes to keep him alive	that's more than some of the people out here who are out and out honest	1
agent:oh sure|user:uh i guess i just too young to understand this or something|agent:yeah	uh but uh	0
agent:and this ranger comes up with this light shines it on us and said that we're just bear bait out there we had our food you know|agent:our sleeping bags i guess|agent:on top of a picnic table with our	oh uh-huh	1

user:a relatively small percentage they still they sound humongous when they're you know you hear millions and sometimes billions of dollars spent and|user:uh that helps the rationale any but it's still angering to see the abuses uh even though they're uh|agent:right	and even some of the arguments over the national endowment for the arts and what's happening in that area it's still a pretty small chunk considering what actually flows through that government	1
user:yeah we have a real good you know police department and real good uh city services and boy the parks are all over the place and there's a lot of|agent:well that's good|user:we're in a particular part of the state that's pretty well off so it's it's like we get a lot of that back as far as local taxation goes	lot of money spent on us but uh the poor rural folks uh barely can get ambulance service and everything else so it's	0
user:an awful waste of time to have so many people having to fill out so much paper just to get rid of so few dollars in some of these cases|user:more money just trying to administer some of these programs than the programs are worth uh it seems uh|user:the uh bureaucracy seems to spend	so it make	1
user:i don't know whether it's|user:it does seem to be the case|user:right	worth and the economy has gone pretty well for a	0
user:but if you put the burden on|agent:right|user:you know a tax your income because now you're talking about having to report it and all that kind of stuff	the retailer who really doesn't care if you you know buy your groceries and the like he doesn't care who bought the groceries you're going to pay the tax on it	0
user:you're looking at having to do it on your own for the most part and then hope what you did didn't go away|agent:no|user:that's true plus what what there will be of it even if it's there isn't quite enough anyway [laughter-so]	yeah the uh	1
user:well actually i think it's good i i i hope that we uh uh get a chance to uh promote peace out there|user:[laughter]|agent:so uh what do you think about our involvement in the Middle East	uh because_1 i think without peace we're not going to get uh stable oil prices and	0
agent:um probably oh isn't isn't there a plan now to make a command center there or something|user:do you think the US is going to wind up keeping uh military bases over there|agent:bad shape [noise]	i i haven't heard that i i watch CNN every once in a while but i i haven't specifically heard anything about that	1

agent:yes yes absolutely|user:is a get little survey uh you know like we're doing with each other and and encourage people to to give that information back to the management|user:it would seem to me that if that if i owned a business the thing that i would want to do is	and then maybe somehow turn what ever negatives around into a positive	1

agent:yeah|user:when you take it with you|agent:no hum	the whole idea is to get away from it	1
user:but just like i say it's a beautiful area lots of hills to go camping in|agent:yeah|user:uh spring fed river that flows through the camp sites you know all along the river the water was real cold because it was spring fed	uh dad never believed in tent camping uh	0
agent:so you can kind of go in there and just bring your sleeping bag|agent:and a ceiling fan and screened uh windows|user:well	well that would be great there pretty co[ld]-	1
user:that's great i'd forgotten all about the Texan side and that's|agent:but you know he can walk back to the little cabin in about five minutes from there but it's it's a ninety nine acre i think it's a ninety nine acre in fact they have acquired some more now that they are going they're going to uh clear but it's a long term lease from the corps of engineers|user:yeah so it's time to quit	but you got to be a member of Texans to use it	1
user:yeah i expect it would|agent:and uh oh that thing eat gasoline [laughter] uh we could suck up thirty gallons in an afternoon of skiing|user:goodness	yeah but boy it would move you across the water though	1
user:sure|agent:okay i just i ca[n]- i just let me ask you one more question where do you ski uh where you ski|user:call this thing to a halt i appreciate talking to you Bill	uh	1
user:that sounds|agent:yeah and there's uh they have got some forty to fifty foot high cliffs around Possum Kingdom and you just get up and ski uh adjacent to those and uh and it doesn't make any difference how windy it is you don't notice it|agent:its too open	oh no	1
user:then you know that was it|agent:yeah|user:and if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something you know if you had if you were a teacher	until the kids you were little	1
agent:yeah|user:yeah i at least for a lot of women depending on on what she did i've|agent:but uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you're going to make at the job	i was an engineer with uh	1
agent:um-hum|user:that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on Saturdays|user:you know things that would come up at work	as is you know as is needed	0
user:and so it was in my case i i just uh|user:yeah|agent:that doesn't really go with the family	decided that as long as my kids were little	0
user:y[ou]-|user:and so they're getting they they get the socialization with other kids and|agent:um-hum	you know and not really school but	0
user:and now with the photography|agent:um-hum|user:i liked my job really well but i was just pulled in so many different directions i was it was just driving me crazy	that's you know it's working that's what i'm doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a	0
agent:um-hum|user:they just you know just kind of scoot it on another spot on the [vocalized-noise] on the sink and and put the next plate down and|user:yeah and without and and it's just they don't look at things most men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it	and in a while get around to it and i think most women walk in and and	0
agent:it's someone you know keeping an eye on the kids but the kids are basically doing what they want|user:yeah|user:yeah	yeah	1
user:but if no one does anything when they're little|agent:um-hum|user:then you just you add onto it as they get older	then it's twice as hard as i think as they get older	1
agent:it's been|user:talk about what the weather's been like|user:okay we're supposed to	let's see uh	1
agent:me too|user:i like the warm weather [laughter]|agent:[laughter]	and the winter wasn't that bad i was really grateful that it didn't get that bad this winter	0

user:but|agent:well what about professionally|agent:yeah	uh i i was	0
user:and if they just keep him that hurts their salary cap so that guy's got Dallas in a big old bind|user:uh they can't hardly trade him because_1 nobody wants to pay that much for him|user:so whether he plays or not they've got to pay him ten million dollars so if they	but uh they they i think they've just got to forget about him and uh	0

user:uh-huh|agent:you know at your home where you could just turn it in so they they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area|user:sure	uh-huh	1
agent:um seedling to plant you know [laughter] you could take the the mulch home with you you know and take buckets of that home so that was really good idea i thought|user:right|user:absolutely	uh-huh right	1
agent:just briefly on the market that was recyclable but the landfill have to do something special you know for those|agent:so i don't know what's the you know right thing to do but i really would hope that they would come up i know there was a brand|user:yeah	[noise] uh-huh	1

agent:exactly|user:thirty six [laughter-inches] to the yard and things like that|agent:exactly	but uh	0
user:and since then i have discovered uh other engineers|agent:uh-huh|user:to a rationalized system and and used to making all the necessary conversions	are very prone to make mistakes	1
user:uh technical literature that you pick up and catalogs and so forth that you will find|user:uh and little things like that i i notice in a lot of uh|agent:very good idea yeah yeah	the metric units expressed in parenthesis or sometimes the other way around the metric units are expressed first	0
agent:you know i just when i going into it i just had this block and i went there's just no way i'm going to be able to learn this and when i sat down and really said okay just you know forget your old prejudices and really look at it you know and once you look at it's so really simple you know you there's really nothing to memorize there's nothing to learn it just all works the same you know you just you know transform that little you know dot from one place one one way to the other you know and that's about all you have to do so|user:uh-huh|agent:like i said i was just totally amazed at how at how very easy it was you know i i just couldn't	yeah	1
agent:uh-huh|user:and electric charge|user:and the the basic units of measure are are distance and time and mass	and so if you convert all your measure into those uh fundamental units	0
agent:getting us all accustomed to seeing both you know but most people don't pay any attention you know it's going to take some education right along with it most people don't know what that means you know so|agent:you know like the bank clocks and stuff like that it tells you you know fahrenheit and centigrade and it's going take those kinds of things you know switching you know [vocalized-noise]|agent:yeah no you know you look at most of the	yeah	1
agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	okay Jay um	1
agent:i see|user:uh mostly outsiders coming in and you know robbing or breaking into automobiles and stealing uh|user:really hasn't been a problem it's been uh	radios and cassettes and things like that	1
user:[noise] but the cities down there yeah and and|agent:okay so that's real close|user:and Providence is only like a dozen miles from from where i am	and the next one up is uh is a small city between me and Providence	1
user:you know not to not to go out and scuff up and|agent:that's right [laughter]|agent:so	but	1
user:we had we had uh an incident in our town not too far from where i live where uh|user:yeah|agent:and they'll just go out and do anything they can to do it	the police made a raid on an[d]- and most of them were teenagers or or	1
agent:right|user:is also always very prohibitive now unless your parents are wealthy|user:and going to school	you know you either have to take a loan or	0
agent:[laughter]|user:it was just all lights|agent:right	but you couldn't tell there was a problem	0
agent:right|user:yeah because there's more and more there's more murders we had uh|agent:is uh definitely something's got to be done on that because_1	just in southern Massachusetts and Rhode Island over the weekend we had five murders	1
agent:i think yeah that's true|user:they're being overwhelmed i think anyhow i mean|agent:uh	the fire power against them now is is atrocious	0
agent:but|user:um|user:yeah	and when i say there's no deterrent you know of the death penalty	0
EMPTY	[noise]	1
agent:and uh trying desperately to uh get ahead with the company|user:uh-huh|agent:um i was gainfully employed by Safeway Stores Incorporated	uh-huh	1
agent:stopped working for them in uh seventy eight seventy nine|user:did it work|agent:um i think so i- i i i	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah i'm not sure if that was because you know eighties was like the uh the me decade [vocalized-noise] and uh everybody was into me and then we are getting back into us|user:social movement and more individual m[ovements]- lots of individual movements [noise] in a sense|user:so there's less you think now there's less of a a	the me decade uh-huh	1
user:[noise]|user:no longer being sort of on top [vocalized-noise] i had the impression|user:pessimism with America	well i mean there was the quote unquote losing of the Vietnam war which was a blow and it was right around that time when i started becoming socially	0
user:have been more incremental|user:and all the changes that have happened in the last uh even during my adulthood|user:and i	they've been continual perhaps and good gains have been made but there hasn't been the same sort of	0
user:a lot of pessimism growing|user:so i see i see a lot of uh|user:and in the sense that how could America have gone from being number one to possibly being number two to you know our former enemies and things like that and um	um	1
agent:i mean you know if you had long hair in high school in the sixties you got labeled a hippie and you keep that image your whole life [laughter] [vocalized-noise] no matter what you do|agent:um [laughter]|user:uh-huh yes [laughter]	uh-huh yeah yeah	1
agent:and words spelled wrong not marked as such|user:uh-huh|agent:uh i had when i was down in Dallas for two years i had uh my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong	yeah	1
user:and you get more and more people who would just end up there because it's uh|agent:yeah|user:hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay work for low social prestige just because they care about good education	it's the safety net of those of you know average intelligence or something they can always teach	1
agent:yeah and in some incidences i think they ought to ought not to have a jury um [laughter]|user:oh is that right|agent:you know some instances i don't you always have the option now in criminal i guess you always have a jury but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not	yeah	0
agent:yeah|user:they wou[ld]- they had settled while we were deliberating|agent:oh	now the one thing i did approve of there was that we didn't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case	0
agent:uh-huh|user:yeah i was a witness in a case in a criminal case and it was absolutely horrifying to me how that operated because|agent:i don't feel that sure and who knows what the jury will say because sometimes you know the juries come down with a result and you go gee [laughter]	so much evidence was excluded	0
user:well and then in a lot of|agent:um and we protect him so much but what about the rest of the society you know what are we doing for them we're kind of you know forgetting about them and i think sometimes that a criminal should kind of if he breaks law especially it he's a repeater the law shouldn't just always cover for him that some of his rights as should be taken [laughter]|user:uh-huh	yeah in criminal cases uh for instance you can't bring up prior convictions unless they are somehow directly related to the case	0
user:yeah|agent:[laughter]|user:uh been in seminary to become a priest and	you would have thought the guy was just pure as the driven snow but i happen to know his background and i know that he would have sold out his mother for uh uh shorter sentence	1
agent:uh they barred priors on this uh person and they never then told us i guess because priors had a reason as to why these two people were very much in hatred of each other|agent:yeah i witnessed one trial many years ago when i was first um studying to be a paralegal and uh|user:sure would	um	1
agent:right|user:if you were allowed to ask the witnesses things or if or the lawyers things or even the judge|agent:uh-huh	but particularly the witnesses	1

user:i was reading an article in the paper the other morning these doctors are baffled about this eighty seven year old man|agent:yeah|user:i- i wonder though it's i think it really depends on the person	who eats thirty boiled eggs a day	1
user:and uh|agent:yeah|user:yeah good and low	i mean you'd think by looking at me my i'd have a bad heart and everything	0
agent:sort of like the draft do you know in the Army you're not going|user:uh services|user:like in other places where they have a you know like mandatory you know	yeah	1
user:well there i don't think there's any way it can you know like they say this proposal would any[where]-|agent:i definitely agree with you i would hate to to see that become mandatory|agent:uh so that the public is a little more aware of it but uh	would get anywhere because of the	0
user:and but you go into this whole big lottery|agent:i see|user:everybody that is unlucky enough has to do the military service	every year and you know each uh your last three digits of your document you know like your social security number you're matched up	0
agent:golly|user:waiting for them to announce the number you know|user:everybody that's your same age is l[istening]- listening to the radio	and it's like and then you know you have people you know going you know it's like everywhere you know you have	0
user:the thing is is that you know you just get treated i mean o[ne]- one of the guys that was doing it|user:and so i mean but you know it's like|agent:i see	was uh like uh a waiter at one of the restaurants that kn[ow]- you know like the military had	1
agent:well yeah yeah you're thirty years old and|user:and then the other thing is when i get out of college at twenty eight with my [laughter-BS] you know it's like by the time|user:you know it's like	yeah	1
user:oh that's great no uh uh|agent:well i left TI in January but i signed up for this before i did|user:are are you at TI Austin or	my daughter has talked to my daughter up here with us i have another one	0
user:the salary thing TI doesn't quite always do it right well what about our our our financial budget well you you should have a lot of information on a budget then if you're|user:i've been with TI i'm just going to be fifteen years this year and that's a tough thing uh|user:oh yeah it's uh that's the finances i guess we're on the subject of finances it is tough uh	uh	1
agent:[laughter]|agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:she does it all now for about ten years and i don't even she complains to me about it she threatens me to give it back to me and i said i've been a happy man since i haven't fooled with that checkbook you know [laughter]	so i know it's a big pain to try to do that	1
user:cars very|user:he's a college graduate type guy he's been in all he's an entrepreneur and he gives very practical financial advice about|user:inter[national]- oh he's nationally famous	you know not not nothing college level	0
agent:uh-hum uh-hum [noise]|user:i'm not uh i have one again at UT down there now her first year|agent:you know	and she's almost gone through her whole college fund [laughter-you] [laughter-know]	1
user:band she got you know five hundred dollars at a at a clip|user:uh|user:and uh	through bands through leadership	0
user:uh of course you have to have some sort of record in high school uh of of achievement and everything but sometimes|agent:um-hum|user:and they don't even have a dozen applicants because uh uh the kids are going off after the big money	it's just uh like our band gave money away we're a band booster club we gave we give uh two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids uh who we think were worthy you know so	0
agent:yeah|user:you got to be a little flexible uh in my old age i'm trying to just hang in there until i get my kids through school|agent:oh absolutely	and then i'd like to teach maybe mathematics or something i'm trying to study for that now	1
user:go to work for UT|agent:okay|user:another clue for you for college money	uh we have a friend who works who is a secretary for TCU you know up here	0
agent:of course i used to like Jim McMahon and you know uh Walter Payton|agent:and um|user:oh yeah	yeah	1
agent:that's too bad [laughter]|agent:gee that's too bad|user:uh more or less [laughter]	and well it's hard uh because	1
user:and and it was interesting because the AFL|agent:oh yeah|user:and i and i may have been the only one that did both because the mentality in Dallas was that you couldn't like both you had to like one and hate the other	uh when when the Chiefs when the Texans were playing they would give the scores of the Cowboy games and the NFL games but the NFL refused to admit they existed so when the Cowboys were playing you never got the scores of their games	0
agent:huh|user:i wonder if that guy that's in the eleventh row see he bought thousand dollar [laughter-bonds]|user:and so i got the first choice of the two hundred and fifty dollar bonds so i was in the upper deck in the twelfth row on the fifty yard line	that guy so uh that happened then uh	1
agent:huh|user:these people will negotiate with the players and get them to sign a contract and if they won't sign a contract they won't draft them|user:and when it comes their time to choose they get thirty minutes or so	and and they will take the time allotted to make their choices to do that	1
agent:that it just kind of turned me against them|user:yeah|agent:i got so tired i i guess i just got so tired of hearing about the Dallas Cowboys and and you know what[ever]- whatever the Cowboys did that day	[laughter-yeah] and and and and and the seventies were really a it it saw the team's emergence as a super power coincided with the movement to Texas Stadium	0
agent:but they were still bet your money paid if somebody sent me you know i|agent:uh-huh|agent:are you up there too	yeah	1
user:the the United States as a government can't get involved in a civil war in another country because it's not|user:well unfortunately|agent:but they don't have no say so in it i guess	it i[t's]-	1
agent:what's uh Saddam did|agent:and killed all them people|user:um-hum	yeah it it's just unfortunate that the Kurdish people didn't get their own	0
agent:yeah|user:Ira[n]- to Iran and into Syria i know that the S[audi]- the uh that Saudi Arabia has some pretty strict|user:going into	uh	1
user:yeah but those uh those countries are so extremely wealthy|agent:if you're the|agent:i wish it was as good over here as it is over there but	but from what i understand though that it's pri[vate]-	1
agent:um-hum|user:rising against the the uh the leadership in in the Russian state|user:a lot of their their civil problems where they've got their uh Baltic states	uh is the same type of deal as what occurred with the Kurdish people it's the same type of situation where	1
agent:pushed on you it's whatever choice you want to make you can make it yourself|agent:it's not told to you or|user:yeah	and and when the when the United States was founded the people	0
EMPTY	[noise] okay so uh what do you think about it	1
agent:dismissal or treatment or whatever but that that what it would do is it would trigger perhaps uh one or two more stages where further tests could be ta[ken]- uh done|user:right|agent:reason for whatever they might be going to do if they found a positive uh	um-hum	1
user:and it takes some drastic steps at this point|agent:um-hum|user:anywhere is on drugs or not	and i think personally the drastic step has to be	0
agent:down the wrong path and uh|agent:really|agent:who um just got	right	1
agent:ground you know some rules that protect|agent:um so it seems to me that that um there needs to be some|agent:because it makes a bigger problem	um-hum	1
agent:it was nice talking to you|user:all right|agent:i guess if that's all we've done and i guess we've talked long enough	it was it was talk nice talking to you too	0
agent:[laughter] yeah i guess so but as far as the weight bearing|user:well it winds up being a little stress on the shoulder joints after a while [laughter]|agent:no stress on the joints	yeah	0
user:and in fact out here in Oakton we have uh|agent:oh|user:and all of them have uh at least a twenty five meter or twenty five yard uh swimming pool	there's a fifty meter uh pool called Oakmar	0
agent:oh that's good|user:yeah well i have we have a uh recreation center which is almost right across the street from our uh office|user:yeah	and so i hit there at seven o'clock in the morning	0
agent:oh it's fun {jazzercise} is really fun|user:yeah well that looks that looks like so much work to me i|agent:um-hum um-hum and and on Saturdays i go to a {jazzercise} class that's my	yeah	1
user:and uh|agent:yeah uh-huh|user:it looks like you're constantly walking up stairs	i think that should get your heart rate right up there at the maximum and keep it there	1
user:and uh i sometimes i may not be conscious of keeping count but uh|agent:jeez|user:and uh so that's sixty six lengths of the pool	you know every now and then when i do check up and say where is my count i	0
agent:like the the the less you exercise the tireder you are [laughter-i'm] [laughter-sorry]|user:[noise]|agent:it seems like [noise]	um-hum	1
agent:[laughter] course you probably i have i have waist length hair so you probably don't have that problem [vocalized-noise] [laughter]|user:some sprints or something like that and then running back again [laughter]|user:heading for the pool jumping in swimming	[laughter]	1
agent:oh that's good exercise|user:uh but she's taking up snow skiing and she got me involved|agent:oh really	so i was out there you know stark terror coming down the side of the hill	1
agent:little competition there [laughter]|user:and the other two got jealous and they went out and says well i'm going to go and do it too [laughter-so] [laughter-they] learned too|agent:really	and uh we went to a good resort and the instructors were there	0
user:we were lucky um|agent:do you all have have you had a good snow this year|agent:[laughter]	we were going to Seven Springs up in Pennsylvania and the first time we went up there	0
agent:i guess as far north as you are if you like gardening you've still got a couple months to go haven't you|user:because_1 it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something|agent:yeah [laughter]	oh yeah um well right now we um start our seeds inside	1
agent:[laughter]|user:i really don't i'm just wrote my resume up because|user:when you go across the lake um i don't know why we have so much going for us	told we might be facing layoff over at Digital and they've never had well they've had layoffs recently but	0
agent:hum yeah|user:we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with uh dried red flowers and dried white flowers and uh eucalyptus|user:and you can make fl[ower]- uh dried flower arrangements and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun and	you you know what eucalyptus is it's	1
agent:[laughter-yeah]|user:yeah it it looks really po[tent]- potent stuff|user:[laughter]	but uh	0
user:uh like little kids' furniture|user:for um his kids and he makes uh|agent:routers	he gets right into it and uh	1
agent:yeah mostly i think in a place where it's really cold they do it in the fall let them_1 winter|user:oh that's good i guess they they say you can plant them_1 in the spring or the fall|agent:so what i'm planting or actually transplanting is a tree that's or trees that are already leafed out	um	1
user:i like the way that i like the way that idea of the south is|agent:in Georgia yeah yeah|user:uh it's in Georgia it's yeah it's right outside of Macon and and it's just a	but when i think of Texas i think of nothing but	0
agent:so that doesn't bother me but i don't think it's fair it's it's too um|agent:and it doesn't bother me any because i've quit drinking and i quit smoking|agent:liquor	yeah	1
user:how it's being managed and so forth i mean i- i think there could be a better system and we would get more for our money|user:too much tax considering what we're getting for it and|user:i- i think that we probably are paying a little	it's totally out of our hands so	0
agent:uh yes|agent:oh|user:uh bug [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-in] [laughter-some] [laughter-other] [laughter-part] [laughter-of] [laughter-the] [laughter-world] or some such thing and and our tax money pays for those things and i think that's wrong	i	1
user:somewhere|agent:[noise] oh definitely|user:and i think that's a mistake	somewhere you know we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away	1
user:well i think they're very unfair in the amount of|user:disagrees with or you know says hey we're not going to allow that|user:you have something that the IRS	penalties and interest that they can attach to that	0
agent:i mean you think about it now they they get about sixteen holidays a year|agent:uh the private industry|user:[laughter] yeah	that's a lot	1
user:for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is|user:well i- i have another thing that i thought about too um|user:yeah	and you know we're not typically talking about big dollars but	0

user:uh-huh|agent:you know until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but i don't think we want to make that decision either|user:history	no	1

user:no i think it's good in fact uh i don't know what the statistics were but i think that they were very surprised to find it|user:yeah|agent:as contract person we have to do random drug testing too so it doesn't bother me i don't feel like it's really a violation of privacy or anything	so low i think they were expecting it to find uh like the national average at TI and i think it was tremendously down	1
agent:right yeah so that's real beneficial for the company and the employee|user:partake in uh some of the benefits o[f]- of rehabilitation and everything so|user:you know the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs actually go and then uh usually a lot of them uh	yeah our our numbers have been way down i don't know what they were	1
user:but uh they say that there it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and and they're not you know in other words there's very few mistakes and that of course has got to be critical it's got to be if you have a drug testing program it's got to be with a very very good agency you don't just have you know some local|agent:yeah|user:for someone to really come back positive and they were not and i haven't heard of any now i'm not in personnel or anything	uh group do it it's got to be a a a highly qualified agency	1

user:and|agent:uh-huh yeah i think that's a really good thing to encourage|user:and they're always over in someone else's house so our we've been lucky that uh our house is usually the place where the kids could come you know	and then you can kind of keep an [noise] you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want but at least you see what's going on and uh	0
agent:[laughter]|agent:gets worse|user:th[ey]- they cost you practically nothing from one to five and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons [noise]	[noise] but uh it's well worth it and everything	1
agent:right yeah there's yeah|user:so many calls will be some[thing]- a prize and everything|user:oh okay well i i didn't know what they're they were going to do they sent us a little booklet i just got it a week or so ago saying you know	well that's great well what kind of cash i've forgotten what were they going to do	0

agent:oh yeah|user:and so he i think he got a real good deal of course they're fully loaded usually and|agent:sure	so it's a i think it's a pretty good option	1
agent:uh more realistic|agent:so then it becomes|user:um-hum	right	0
agent:no huh-uh|user:yeah that's not bad|agent:oh i'm thinking around twenty or twenty five dollars	it'd be well worth it if you're considering buying a car [laughter] to find out	1

user:um yeah|agent:well and now the way they're uh treating those Kurds is that what they its terrible and we've just kind of backed off i don't understand that why we|user:uh probably could have struck a deal with the Saudi's and just let them_1 have Iraq	well i don't either and it's certainly foreseeable the Kurds have always been	0
user:try to give them_1 some aid i mean we helped the Afghanistanis there's know reason why we shouldn't have helped the Kurds|agent:[noise]|user:it it was certainly foreseeable right after the war i mean it should have been obvious if it it was obvious to me it should have been obvious to the people in Washington there should have been some plans to	didn't have to involve troops could have just given them_1 uh	0

agent:car safety seats seat belts we can legislate them we can legislate say children cannot get into school without having certain immunizations to protect them you would think that we would uh you know take it another step further than the|agent:legislate uh things now like uh children in the seats in|agent:but w[e]- but uh we we do uh	oh you mean uh yeah right	1
user:um-hum|agent:and they they talking with the children on that level and that's to me the level where you need to have it you can't wait till their already in high school because they've already tried it long before then|user:um-hum	um-hum	1

user:the car payment sucks|user:well you know the auto budget|user:and	a hell of a lot of it dry	1
agent:it's kind of it's kind of strange here the way things go uh here if you have an accident and no one's injured the police won't even show up|agent:yeah|agent:um-hum	you're kidding	1

user:yeah well|agent:oh my God ate you alive|user:property taxes and	Colorado	1

user:i was a|agent:um-hum|user:well i've been with the company sixteen years now	WF for several years	1

user:[noise]|agent:okay okay|user:right right well i'm going to push one and let them start recording okay	okay Karen uh you know it always has amazed me and in fact i think i wrote a paper on this in college uh that the national elections	0
user:and uh i was in the Phi[llipines]- uh in Portugal not stationed there but i was i was there on business and visiting a family uh that i knew very well in fact the guy had been my boss when we were in Malaysia|agent:um-hum|user:uh uh from whatever country you're in you go to the United States Embassy and vote there	and uh it was with with TI and i went to his house for dinner and they had a young son who was probably about in the seventh grade and was attending a British school in uh uh in Portugal and this was in	0
agent:well you can make a big difference in those and it's more more to home a lot of the time|user:and it bothers me and i- i think that's even more important to vote in those because uh|agent:yeah	oh sure and	1
agent:uh-huh|user:yeah i i'd say reading's probably one of my biggest ones because it's the type of thing that you can you can do a little bit at a time whereas i would love to do crafts and stuff if i just had the time to do it and|agent:oh [laughter]	or if i had the space i live in a pretty small apartment and uh	0
agent:mostly just stuff that i can you know use right around the house|user:um-hum|agent:things to hang on the wall	um-hum	1
agent:[laughter] and i've done some of the crewel and the um|user:yeah that's pretty [laughter-understandable]|agent:and uh i[t]- it was just too much to begin with and i think that kind of discouraged me from doing much more [laughter-with] it	um-hum	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:[laughter]|user:whenever i go visit my parents they're always saying well bring some of your [laughter-tapes] and they they always borrow a few of them_1 i was over there they live in Duncanville and i was over there at Easter	and they said bring some tapes with you so they they are always borrowing my tapes	0

agent:yeah|agent:um-hum|user:i just i don't think an apartment is big enough for a dog dogs to me dogs need a yard even little dogs they just need a yard	cats cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine but i just think dogs need need to be outside so	1
agent:and it's nice to uh it would be nice to have one i guess what do you think|agent:could be doing on a PC instead of here instead of doing them at the h[ome]- at work they're for the house but i do them on occasion at work|agent:a number of things that i could	i share your your uh	1
user:but i i do no[t]- obviously notice it i i think the thing that surprises me most when i change work to home environment is the cursor speed and after i if initially get over the uh|user:uh|user:Works and WordPerfect	the cursor speed in the sense of moving linearly across the screen	0
user:a PC for a great deal of things in in private life uh|user:use|user:i	i'm a church treasurer	0
user:ex[cept]-|user:um|agent:um well that's good	i don't have	1
user:i|user:um|user:more so than i do over over access speed	guess that i have gotten to the point where if if i didn't have the personal computer	0
agent:right|user:frequently as a dumbhead to get to the mainframe and|user:but i use it	and there i tend on almost all of my editing and stuff to to be using some fairly powerful editors and word processors and and wordproof but	0
agent:i don't know maybe someday we'll uh get around to getting something decent uh|agent:but uh|agent:my i've done that on occasion at at work and my wife does some uh teaching you know little bitty weekend type teaching for some women in the area and and she likes to work up little outlines and things in this format and so i do all the work for her at work and it would really be nice to be able to do it here and say is this what you want you know instead of going back and forth every day it takes us a little while to get it right	that's	1
user:uh i suspect Lotus One Two Three and spreadsheet application|agent:[laughter]|user:noticed how wonderful it might be	might be the one common thread	0
user:tends to crawl uh|user:right i i do have some uh retirement modeling that i've done at home that uh|user:right	which on which i've just turned the calculation off in between	0
user:in on um|user:back in August when all of the news and all of the media began to focus|user:since uh all this Middle East crisis began so i haven't really paid that much attention like since [noise]	Iraq and the so the last thing that i remember	0
agent:um-hum um-hum|user:a[s]- as we did and as we sold arms to [noise] pardon me to Iraq when we wanted them to fight Iran|agent:um-hum	and then uh	0
agent:right and the probably the bigge[st]- biggest problem down there is that's where the that's the drug entry points in their economies|user:really modern cities|user:[noise] i mean there's just very few	um-hum	1
agent:whenever the opportune moment arises|agent:uh leaders can use uh use that|user:um-hum	yes it's really kind of sad and	0
agent:sure did|user:made me stop and think a minute about|agent:okay	not worrying so much about the Middle East crisis i know that it's not settled but [noise] there are other areas that we could focus our attention on	1
user:uh|agent:i do too it it's kind of hard to find time sometimes but|user:i love it	do you work	0
agent:they they um|user:oh|agent:Texas Instruments Cafeteria	they have a TI plant in Texas in Kingsport	1

agent:uh-huh|user:i just break it up in a glass bowl|agent:yes	and then i mix up uh	1
agent:uh recipe|agent:and you take a uh sugar cookie|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:because it's|agent:uh-huh|agent:[noise]	low fat	1
user:yeah|user:no|agent:no and that's some[thing]- that's something that just you know it it doesn't take a long time to fix and it's really good and it's really good for you	it's real quick	1
agent:i'm sorry i keep coughing i've had a bad [laughter-cold] [laughter]|agent:[noise]|user:no uh-huh it keeps a long time	[laughter-oh]	0
agent:definitely go with it it'll have to be a rice dish|agent:and um|user:uh-huh	right uh-huh that sounds good	1
agent:okay|user:basil|user:and just a little bit of um	and then uh	0
agent:[laughter]|user:LaRoute|user:i'm not French	Gastro LaMink	0
agent:we don't have that much of it now as long as we have plenty of vegetables and lots of chicken|agent:you know|user:that's right i don't think it would	uh-huh	1
user:one of my daughters sent me uh|agent:so|user:uh-huh	Colorado Cookbook put out by the Junior League of Denver	0
agent:yeah just mix the canned beans together|user:you buy the canned baked canned baked beans|agent:yeah just	uh-huh	1

user:uh-huh|agent:brim um-hum um-hum|user:bream	and um also they have these uh wasp	1
agent:oh okay|user:they catch catfish you on accident sometimes|user:um	and then whenever we do trot lines and stuff they usually get catfish	1
agent:and got them_1 and i think it's the first time that he's ever that he's actually prepared and ate what they caught he and some friends of his the first time they've ever done anything but throw them_1 back|agent:although he went somewhere with some friends last week and fished for catfish|agent:but we don't deplete the fish population because we pull them_1 up and look at them_1 admire them_1 and take them_1 off and throw them_1 back	oh	1
agent:so i went and sold it and never bought again and it's too bad now the kids are teenagers they want they'd love to get out there and learn to [laughter-ski] and do the boating and and fishing again so we['ll]- probably do something like that do you do you camp at the lake a lot|agent:uh was [vocalized-noise] gigantic compared to what use we were getting out of it|user:yeah	oh yeah	1
agent:oh okay exactly half way between Shreveport and Dallas um how how long does it take you to get there from Shreveport|user:he says its exactly half way between Shreveport and Dallas|agent:and i was i is it out like near Tyler or Texarkana or Parish	it's	1
agent:uh they didn't do as well this year but we saw them we went down to Austin last year and saw them beat the Longhorns in the regionals|user:yeah they are|agent:yeah y[our]- oh of course they are one of the best	oh	1

agent:okay|user:well we had some rain we've had a li[ttle]- i live in Oak Cliff so|agent:dry out there we didn't have a whole lot we just had a little bit lot of dew this morning	we've had a	0
agent:there is a difference uh when i used to drive a convertible all the time i'd have the top down and maybe it was sixty in Dallas and then i'd drive up into Plano and be like go[sh]- i'm cold you [laughter-know]|user:yeah|agent:and everything but	i'll be darn	1
agent:no Little M|user:n[orth]- up [vocalized-noise] when i where i am now or|agent:just straight north	that's north north yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:oh the little metal tag and everything and everything yeah|user:i think the name might still be on it down at the bottom somewhere but i can't think of what it is	but uh ooh i just love i[t]- and i pick them and bring them_1 in i just love roses	1
agent:you know then they let you know you write in and they let you know later on what the r[esults]- general results were throughout the United States|agent:and then they um|agent:are named like you know you can suggest names for them_1 because of what you think and things like that	well that is really neat i'd enjoy doing something like you must have a big yard though to be able to put	1
agent:we get really horrendous weather in the front of our house|user:northwest|agent:kind of like north northwest and so the back is is like southeast and so we get	i'll be darned	0
agent:they die and that's that's what really kills them is the too much water|agent:and so when there's too much water|agent:they are susceptible to rotting	oh	1
agent:yeah it works great you know i've got and my problem [laughter-is] i've [laughter-got] [laughter-more] [laughter-than] [laughter-i] [laughter-know] what to do [laughter-with] [laughter-i've] [laughter-got] so many different varieties and stuff but i mean i've got|user:i'll be darn i'm gonna try that|agent:that will form off of that one leaf	[laughter]	1
agent:yeah right|agent:um-hum|user:two part-time parents if you're lucky [laughter] um	i uh it's it's funny because_1 both of u[s]- both of us then were	0
agent:there's so many material things to be had out there that a lot of people think oh but if we both work we can get a really big house and we can get two really nice cars we can take a vacation we can do this and|user:um-hum|agent:well i know the choice to either work or to be a mother is probably pretty difficult because i think women just naturally tend to have those instincts that you you know you protected the children and you you want to be with the children yet	yes	1
agent:um-hum|user:and and frankly it's the way that men are um men don't have this choice you know they don't feel this choice um|user:um	uh in most subcultures in America that that i've been exposed to if the man were to say	0
user:um-hum|agent:for a couple of weeks when his wife had their baby now it might have been just to take care of her and the baby instead of having you know a a nurse or someone come in or|agent:one of the area supervisors uh in my area as a matter of fact took off um	yeah	1
agent:right|agent:um-hum|user:yeah i actually think i i'm i'm somewhat encouraged by that trend because after all people live longer lives now so it's not like you c[an]- you know it's not like you're going to uh you know pass away before your child is an adult i mean barring un[forseen]- you know unforeseen circumstances	and i think	0
agent:she's she's yeah this is her second term i think she's going to going to uh|user:uh-huh|user:oh really	uh-huh	1
agent:well i think we've we've gotten our f[ive]- five minutes or six or seven or whatever so|agent:i agree|agent:right [laughter]	well they've gotten their five minutes worth of us i've enjoyed talking with you	1
user:um|agent:sweet sixteen once or twice|agent:so they made it to the [noise]	yeah that's not too bad	1
agent:every game|user:oh yeah i watched every uh i watched all three games of that and uh i was very pleased with all three games because_1 Kansas|agent:so did you watch the uh final four this year	uh you know i was pulling for Kansas on the other side so it was it was real nice to have the the teams that were there	1
agent:they shut all that down and made them_1 pay half court it seemed and|user:you know the fast breaks and and|agent:fast breaks and things and	right	0
agent:Boston Celtics|agent:and uh|agent:between Chicago and uh and uh	oh yeah	1
agent:i use to say Akeem Olajuwon was the dominant player you know when [vocalized-noise] against any team he would dominate but|agent:pretty much you know|agent:he's got to be	um-hum	1
agent:he ru[ined]- ruined his sweet position|user:[laughter] that's what i think|agent:oh boy what a good job he had	yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:yep that's true|agent:those are what m[akes]- makes a champion i guess	well	0
user:[noise]|agent:some Republican leanings because i am division one you know|agent:i do have	[laughter] well i uh to answer that one before we get to our subject you know i always get a kick out of Republicans who	0
agent:financing the same property three and four times|agent:but|agent:were doing things not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit	right	1
agent:everyone forgets whose money it was|agent:yeah it|user:uh be more than what you paid for it and they just never even got conservative with our money at all	right	1
agent:we as Americans weren't producing anything it was all inflation|user:yeah|agent:for what they would cost and we weren't producing anything	yeah	1
agent:it is a life and death struggle with Jap[anese]- with the Japanese|user:because it comes right back to them you know|user:it it still a lot of the workers don't understand that uh they need to put out the best that they can	right	1
agent:no [laughter] that's not [laughter-good] but|user:uh well that's good|agent:and uh i am degreed though nonexempt	no right i mean that's good that you're degreed uh uh	0
agent:[laughter] it's|user:i call it my recession job|user:essentially standby and problems uh all all nights and weekends that's my i only get one weekend off a month right now	uh being [vocalized-noise] basically an engineer and liking uh	0
agent:on their home values|agent:a lot of people out there are trying to retire|agent:to realize that	oh yeah i know what you mean	1
user:something i almost think there's some politics around here because|agent:Secorski Boeing|user:and then all of a sudden Secorski got it yeah Secorski Boeing Boeing doesn't need the money	the metroplex here in the Dallas Fort Worth area the uh	0
agent:yeah i do i do i work and and uh Brian's in a day care center he's uh he was two in December so he's not quite two and a half yet and|user:yeah [laughter] yeah uh do you work|user:i have three	okay	1
user:yeah|user:yeah|user:yeah	yeah yeah	1
user:right|agent:but i thought okay i'm going to keep an open mind here and the new people that came in it just wasn't it just wasn't the same and their their attitude and philosophy was just completely opposite from mine and i|user:oh gosh	wasn't the same uh-huh	1
agent:he didn't leave the baby yeah|agent:uh-huh|user:i mean she was already two and a half so it wasn't you know she wasn't an infant	yeah	0
agent:yeah i was going to say they're getting to the age where you can you can kind of trust that a little bit yeah|agent:are these yeah|user:i'm not i think i can leave them home for a if i can work part of the day you know i'm going to leave them home	right	1
agent:oh that's wonderful|user:right she goes to seminars and uh she gets home visitations by this s[tate]- uh uh i don't know state boards i guess some of them and then some by the association and they|user:care provider	have weekly meetings and everything and so it's just really really well regulated	0
agent:even at that age they need that time we all need that time just some quiet time to wind down from the day|agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh	you know	1
user:it is|user:yeah|user:right right	it is and	1
agent:i bought us tickets and stood there in line and i thought i'm going to end up on this elephant with him [laughter] you know he did it by himself so stuff like that is starting to come along where it's really getting fun you know but his day care has just done [vocalized-noise] just incredible stuff with him and he like comes home with something new everyday you know and so|user:oh that's great|user:you're kidding	[laughter]	0
user:uh-huh|agent:[vocalized-noise] it's Bright Steps in Louisville and whenever you say Bright Steps everybody goes oh i've heard that's the best day care in town you know and it's it's one of those that's very hard to get into and they have this this this woman owns three day cares two in Lewisville and one in Irving and she had to open the second one up in Lewisville because her waiting list was just like you know like a year old it was ridiculous and she's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other you know so its i mean she's|user:uh-huh	yeah good	1
user:uh-huh|agent:that's right and his old day care as much as i loved it you know and the owner i really liked her and she worked really hard to get good people but the people that she got were there because they weren't qualified to do anything else you know and and i got lucky and all of his teachers were very good|agent:that's right that's right	yeah	1
user:no yeah|agent:you know and there were places that were cheaper but is it you know your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money you know and i have peace of mind where he is and some of those other places i wouldn't have|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:yeah me too|user:yeah i know [vocalized-noise] eating out is a real treat for me because you know i [vocalized-noise] with two we have two children and|user:and	it costs so much to take the family out you know	0
agent:oh i know i know|user:yeah you can you can just make a meal out of the salad bar|agent:they've got a great salad bar too	and uh	0
user:uh-huh|agent:well when we lived in in Dallas uh unti[l]- up until last last year so uh we lived close to Addison so we w[ent]- went to a lot of places ov[er]- over there|user:so	oh	1
agent:have you ever been to Spring Creek Barbecue|user:uh|agent:yeah	uh i can't remember if my husband's taken me there or not my husband's probably gone there because_1 he works up	0
agent:before the two year [laughter-old] [laughter-came] along we we would go out once at least once a week a[nd]- and and uh|agent:well when we when we both worked before uh|user:no no	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:several places uh On The Border is okay but it is so expensive even at lunch time it's just not worth it|agent:i've been to	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:with ta[gging]- tagging the {kiddos} along you know|user:it is	oh i i have to agree there it	1
agent:and their pizza's not that good [laughter]|user:you might when you go|user:oh you're not kidding it i[s]- that's why we've only been there a couple times yeah that	no isn't that the truth you mi[ght]-	0
agent:yeah she is|user:child's probably too young isn't she|agent:hum	yeah so	1
user:well|user:yeah|agent:yeah	i think we've about discussed the [laughter-subject]	0
user:uh okay it depends on the kind of action it is and also depends on the state|agent:and a grand jury|user:um-hum	um you don't have to have a jury of twelve	0
agent:to go on and have the second one|agent:and they had had already had one trial and determined that there was enough evidence|user:um-hum	um okay	1
user:now it's possible they had another trial|user:and it's s[trange]- strange that there would have been a jury there because evidentiary hearings are u[sually]- are just before the judge|user:um	in which	1
agent:summons|agent:well they sent out eight hundred|user:what's that	um-hum	1
user:well it's it's hard to get out of jury duty i mean it's uh it's an obligation|agent:[noise]|user:yeah	on on each citizen	0
user:do you have any uh|user:uh uh they'll ask you questions like do you know the defendant have you heard anything about the case|user:i mean the thing is uh the easiest way to get out of one of these things is uh	specially if it's a murder case they may be asking for uh for a capital uh	0
agent:um-hum|user:and you know i that that to me that's always been a stupid question i- i mean i don't know i haven't heard the evidence yet [laughter]|agent:um-hum	i mean if if if he did something really really gross then yeah	1
agent:thing that we had to fill out|agent:[laughter] well now they're going to call people up after they've gone through this five page|agent:[laughter]	um-hum	1
user:well it may because it it's something that could have influenced your your your uh|user:yeah that that's|agent:but then i've heard that won't make a difference either	uh your uh your bias	0
user:well there's been all kinds of talk about it but quite honestly i don't think there's anything else that we could put in place that would work|agent:what do you think can we change the system|agent:well	as well i mean i- i realize it's cumbersome and uh	1
user:uh|user:i mean you see that's what it all comes down to it's the jury|user:y[ou]- you know if you've got if you've got a reasonable jury who will look at the evidence	if they are	1
user:but|user:as much|agent:uh-huh	on the other hand i mean again what what can be done about it you know	1
agent:[laughter]|user:you know how they are at that age i guess|user:and uh	you having been ten once	0
user:it seems almost as though|agent:um-hum|user:time we spend with our children	children hate it	1
agent:uh-huh|user:parents are a curse that they just have to live with|user:you know	so it it's interesting	1
agent:so you only have the you only have the stepdaughter at home you all don't have any|agent:yeah i'm sure it does|agent:yeah	yes	1
agent:um-hum|user:well i'm sure part of it is a male female thing you know i- i remember whenever|user:but i remember [laughter]	i was growing up	1
agent:yeah|user:well now the bank's not available|user:and it seems that	and entirely too much time is spent	1
user:well|agent:and i enjoy it but|user:[noise]	girls at that age	1
user:yeah if|agent:huh no i think not|user:so is that quality time	but there is camping and we both enjoy that	1
user:yeah but|agent:but i guess they learn from their friends don't they|user:oh yeah	well yeah and	1
agent:weird|agent:you know it's she just eats|agent:one week her daughter won't uh will be on a no meat kick and one week she'll eat nothing but Twix candy bars	and little girls are worse about it than little boys	1
agent:um-hum|user:oh yeah|agent:yeah oh is that where you're from	born in Denton raised in Lubbock	1
agent:yeah i'm sure she is|user:Jenny is a sweet kid|user:but	and	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:i mean w[hat]-|user:we were talking about how much it cost to go to Disney Land	golly	0
agent:oh|agent:that is awful high|agent:yeah	twenty bucks a whack now	1
agent:[laughter] really|user:God forbid Disney World would take forever|user:uh Disney Land or	or you'd have to pay air fare and	0
user:huh uh y[ou're]- you're the opposite of me i drive|agent:on newspaper combined with television|agent:i rely primarily on	an hour each way to work and so if i just use time and not in say one which quality is the best i g[uess]- that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio	0
user:some talk host|user:yeah i find it surprising because_1 a lot of times i[t]- here you know i'll talk to some people here and i'll mention someone's|agent:that's rather interesting	and uh i'll expect them to have an opinion uh well i don't like him and i don't listen they don't even know	1
user:well we do a lot of gardening here so there's we have an excellent gardener here has three hours on Sunday and three hours on Saturday|user:and talks about a lot of financial things but the here i just get a kick out of uh|user:remember the name Bruce Williams and he he is n[ational]- again national	course that's not exactly current events but	0
agent:uh|agent:uh other than that it was a [vocalized-noise] at best|user:[laughter] that's a good point that's a good point	oh yeah	0
user:my wife i you know it mentioned the the question was uh do you get it from people too and i i can say the same thing you do that uh|agent:uh and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of Raleigh than than the paper would have anyway|user:yeah you're right	my wife is uh she reads the paper from front to back and so she'll tell me some stuff and she'll always get mad and she'll say	0
user:uh because_1 uh|agent:okay|user:y[eah]- well it is CNN exactly	and it because uh	0
agent:uh almost an addiction uh and and we could equate|agent:sort of have household pact of let's turn the war off and and get something done|agent:uh we almost lived and and breathed it for because during the war itself to the point where we began to	yeah i i heard that yeah	1
user:[laughter]|agent:no not at all and yet long enough if we were calling back and forth it would be a toll call|agent:i [laughter-see] [laughter-okay]	it would	0
user:one time|user:yes one time|agent:have you ever served on a on a jury trial	but we found him innocent so	0
agent:sentencing|agent:uh|agent:come of their	um-hum	1
agent:they were really upset that he was getting off so lightly for the heinous crime that he had been involved in|agent:uh qualities and couldn't be rehabilitated and they were|agent:had no redeeming	oh	1
agent:y[eah]- i- i can see how that would be difficult|user:to decide|agent:oh	yeah to decide which day to take off and	0

agent:um a lot of these social welfare programs i mean that's why they're things like United Way is when you and i think that those are important but we give our dollars to them and it shouldn't be a government responsibility|user:i agree|agent:the art's in humanity should be privately funded	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:years to really get that in to order too|user:yeah it's it's it's an enormou[s]- [noise] enormous bureaucracy though it's going to take probably	[noise] because everybody will want that pet project	1
agent:yep|user:have a better budget for running this country is for everybody to get involved and right now i don't see that happening|user:uh probably will it's the only way it's going to change is for us to	not at the moment	0

agent:no it's not|user:of course you couldn't have known two to three years ago when you were making this decision what the taxes were going to do now the child care what you do pay doesn't not even worth a hill of beans on your tax return|agent:so it was	can't deduct it so what's it good for [laughter]	0
agent:um-hum|user:and that she does that on Thursdays and then occasional Saturday's and i can take off on those Thursday's and be home in time t[o]- for her to go off to work and it's cheaper for me to do that and take my vacation even if i uh|user:and come home on these Thursdays that she goes to work at uh eleven and get's off at seven thirty at night	take all thirteen weeks of summer	0

agent:um-hum|user:yeah [noise] well when we've painted um [noise] right now our house doesn't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there [noise] it's more trim because it has [noise] some of the old asbestos shingles on the back and there's some sort of stone or something in the front so there isn't as much|user:well	wood that has to be painted um [noise] but i[t]- it the problem is that it hits the sun hits it	0
agent:um-hum|user:the door frames|user:but they obviously had been done without to much uh wear afterward [noise] the only problem was when we started having the movers move the the uh furniture in we identified the various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood uh	when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it	1
EMPTY	so how do you feel about our policy in Latin [laughter-America]	1
user:um well they they should work their way they you know they should should be able to work their self out of it or you know why why why intervene in another country's you know problems and things like that why why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that|user:and it's like well uh you know i use to feel like|agent:uh-huh	but	1
user:you know or or is in complete opposition to it at least it's their choice as as long as long it's one that's|user:chooses a government that's not you know exactly the kind of government that we have|user:i wish we didn't have to i mean i- i'd rather even if a country	that that makes [laughter-sense] so to speak you know this is a government that stays in power that can stay in power but it seems like most of them don't	0
agent:well they they were feeding us [laughter] so uh|agent:Slovak countries and then on the other hand you have|agent:mistreating a lot of the uh	yeah	1
user:i don't mean to well i guess i do in a way sometimes i think a religion has a lot to do with that i think that|user:yeah well i mean|agent:are trying to make the country better	that uh because of those c[ountries]- countries a lot you know where such Catholic influence and i think the Catholic	0
agent:very very very close to Spanish|user:well Latin|agent:well they actually understood it is in America where it was hard [laughter] Latin they're you know	um they still didn't understand it though i don't think	0
agent:country and yet|agent:i mean you can say that about Africa too i think it has something to do with the poverty level because Africa is certainly not a Catholic uh|agent:you know much worse in the Latin American countries	um-hum	1
agent:{oopsy}|agent:so i think it is communication it's just|agent:very educated down there so	i think it maybe has to do with a lot uh a lot to do with education because	0
agent:in our country yeah|user:uh in our country|agent:[laughter]	yeah	1
user:and and pay pay some take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education|user:they're educating their people to higher degrees than we do so you're going to have to expect it so what you are you willing are you willing to compromise a little|user:you know and yet they yet people get very frightened when they see the Japanese moving in and the the Russians moving in in certain areas of technology you know that we use to dominate and it's like well you know	so	1
user:and she's|agent:ah my got my mom a teacup poodle not too long ago|agent:ah	[laughter]	0
user:so i've had this dog now for for sixteen years and she's been a lot of company|agent:oh yeah|user:you become attached to it [noise]	[noise] uh she's uh	1
agent:it's just it is just a great cat but|user:yeah|agent:you know	well my my personal preference is is a dog uh i don't know that uh that i'd ever want a cat oh i like cats i just wouldn't want to own one	0
agent:it decided that it was going to protest and so it jumped up on my bed and|agent:and uh did not feed it right away|agent:the next morning uh when my roommate got up and	[laughter]	1
user:so i took his suggestion and i|user:uh she wasn't she was dying and uh suggested that i take her to a working ho[spital]- dog hospital animal hospital|user:and uh she stayed there for one day and the doctor called me up and said uh she had a low white cell count and that	uh took the the dog to a hospital a dog hospital and they said that they'd keep her there for three days well she ended up staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because_1 she was in intensive care [laughter] [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] it cost me over five hundred [laughter-dollars]	0
user:and then the cat died|user:and she had the cat there for two days|user:the cat got sick so she took the cat to the vet	so the doctor had called her up and said	0
agent:for cats anyway you know|user:yeah|agent:only work initially	yeah	1
user:i think it's somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference and they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore because they feel like so many of the politicians are|agent:do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote|agent:okay well um	like crooked you know	0
agent:and now that was in fifty one that's forty years ago that it was already a problem so|user:um|agent:and how they were just giving away their marijuana giving away their heroin and what have you to get them started	God	1
agent:uh-huh|user:i mean it doesn't have to be it could be like a a sign that they would put down at the end of your block|user:the top neighborhood if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that you know	you know or anything like that but	0
user:maybe if they were brought up that a way like you said it would|user:he needs your vote just like he needs everybody elses you know|agent:that is	because i know here uh until you get into high school	0
agent:now some people object during primaries having to declare a party|user:yeah|agent:and that maybe maybe to think twice about voting	right	1
agent:well just the just the opportunity to try the voting machines yeah|user:where if they'd if they'd had a class or something or just a short|user:i didn't know how to work the machine you know and it really scared me really bad because i thought all these people are going to laugh at me because i don't know how to work this machine	time you know th[at]- that okay this is the way	1
agent:[noise] um the one th[e]- [vocalized-noise] the m[ost]- most valueless girl doesn't [laughter] but she's married now i i'm not quite sure why [laughter] i- i think he said that he'd give her a big ring and|agent:[laughter]|user:[laughter-have] a lot of values i love that [laughter] do they have children	[noise]	1
agent:oh|user:[noise] so you know and the last one that i picked was here uh the kids brought him over and said he was injured [noise] and it was winter time and i said i just cannot have another cat i just cannot have another cat [noise] and i looked out there and he was just laying on my lawn just shivering and all and i said i can't stand it [laughter-i] brought him in so [noise]|agent:oh i know	[noise] those are my children	0

agent:and she doesn't go far but she just wants to be able to have that freedom|user:yeah|agent:[laughter] oh them too [laughter] we[ll]- because_1 i he loves she's one of those that loves outside	yeah [noise] well if you're off off of a r[oad]- you know away from a road and	0
user:[laughter]|user:love it|agent:[laughter] i th[ink]- think she planned it she's only five but i think she [laughter-planned] [laughter] and she got all the attention from her dad [noise] wow oh yeah	oh say tha[t]- she needed that didn't she [noise] you know it must be hard when you have a lot of children i you know to ha[ve]- i was an only child my mother was an only child so i [vocalized-noise] you know i wasn't raised with [noise] brothers or sisters and i always got all the attention so i wouldn't know [noise] i think i would be extremely jealous or would have been [noise] had there [noise] been another child in the family	1
user:they have scraped the uh plaster off the walls you know with riding their little toys through it and stuff|user:we've got two children and it's|user:it's a two story house it it's a first home and it looks like it's going to be the last i think we're going to demolish [laughter-it]	you know	0
agent:[noise] it's what we have it's what we can afford|user:i know there's a lot of them_1|agent:[noise]	yeah	1
agent:oh yes|user:well then that's why you're doing this then isn't it|agent:oh no no i'm i work for TI	[laughter]	1
agent:public transportation|agent:buses and and uh|agent:lives on campus college student	uh-huh	1
agent:oh|user:and i mean all these people were standing up that was you know during the workday all along the cur[ve]- streets you know just|user:and i went down there a couple maybe three weeks ago for a trial [noise]	all around these vacant buildings there's a lot of vacant buildings	0
agent:well yeah it is|user:and i didn't realize when i moved here that it was a separate town from [laughter-Dallas]|user:something like that	[laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-i] [laughter-know] [laughter-now]	0
agent:with the local economy bad and TI and straits it seems that uh|agent:but now it seems that uh|user:uh-huh	it wasn't such a bad idea	1
agent:ours is wood s[ided]-|agent:mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one|agent:well	that was in the seventies	1
user:yeah|agent:it was already setup when we bought it|user:[noise]	[noise] well i bet it's not bad	1
user:so if the economy gets better are you going to get another one|agent:so you know there's not that much time left on the loan and|user:gee nice huh [noise] [laughter] that sounds good	another house	1
agent:uh|agent:a stand that would not totally ban guns but would certainly very much control them_1|agent:well i think uh i think on a scale of one to ten i would be i would be more toward a uh a uh uh an	i agree	1
agent:uh but i'm sure that they get a lot of publicity there's probably a lot of people that get shot with guns by equally mentally [laughter-deranged] [laughter-people]|user:um-hum|agent:uh that's probably why i've come to that to that way of thinking of course the uh the very emotional uh thinking over what happened to President Reagan you know the guy that got it was mentally deranged since you get one so easily	well um just recently i think it was Sunday on Sixty Minutes	0
user:uh-huh|agent:yeah and and that requires some that would be at the federal level and require some waiting period presumably uh during that waiting period there would be a background uh uh check that would take place|user:i didn't know about that	[noise]	1
agent:guy some money for a gun|agent:and i'll bet they don't i'll bet you don't i- i would imagine legitimate gun dealers you'd have background checks but i'll bet if somebody goes in and offers a pawnshop|user:uh-huh	enough money that's right	1
agent:yeah i- i- i think that you know people have legitimate reasons for having them_1 the only problem is so many people have them_1 that don't have legitimate reasons for having them And the other thing is that there are a lot of crimes of passion|user:right [laughter]|agent:yeah that the only way that would be a disadvantage if the other guy's got a gun and fires when he sees his and it's on it's on the first shot uh i think that uh uh	[noise] yeah	1
agent:i- i think we're almost coming from the same place on this subject really i- i- i- i think that that we don't want to go to the extreme of banning them completely but we sure want a lot of control then and a lot of protection|agent:and and uh so i- i uh|user:oh my gosh	yeah i do too	1
agent:um-hum|user:well i in my younger years i'd always heard the adage you should uh buy as much of a house as you can afford|user:yeah	uh because of the uh improvement in real estate prices	0
user:so far we've managed to hold our own by uh|user:but uh|agent:yeah	trying to set up a	0
agent:you know like JC Penny's in our [laughter] in our budget|agent:we don't have a lot of uh|agent:you know those kinds of things uh	yeah	1
agent:wow|agent:oh|user:at this point to uh to buffer that	and	1
agent:things like that all the time|agent:you know just|agent:that would really hurt us financially and	um-hum	1
agent:wow|user:i tried uh|user:and uh	this past year	0
agent:oh no|agent:wow|agent:oh wow	and get them a whole new set of playthings	1
user:uh we're primarily in the uh|agent:what do you all make|agent:i see	uh systems integrations business	1
user:yeah|agent:i think it you know it probably was a good movie i just uh really didn't get into it that much but uh everybody i've talked to has just loved it and they want to go back and see it you know two or three times|user:i don't know from all i've read about it i- i really think [vocalized-noise] i'd like to see it	really	1
agent:pretty predictable towards the end but uh i still thought it was a good movie|agent:it was|user:really	yeah i definitely want to see that have you seen uh The Doors	1
agent:plus a lot of movies you need to sort of see them_1 in a theater you know it just makes them that much better|agent:that's true that's t[rue]-|user:well uh yeah with the dollar theater though i it's sometimes it's cheaper to pay a dollar to see it than to you know to pay it depends on where you rent your videos but	yeah i'm glad that	1
agent:but uh i've heard the scenery is real good in it yeah|user:and uh|agent:right	really i've heard a lot of good things about it but	0
agent:do s[omething]- i don't really know what all it was|agent:i don't know in a rest home or something and then they go off and|agent:and he's	yeah i think i've seen you know	0
agent:yeah|user:oh he's got a blue tongue|agent:more Collie and Shepherd than Chow the only Chow he's got is is his tongue	oh	1

agent:hesitant about bringing a puppy in to adult cats i think they would socialize easier|agent:um|user:yeah	[noise] right	1
user:yeah he is he's a big old thing|agent:oh i bet the black one's pretty|user:uh the female's red and the male is black	and um i was concerned about the female mainly	0
user:she's just like um|user:but um like our miniature Schnauzer she's just|agent:yeah yeah	a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly	0
agent:yeah|user:the big white|agent:now are the are the cockatoos are those the big ones	birds with the	0
user:i don't know those f[ish]- fish are just beautiful|user:right i don't blame you there i think the saltwater are a lot more attractive than|agent:[vocalized-noise] i really do[n't]- i really don't care much for them	just it's like you have a little bit of	1
user:[noise]|agent:they're always up where they don't where they're not supposed to be|user:oh no oh no	[noise] yes yeah and that's hard	1
agent:and i we knew it but we never even thought that about when we got the dog we just saw him oh he's so cute let's take him home [laughter] you know and then the first weekend we had him we had we were in a apartment in a two bedroom apartment|user:that's right that is hard|user:um-hum [laughter]	oh yes	1
agent:paper training and you know teaching him commands and stuff so this was and to me a whole new experience [laughter] only it wasn't like cats at all|agent:him and i wasn't really involved in th[e]- the the|user:[noise] um-hum	sure yeah	1
user:[laughter]|agent:that they think is good they'll get into the trash an[d]- then it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it and how how tight you have the lid down on it they'll get into it|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:i have noticed since uh|user:i've uh changed wi[per]- wiper blades or something but|agent:um-hum	i got married that my husband	1
user:everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it so he thought well i can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars which he did|user:and so he priced around and|agent:[laughter]	and then	0
agent:you know i had to do that job and of course that was back in December when it's nice and cold outside [laughter]|agent:and you're required to get your car to go through the emission test well my muffler of course starting going bad right before i was supposed to go to the emission test so|user:um-hum	yes i'm sure it was	1
user:he does not|user:generally i think he|user:so he gets some satisfaction out of that although	look forward to or anticipate there's some people that enjoy	0
agent:i'll take it to him to do it|agent:and so it and if i have something that's really major that i can't handle or feel i don't have the time to handle|agent:and uh he's about uh sixty miles from here	right you know that it's uh really has a bad reputation is to feel that	0
user:that's really really good so he went in and uh but when|user:but we saw a commercial for like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change he said|user:he had looked at it himself and	they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something anyway but the car that the muffler people had um	0
user:and be functional now|user:and he thought that turned out pretty good because it you know it helped him to understand|agent:yeah	and it helped him to have a close relationship so	1
user:you know|user:um|user:that's willing to do it i go ahead and let them do it i don't feel the need to	be a feminist on that issue and say i can take care of my own things	0
user:it's a good experience it helps you feel i think comfortable with your car and feel like|agent:it was something di[fferent]- a little different|agent:i mean she'd always assisted me and done some other things but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was uh	it's	0
agent:but still you know the the element of trust was gone at that point|agent:he'll meet me halfway i'll meet him halfway so i had it all all this work done for like two hundred and fifty dollars|agent:yeah so i thought well	yeah that's their way of capturing your	1
agent:yeah|user:generally try to find my own personal car mechanics|user:well i	uh rather than taking it to a shop i'm kind of like you it's	1
agent:what kind of car you got|user:and that's all the major problems i've had for a vehicle that's got eighty nine thousand miles|user:that needed replacing	it's a Nissan	1
user:and i've had to replace a set of tires a couple times|user:then the other problem too is just a fuel filter and the fuel pump|user:but	but that was due to	0
user:i had uh|agent:hum|user:and uh that happened to me twice before i caught on well enough to wh[at]- what happened	one tire	0
user:you're you're saving about uh ten bucks by doing it yourself but|user:yeah|agent:it's just it probably costs me at least six seven eight dollars to do it myself i figure for an extra ten dollars let them take [laughter-care] of it	what the heck if you can afford it	1
agent:these repair people say oh you need need your your your your your your this and your that's gone out and it's like good grief i don't even know what they do|agent:and uh other things were going out on it you know and|agent:uh	um-hum	1
agent:but these people were telling me that they needed to be replaced|agent:they you know they were kind of loose and so|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
user:yeah i|agent:that's all i got to say [laughter]|agent:oh well	don't have that much problems so [noise] with my vehicle knock on wood	1
agent:um-hum|user:the thing about it is like the Panamanians is a lot of servicemen down there a lot of a lot even our American servicemen are involved|agent:[noise] right	because_1 i guess there was a big big uh scam	0
user:i mean they uh|user:soldiers are there but there's a lot|user:and there's a lot of Amer[ican]- i don't know how many American uh	uh and you can't the American government you can't trust them either	0
agent:that's how we got into a problem if we got them we have sink them in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars that common sense you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back|agent:and stayed i've been there twice and stayed and that wa[s]- that was just really sad but a lot of it though is their debt i think that we should not loan them anymore money that if we still want to give them money give them money quit loaning it to them_1 you're not going to get it back don't be indebted to anybody don't be the you know loaner nor borrower and it's just not good we need to if we feel like we need to give them_1 money then give it to them but quit loaning all the money out which i don't think we're loaning anymore now but|agent:and i have another friend from uh Costa Rica that she was born there she's Costa Rican i guess i do know a little bit i went to Mexico City one time	yeah also uh uh Mexico	0
user:is it|agent:i don't think there are the little box is black on the top of the pyramid of the sun it's black so yeah you can't really tell but it is kind of weird you know you think wow there is where they did human sacrifices to false Gods and|agent:[noise]	do you get spooked you feel or do you get butterflies in your stomach when you go there because	1
user:every month my husband uh goes to the credit union and withdraws|user:coming from that background what we pretty much do is we our household as far as living expenses we live on a cash budget|agent:um okay	you know X amount of dollars for the month and then that money is used during that month we have a certain budget	0
user:so we our budgets are realistic and they are not|agent:uh-huh|user:but uh we've gotten pretty good at it we've been doing it for a couple of years now	so stringent as you know to make us feel uncomfortable	0
user:uh have to worry about because of insurance and|user:most of our medical things we don't|user:well uh	they're they're relatively small uh we've been lucky in the past we didn't have that problem but right now we don't for the other things the things that do crop up that we aren't really expecting we have different funds set aside for different things like we have a car fund and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not	0
user:uh we have a lot of different things right now we save about twenty five percent|agent:or like what what percent do you then save or something|user:in our	of our um of our pay	1
agent:and but that hasn't always been the case [laughter] so i'm kind of i feel at least better now that i have finally gotten some of those things uh|user:right that's good|agent:you know so it isn't any extended uh it may be that i picked up something at the uh store but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then so it's not any you know uh build up on the charge cards at all	[laughter]	1
agent:uh-huh|user:some months it may be different it's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves you know down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing|user:and um mean some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else and	but the way we set up you know the amount that we want to save and	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and uh on special occasions i mean birthdays and things like that we|user:but again it's a set amount every month	we don't	0
agent:[laughter]|user:i mean jeez they are one and four [laughter]|user:that's how i feel about sometimes about my kids' education	we have got a long time to save up my husband he's the real	0
agent:huh|user:and that's all he has he has a ten dollar bill|agent:oh	and i mean so i'd say at least	0
agent:um i have a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian|user:what type|agent:three cats	okay i'm trying to i don't know the first two the Himal[ayans]-	1

agent:[laughter]|agent:[laughter]|user:they're almost more like dogs one's name is Malcolm and he sort of follows you from room to room	wherever you go and things like that so it's really really cute	1
user:and uh but he was fun one time i was cooking chicken and i|agent:yeah|user:yeah he was a real wild one	make taken all the chicken breasts off the bones and i had this whole stack of nice chicken breasts up there and he jumped from the floor probably about four and a half feet high	0
agent:Kitty Cat they'll be playing and Kitty Cat will jump on her and Sheba will just turn around and throw her to the floor get on top of her and|agent:that's right|user:she be she gets back at kitty cat for all the hassle	oh	1
agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:it's impossible|user:oh yeah	people have them_1 and they're out walking them_1 on the street but i don't think it's fair to the animals	1
agent:yeah|user:but do you breed them the first time they go into heat|agent:she'll be going into heat probably around uh July or August	well	1
user:you [vocalized-noise]|user:to get|agent:[noise] um not too awfully uh uh She[ba]- Sheba cost us uh two hundred dollars	that's not that bad but you certainly want to protect them	1
agent:i have the stuff there i don't have the motivation all the time|user:you have the stuff there [laughter]|user:[laughter] well it sounds like you're	yeah	1
agent:wha[t]- you you just have to be really really careful about what you eat you can you can eat like a normal person if you get a moderate amount of exercise and not really have to worry about it|agent:because if you don't exercise then it seems like um|agent:but you can	yeah	1
agent:that's really good|user:yeah|user:uh-huh	i i think it's you know at first it	0
agent:you know it's just in bad shape|agent:i i if i had l[ost]- if i lost ten pounds i'd think of myself as nice and thin but uh most of it is just|agent:oh my muscles are horrible that's the main reason i really ought to be doing something like that because_1 mine's not so so much uh weight i mean i have	yeah	1
agent:do you go right after wor[k]-|user:ten or fifteen or twenty minutes each way i probably would quit doing it|user:if i had to go you know several miles if it took me	no uh in fact that's	1
agent:um-hum|user:uh mostly you know with the winter months and all it|user:well my husband and i were also doing quite a bit of walking but we got off of that a little bit	seems like there are too many	0
user:[laughter]|agent:well uh it's too bad we can't talk about your other interests but we just have to talk [laughter-about] [laughter-exercise]|agent:yeah	well	1
agent:you know maybe the two of y'all i mean if he had come on let's go or you you know and y'all kind of did it together in a way that helps|user:well yeah|agent:you know keep your motivation level up too i think sometimes might help so i was thinking maybe your husband would	yeah it it helps a lot with the walking because otherwise it's just plain boring	1
user:no me either [laughter]|agent:no i'm definitely [laughter] now i do like to walk|user:well how about you are you an exercise fanatic	do you	1

user:right|user:[noise] right|agent:the victims and and the citizens of Texas	no yeah they do need to to drastically do something uh about the whole works because uh it's obvious especially with the introduction of drugs now that crime is is there's	0
agent:the penalty assessed is death period|agent:if he if he had enough snap to do that he knew what he was doing|user:yeah	um-hum well	0
user:[laughter-oh] [laughter-no]|agent:he run across a man's file that was like on death row for nine years before they finally got around to executing him|agent:i think that you know of the the uh	i mean look at them	1
user:and uh you know get that stuff out of the way and if it's turned down th[e]-|user:so that they'd have enough time for an appeal|user:statutes of limits and ever[ything]- all that other stuff you know they they should have like within one year	the you know after that if if two people have said it then two is enough [laughter]	0
user:[noise] i don't know it is uh|user:so|user:if your if you uh you know have done this or if you need this uh uh we'll sue for you and you don't have to pay us unless you but then what they don't tell you is that if you if they win you give them at least a third of the of [laughter-the] thing that they win	it's getting to be more business now rather than	0

user:right|agent:they're not going to worry about it because they're going to be packing their own heat and they're going to take care of business themselves|agent:get to such an extent where the average American citizen if they see a crime go down or a crime is happening against them they're not going to worry about trying to get a policeman	although you know uh [laughter] that uh it's kind of a catch twenty two because if you defend yourself or as there was a case where this uh fellow in Baltimore kept having his store broken into uh through a vent in the cei[ling]- in the ceiling uh the roof	0
user:it it seems unfortunate and a little frustrating because it seems like we have citizens the there isn't much we can do um|user:it['s]- it's wrong your right [laughter] um i|user:uh it's	you try to hope	0

user:ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed but good thing they had their gun on them and they|user:and maybe they just don't report those or i'm not sure or you know i can't think of|agent:um i	they thwarted the robbery attempt	1
agent:and so that was really the only experience that i've had with guns and it it kind of scared me|user:oh jeez|agent:and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere [laughter]	right	1
agent:yeah that's true|user:now of course you know in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want|user:a uh a handgun	but i guess to make it more	0
agent:you know and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on in L A on the freeways and then you come here in in the Dallas area|user:uh-huh|agent:to me it is more like [vocalized-noise] vigilantism	right	1
agent:okay what kind of music do you like|agent:[noise]	well i um	0
agent:um-hum|user:songs that were popular back when i was paying attention|agent:um-hum	and then i like some classical music	1
agent:so lots of times i'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio actually|user:um-hum|user:[laughter]	[noise]	1
agent:oh yeah|user:and uh they try to tend to try to do outdo each other with raciness i think and|agent:[laughter]	so i you know i'm not attracted to that at all but um it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was	0
agent:a CD player and then start collecting CDs and it just i haven't gotten around to doing it yet|agent:i sure don't because i have so many albums and cassettes i feel like gosh i have to go out and buy|agent:no i don't	uh-huh	1
user:you can't record on them|user:well i can't imagine um|agent:right	and so	0
agent:so i can record some things from her and you know get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if i want to but|user:well that's good|agent:um	um-hum	1
user:a lot of things and a lot of the|user:you know i just didn't want them to be exposed to|user:activities because um	lot of the songs have some lyrics that um	0
user:yes i know what you mean i- i know my husband he|agent:don't bother to do it very much anymore|user:[laughter]	um	0
agent:um-hum oh i'm sure it is i'm sure it is i was exposed to a lot of music when i was younger i|user:activities and he thinks that'd be good for the [laughter-kids] [laughter]|user:concert band type	[laughter]	1
agent:yeah don't blame her|agent:uh-huh so she took it with her [laughter]|user:yeah she she uh she uses it now uh my sister to actually she moved and my father wasn't using it she [noise] took it with her	[noise]	0
user:i know some people who just they just went through a course uh|agent:um and i guess it if you're doing that sort of thing it's really useful but [noise] um unless it is i guess it's kind of a waste|user:yeah	and took the electronic grafting course	0
agent:right|user:you couldn't really wear a coat because it was so hot and then again i picked up a cold|agent:yeah	[noise]	0
user:[laughter]|agent:not quite as powerful|agent:[noise] and it's not quite as um as useful	yeah	1
agent:this has been fun talking to you|user:okay good|agent:well i guess we've spent our time i need to go help my daughter do something so	okay	0
user:uh yours in place of it|user:that if you take someone else's life then you automatically are giving up|user:is uh it kind of depends on the crime that's committed my belief all my life i guess has been that	but i don't	0
user:uh|agent:oh is that|user:but i lean towards if it's premeditated or if it's	kind of a habitual or or a habit that uh	0
user:uh a lot of time|agent:oh yeah|user:are really pretty slim right now and you can probably spend	[noise] uh or maybe eventually	0
user:sh[e]-|user:right|agent:also indirectly by that indirect involvement it's just it's it's ridiculous	she is she is an emotional victim	1
agent:no it's upper middle class uh kind of an environment it's a|user:[laughter] no that's okay [laughter]|agent:oh well God it sounds like [laughter] sounds like i'm bragging [laughter]	okay	1
user:um|agent:um-hum|user:well no not really [laughter]	the area itself uh the Fort Worth Dallas area um has	0
agent:and so uh overbuilding is i[t]- it has been a real problem there|user:wow|agent:is phenomenal compared to the population	um	1
user:uh for probably|agent:right|user:like two or three styles you could choose from [laughter] and and uh that's pretty much all the houses in the area [laughter]	a square mile i'd say at least	0
agent:now it was very nicely done|user:um|agent:for two bedroom which is essentially a two bedroom apartment	yeah	0
agent:it's it's really sad [laughter]|user:that's [laughter] [vocalized-noise]|agent:you know so	yeah [laughter]	1
agent:do you i drive a Honda Accord [laughter-yeah]|user:i drive a Honda Prelude and|user:[vocalized-noise]	oh [laughter-yeah]	0
agent:oh really i hadn't heard that|user:supposedly real reliable the only thing i've ever heard about Hondas is that the breaks go out first|user:i it's and it's	yeah	0
agent:right|user:so i don't f[eel]- feel comfortable in traffic with it|agent:right	and for everything i've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic	1
user:um-hum|agent:but i really like the Hondas i like foreign cars a lot|user:yeah	yeah	1
agent:oh yeah i have to have them_1 loaded i- i love all those little things that you [laughter-don't] need but they're so wonderful|agent:oh yeah|agent:they're nice i think	i mean [laughter]	1
agent:i don't know why|user:yeah|agent:the warranties and things like that just i can't seem to get over that that just bothers [laughter-me]	well um like on Hondas	1
user:bye-bye|user:okay well i enjoyed talking to you|agent:i guess that's all	[noise]	1
agent:yeah|user:i guess [laughter-we'll] [laughter-find] [laughter-out]|agent:okay	so in Maryland are you uh are you a Skins fan	1
user:and uh|agent:now oh okay|user:yeah i'm i'm in Dallas	uh i guess when you're down here in Dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the Cowboys	0
agent:um-hum|user:but they would go out and try to go for uh the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche|user:and didn't really put them_1 draft for any particular spot	and then about five years ago four or five years ago uh they started going after uh uh specific players or positions	0
agent:they don't have anything high do they [laughter]|user:uh they still have some some uh some draft picks uh that they got|agent:um i just you know um Cowboys are going to have a problem aren't they is it is it this year they don't have a draft pick because of the Walker trade or what was the whole deal on that	no ac[tually]- actually they picked up some from Minnesota	0
agent:um-hum|user:but i- i guess uh when you have a whole bunch of uh professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody's got great hopes|agent:um-hum	you know i guess it's the same way with baseball or or anybody you know spring training until you actually start going out and getting uh getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good	1
agent:you know the the one the griping is that if you know if if Washington doesn't get a uh a baseball team then Baltimore shouldn't get a football team which is probably true but anyway um i just i've never liked DC a whole lot and i really hate the Redskins|user:jeez|user:oh okay	well course	1
agent:know uh was coach of the year and the second was this phone call from Buddy Ryan i've got fired can you believe that [laughter]|agent:um you|agent:and uh he had this cartoon in there about Jimmy Johnson's big day you know the first thing is the phone call from the you know from the league saying he was uh	[laughter] uh jeez	0
agent:next year this little|agent:um it's opening|agent:yeah well they've they've built a new baseball stadium downtown	is that near near the what do they c[all]- i forgot the name of it is it the	0
user:jeez|agent:left to go go there of all places [laughter]|agent:and um i was not real happy when uh when they uh	yeah so uh uh	0
agent:okay i think LA Law|user:it's okay you can get started there|agent:oh i'm sorry [laughter]	oh that's probably what i was going to say	1
user:[laughter-okay]|agent:bad because i understood all of it [laughter]|agent:[noise] it was pretty b[ad]-	i- i can't say i'm that much of a faithful Dallas follower maybe it's [laughter-because_1] because_1 i live here and i know how {hokey} it [laughter-is] i don't know	1
agent:yeah those TV movies or something|user:of course they're uh they're probably going to set it up for some kind of sequel or something in the future and uh [laughter]|user:yeah	yeah it's got to come back	1
agent:well i|user:well what do you think about what's going on on LA Law this year it's|user:it's hard to imagine	have you seen it the past couple of weeks	1
user:and the rest of the partners all got up in arms about it|agent:yeah|user:reign as a senior partner	and Michael met with them and said and said you know we got to do something about this we need to make a proposal let somebody else be the leader and he kind of elected himself	0
user:they're fighting out that battle now he's firm formed his own firm|agent:really|user:so they fired him they chased him off with the security guards	he uh	1
user:and he took um i can't remember the guy the guy he defended for murder|user:yeah and he he went to uh he went to the bank|agent:really	Earl	0
user:because_1 the bank gave him apparently some extra credit because they had that lien|user:so he did away with that and then he went to the bank|user:so that they cut that out so they they couldn't have a lien on his house anymore	well since they didn't have the lien anymore they couldn't have the credit from the bank so that	0
user:and um|user:so they ended up both being in court in front of the judge pleading their case|user:Leland was going to try a motion make a motion before that	i think i think Michael was doing it on the one hand and the guy that do you remember the guy that that uh Grace had an affair with the other lawyer	0
user:and and both parties had to come up with with lists of people that were suitable to to run it|agent:uh-huh|user:and he was going to put it in the hands of a businessman to to run it and see if the firm was salvageable or not	[noise] and he rejected both of the lists and came up with his own person	1
agent:Roxanne the the secretary|user:<b_aside> was it Roxanne <e_aside>|user:you'll never get it [laughter-it's] it's uh	Roxanne's ex-husband	1
user:and uh|user:Susan Dey and|user:who is it i guess it's	whoever plays Kuzak isn't coming back next year so	0
agent:that that's a weird marriage|agent:oh|user:[laughter] so it's just kind of weird	yeah	1
agent:so we've started recycling our uh plain white paper|agent:a lot of paper that gets thrown away here|agent:starting with my work um we're in a uh aluminum can and paper recycling um i work for TI and there's a uh	um-hum	1
user:uh|user:because there just cannot always be landfills|agent:um-hum	my	1
agent:they've got a way to recycle them_1 they've got places that can recycle them_1 into products no problem|user:um-hum|agent:is plastic milk cartons	um-hum	1
agent:if they started billing people by the pound things might change drastically|user:right|agent:and once they do that then people will be more interested right now it doesn't matter how much garbage you put out to the road it's a flat fee a month	um-hum	1
agent:get out the fuel at the other end|agent:reduces the amount of fuel that's required in order to|agent:i mean it it control you know it it [vocalized-noise] controls its own process it burns it	um-hum	1
agent:uh tank|agent:that came out from the process in a measuring cup turned around and poured it right back into the|agent:i saw it on the evening news and um the guy actually took the oil	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|agent:and then we're going to have problems with our water and then it's going to cause health problems and so there is a long-term effect and when you stop and think about it every just about every single thing that's produced can be recycled|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
user:because|user:i kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children|user:well Brent i've been um	i thought uh if it it's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school	0
user:that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time|agent:uh-huh|user:so i think one day one of our kids said you know someone came home and they said well when is dad leaving or something it was like that they thought that's the way life was	and so i think um it's become real important to me that	0
agent:yes what a coincidence [laughter]|user:oh you are|agent:so am i	[laughter] yes and	1
agent:two girls|user:hum|agent:and my youngest is about to turn three	uh-huh	1
agent:[laughter] that's how it is at our house when you're on the phone oh it's open|user:everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now|agent:right	but uh it's yeah	1
user:with them and um|agent:right|agent:right	but it's hard for him on Saturdays he he wants	1
agent:and uh you don't have quite as much money when when the wife doesn't work|agent:and for them that's wonderful you know they they they thought it was the greatest fun you know and it didn't cost any money|agent:and the kids got to go around and you know see pigs and animals and things like that and	well that's right	0
agent:and a mother isn't an important|user:um-hum|agent:what a waste people think you know you should be fulfilling yourself and	that's right and	1
agent:yeah|user:well i see that we both share the same belief here that|agent:um-hum	it's important that we spend time with our kids and and	0
agent:and so uh that it's kind of a seasonal thing three times a year she's really busy doing certain things|agent:part time|user:well that's good	um-hum	1
user:i i it's hard to say what caused it i mean you know if if the regulations hadn't been uh|user:you know|agent:yeah	hadn't been relaxed maybe it wouldn't have happened but i somehow think it still would have	0
user:i i wonder if there's not a little bit of overzealousness there uh you know they say well this one went under because of bad energy loans bad real estate loans|agent:yeah|user:yeah i that that's the part of it i couldn't understand i mean	and then they go around classifying everybody as bad	0
user:yeah|user:yeah|user:exactly	yeah the	1
agent:really sort of disturbed me|user:yeah|user:and then it	yeah and then and then some some rich yo-yo walks in there who's buddies with the bank president saying look i want to borrow	0
agent:uh-huh|user:i mean i mean the way things are going people are more and more working out of their homes i know a lot of people who do lawyers doctors|agent:yeah	uh architects consultants	0
agent:um-hum|user:systems design i mean you name it he does that|user:oh	and then i handle the mail order and whatever else we do we do cat breeding [laughter] [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] [laughter-yeah]	0
user:um|agent:uh-huh|user:and they will take the risk on a home business	there's i m[ade]- i made a few contacts through CompuServe	0
user:no i i'm i'm i'm leery of it i know that's the way it works|user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter] that's not too great	um	1
user:yeah|agent:it's a computer business|user:yeah what what business do you do	yeah my uh my roomie is down in Charlotte right now he's got an internship down at IBM	0
user:[laughter]|agent:i see|user:and he signed up for it and then of course he moved off to Charlotte so now i'm stuck making his calls too [laughter] [noise]	gosh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:[laughter-you] [laughter-know] a nicer way of saying you talked too long|agent:yeah yeah	but anyway if you need to get going we'll we'll terminate	1
user:yeah|agent:as far as as as any further involvement until the UN sanctions it in fact [vocalized-noise] it really was to begin with|user:um-hum	yeah	1
agent:that's right|agent:yeah|user:yeah and it's certainly and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years and it's going to continue	as long as you have so many diverse groups that are that are vying for power it's going to happen all the time	1
agent:this is a holy war and it is right and then uh we we go on from there|agent:you know by by self-proclamation|agent:it's it's religious based and uh	yeah	1
agent:okay|user:tha[t's]- that's that's it a lot of the time i- i was stationed in in Turkey for for a year and a half|agent:what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases and it's	and it it was	0
user:i uh|user:yeah|agent:absolutely	i- i guess you work for TI	0
agent:and uh it it it bites us over and over again the the|user:um-hum|user:um	yeah and until we until we start changing our educational system i mean	0
agent:yeah|user:and he's from the Philippines|user:um	and	0
agent:yeah bec[ause]- you know ev[ery]- every the the country's got a problem with uh with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that and the long long range views are are just kind of become a thing of the past|user:we're we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later|user:i don't know it's to me it's amazing i don't know what we're going to do as a country	um-hum	1
agent:no absolutely|user:at a price tag of six thousand bucks i don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers|user:well	be[cause]- uh now i have the i- i have the IBM PS two	0
agent:we're we we fight that that battle every day here at work uh|user:yeah|user:um-hum it's already outdated	yeah yeah i- i can imagine	0
agent:and um so i've been assembling it and haven't had a chance to get out there and and test it out [laughter]|agent:well um i just bought a home so i've just now went out and purchased my brand new lawn mower|user:uh are you big into lawn and garden work	well do you is it a new house or	1
agent:um-hum|user:just we sort of made a little garden that uh surrounded the trees|user:uh	and planted uh pachysandra	1
user:and for the back i would uh|agent:um-hum|agent:uh-huh	vacuum them up and then put them_1 on a tarp and drag the tarp out front to	0
user:um-hum|agent:so i'm just thinking how in the world i was going to have to scrape up all those uh acorns that are sitting out there they even have some little trees growing because they just left them the acorns i guess sit|agent:uh	yeah	1
agent:um-hum wow|agent:um-hum|user:and fertilizers and mulch and everything else	and it's it's not hard to go through the money doing that	1
agent:but still sort of up in that general|user:so uh|user:one lives in Connecticut and a couple lives in Pittsburgh and one lives near DC	yeah	0
agent:oh uh-huh|user:Owens|agent:oh what which one is that	um	0
user:that type of thing and that didn't work but but somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did|agent:uh-huh|user:and trying to sell it to farmers for bedding for their animals	for straw	0
agent:well it sounds like they're doing quite a bit|user:uh|agent:uh-huh	well we're working hard on it because we're fighting also in our area a large	0
agent:uh Texas Instruments|user:and what is TI|agent:know all of them_1 but	oh okay	0
agent:you know which things are the right ones i mean i i'll frequently have to look at the list if it's something that i don't throw away all the time|user:hum|agent:even some of those can have plastic tabs on them so it's it's hard to kind of figure out	um	1
agent:whereby they pick it up from your alley uh one day a week and all you have to do is bundle it|user:um-hum|agent:and they have initiated a newspaper recycling	um-hum	1
agent:and used to travel up there to Knox quite a bit and and i even did once when i was a child you know|user:oh for heaven's sake|user:yeah	yeah	1
user:that they should give businesses more incentives|user:and uh we we just we just don't want it anyplace [laughter] we feel that we|agent:um	to do more recycling and more reduction and	0
user:right|agent:cost to them because obviously no one wants to spend a lot of money|user:um-hum um-hum	right	1
user:[vocalized-noise] yeah|agent:i uh that's their marketing|user:no but they think and probably the right people buy it	yeah	1
agent:uh-huh|user:things of that sort and it seems to me that it's it's not a totally bad idea but i don't quite see how they'd make it work|user:uh various other	how would they decide who goes into	0
agent:uh-huh|user:paying them uh sorting them out assigning them training them|user:but i just really think that the difficulties involved in	would be insurmountable	1
agent:in different situation you know not a really religious background if if i would get a lot out of it you know i think i did because it you know it emphasized that sort of thing you know a lot of|agent:but i don't know if i was doing it|user:uh-huh	sure	1
user:[laughter] [laughter]|agent:be able to take care of them [laughter] so that's yeah so that may not may not benefit them in the long run|user:that's true [laughter] good point	oh	1
user:his home mortgage how much he pays for it what his payments are|user:finding out this particular pers[on]- from this particular person|user:it detailed how this one person went about	uh his uh social security number driver's license any kind of records he may have uh their credit card and the status of their credit	1
agent:right|user:not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody i s[uppose]- suppose because it you can easily be overheard overheard|agent:you don't really have any privacy at all	and they get i suppose any items that you have	0
user:but um|agent:yeah|user:it's i suppose it depends on who you're working for and where at	my own environment is open totally there are no cubicles	1
user:the big advent of that i believe because|user:the computer is the|user:record or	it they can all hold such	1
user:if if everybody bands together it's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that's serving in the office|user:uh the only way it can change is um|agent:what do you think could be done about it	the only thing really that can be changed is for us to everybody to say we've had enough of you out you go but	1
user:obtain information and|user:we're we're able to|user:i suppose country insofar as	i wouldn't	1
agent:then you know to get it removed they say well you know you have to write this write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them you know and then it takes three weeks and all and i'm like baloney|agent:because they're and then they want|agent:and that that just drives me crazy	um-hum	1
agent:[laughter]|agent:[laughter-yes]|user:i guess i've just about run out of	i- i can probably go on but [laughter]	1
user:it hasn't really been that long but my my uh the last movie i saw was on TV|user:i don't know|user:well	uh and i was trying to rememb[er]- it was called Back Stab	0
agent:yeah|user:i'll think of it in a minute|user:the dirty uh	yeah he wa[s]- it was really good i just thought that was great	1
agent:um|user:and uh [noise] do you know any of the characters|agent:hm	Ellen	0
user:and uh|agent:oh that's weird|agent:oh like a ghost	oh i'm telling you i just cried and cried and cried and cried it was so s[weet]- it was sweet but it was sad because_1 you know you just really miss Gary	1
agent:they're they're full you know they're for adults they're not just kids cartoons they're|agent:but uh there all there all fun to watch|agent:um	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:[noise]	um what is your experience been with like do you have elderly relatives that live with you or have lived with your parents or something like th[at]-	1
user:but they put him in a nursing home|agent:um-hum|user:control type of things i- i mean i don't know if he ever really got violent	and actually the problem	0
agent:oh my gosh|user:and they found out it wasn't even his electrocardiogram that there was some other patient you know by the time he'd been sent back to the nursing home and|agent:yeah	under care there	1
agent:oh really|user:an area that when she moved down there was mostly elderly people [vocalized-noise] well not|user:and in some ways i think for her might have even been better because_1 she used to live in	you know it was like a community of apartments that	0
agent:an[d]- and um|user:uh-huh well i'm sure|agent:and h[is]- like his other par[ents]- grandparents on his other side both were in a nursing home and his grand[mother]- his other g[randmother]- his dad's mother finally went into a coma and she was in a coma for almost two years in a nursing before before she passed away and that that was awful	does the medical care in nursing homes is typically less than	1
agent:moved through three different towns now|agent:yes oh no no no there's not there is not a whole lot of choice so they've they've|user:no so you probably don't have too much choice	uh-huh	1
agent:[vocalized-noise] me too that that is what scares me to death having to be in a [vocalized-noise] in the position like that but you think you think there could be something better than that|user:having to make the decision as to put them into a place like that or not|user:[vocalized-noise] think of	horrible	1
agent:oh how awful|agent:oh|user:cracked her skull open and that was sort of it but jus[t]- terrible	but um	1
agent:it's about two hours north of Pittsburgh|user:where's that|agent:[vocalized-noise]	oh okay	1

agent:and she keeps it year round|agent:because she you know they keep it warm with for all the older people|user:oh	i had never thought about that i could probably plant one and bring it in and just like i bring my plants in every year	1
agent:pardon me|user:and then i like um you know what daylilies are|user:it does	daylilies	1
agent:oh that'd be really pretty|agent:oh yeah|user:you know the real velvety looking stuff inside it it looks just like orchids in different colors that's what they look like	they are they're beautiful	0
agent:[laughter]|user:but the last day he said can't we leave the grass and i said yeah i think we will leave that [laughter]|agent:[laughter]	but um	0
agent:yeah|user:you know going off and leaving everything like that|user:i just couldn't see it	because this house i really liked it and everything but the yard was a lot to be desired oh	0
agent:uh-huh|user:really|agent:oh that'd be awful i love going out in the Summer in the grass	now i like to go to the beach where the sand is because_1 then it doesn't make me ill [laughter]	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh|user:um well the first thing we always plant is tomatoes i mean every year i don't care if we don't have anything else we're going to have tomatoes and then we plant cucumbers and	um [vocalized-noise]	1
agent:oh my gosh|agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:and um [laughter-yeah] we had some weird cucumbers because_1 they grew inside the fence i mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other	and it i mean it was but w[e]- they're so heavy you know they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down but	0
agent:uh-huh well sometimes too when we take out our garbage and we usually you know we just dump it in the middle of the garden you know after your garden's basically done|user:deposited them for us|user:and it was weird but the birds had you know evidently just	um-hum	1
user:whole areas of crime like drug usage and organized crime and|user:and uh then you get into|user:uh the whole defense industry's had some problems in that realm even the CEO's tend to steal a little of that here and there	as far as steps to reduce it uh	1

agent:hm|user:then uh they won't terminate you but any any time during that time if they do uh if you do test positive then uh it's automatic termination|user:i don't know cleaned your act up or whatever then	so uh	1
user:any more that uh drugs are so prevalent you know in our society that that uh|user:i think|user:i don't know i [vocalized-noise]	it may be up to the the work place to help try to control it because it doesn't seem like any where else uh you know	0

agent:oh really|user:and it's about Al Capone's brothers|agent:oh	primarily one of his brothers and i won't give the the whole plot away but it's it's really a good movie	0

agent:yeah well we have a lot of trees that that go across our front yards that are very old that must have been like where the line was in between the fields so we have couple of huge trees out front that's pretty nice no trees really in the back|user:you bet and i remember that [laughter]|agent:right along our street there used to be one of the um lines i guess there was fields here many many years ago cotton fields or something and	yeah	1
agent:oh|user:and uh Richland Park is just a super neat school|agent:oh	and they got a lot of neat programs	0
agent:that's a long time|user:oh we[ll]- you're you're almost a Texan i've been here thirty two years|agent:eight years	yeah [laughter] thirty two years and my wife's a Texan so of cou[rse]- naturally my children	0
user:uh i- yeah that's true that's true we did we did|user:yeah|user:huh [laughter]	and uh do you all do you all uh do you all have to water a lot over there	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:oh|user:well when we came back what used to be our flower [laughter-beds] [laughter-were] [laughter-solid] [laughter-Saint] [laughter-Augustine] [laughter-we] [laughter-had] [laughter-to] we had to dig it out [laughter] and the second tenant when we went to the Philippines the second tenant he had two little girls	and so they lived throughout the entire house he also had a dog in the house that i didn't know about	0
user:[laughter]|agent:right and i was i was going to school in his prime back when we had Archie Griffin and we were winning all the Heisman trophies and going to Rose Bowl that was when i was going to school there|user:oh you went to Ohio State oh you're uh up in the Woody Hays country huh	uh yeah	0
user:uh-huh|user:yeah|user:oh [laughter]	uh clothes are getting so expensive now in in the stores	0
user:uh right now i'm just sewing for myself i i do have two daughters that you know out they're they're grown now though|agent:well do you have kids and a husband are you sewing for a whole family or|agent:good night	i wish that i had started sewing you know when they were younger	0
agent:that's true|user:there's just so many people sewing now days|user:i know a lot of people where i work make their clothes it's just	uh-huh	1
agent:and when we broke things off actually we were supposed to get married when i got out of college so when we broke things off i quit crocheting it and i've never picked up a needle since then in fact i think it's still sitting in the top of the closet [laughter]|user:uh-huh|agent:and i started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that i was dating at the time	oh my goodness	1
agent:uh-huh|user:and we we would uh trim the seams and finish the edges|agent:sure	well this machine does it all in one step	0
agent:otherwise they hold it over your head forever right [laughter] now i bought you that machine [laughter] well that sounds really good|agent:you have to learn how to do it that's right [laughter]|user:so since i bought it and paid that much for it i guess i'd be[tter]- might as well get some use out of it [vocalized-noise] yes i'm going to have to do it	right	1
agent:yeah|user:uh-huh well i'm not that great either i used to be a lot better than i am now i i have played for uh the church choir and uh|agent:so i'm not great but i remember it [laughter]	i played for the choral club in high school and	1
user:uh-huh|agent:i try to save that for the weekend i need to get better at it though [laughter]|agent:so	well sewing does take up take an awful lot of time takes an awful lot of time	1
agent:well what are some of the other features on this machine it sounds wonderful|user:all the even the cutting i don't like|user:yeah i i like sewing sewing up the garment itself i really like to do that but the the cutting and the	well that's about it really it's it has four uh four threads instead of the the regular basic two threads	1
user:that's what really makes it look professional|user:and uh|agent:uh-huh	you can do a lot with the Serger though you can make uh piping and cording and	0
user:it's a machine it's not exactly a sewing machine but it doe[s]- it does sew the seam and trim the edges and all that stuff but there are oth[er]- are other things that|user:no it's it's a it's a|agent:like an attachment or	a regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do like you can't top stitch with it	0
agent:of the way forever|agent:there's not a way of getting him out|agent:so it really bothers me that	[noise] really i think that i don't know i don['t]- i don't think our prison system isn't set up	0
agent:uh-huh|user:yeah i have a degree in social work you see it you know the ones that have a genuine character change it is obvious and they know that they're they're not going to pardon someone from the governor you know what i'm saying they're not going to go without going through every channel of authority in the prison so i feel like you know that's is there is occasions where there are they do spare lives|agent:did you	and you know i leave that with the governor who of course is going to go through every	0
agent:and so forth|user:yeah|agent:we don't have a speedy trial we don't have speedy um punishment and so it kind of loses its meaning if you sit on death row for months and years	right	0
user:and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart what's the character|user:you know what i mean it's like looking beyond what they're doing|user:but you know it's like God changes your heart to not do that he changes your heart not to look upon a woman in lust because in the Old Testament they could look all they wanted just couldn't do it but in the new he's looking at your heart and so i guess that's what what i mean by their character changes and	showing me here and	0
user:that and if it was done quickly and done swiftly and|user:unless there's a true change of character and that's where we just have to to trust the authorities and they're not going to excuse people if it was was run like that i don't there would probably be very few exceptions to|user:sexual crimes	but it's not because the judicial system has rejected	1
agent:dealt with|user:uh-hum|agent:and sentenced to to death that that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly	yeah	1
user:wh[at]- when you have lawlessness|user:my husband's going Singapore and they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law and the law is enforced and that's what|user:Singapore is it like that	i mean the law's not being enforced	0
user:you can't force people but i think people are hurting and they're out doing crack sitting on the street they were the kind of people that|user:it was set up with God and it was really an integral part and no you can't|user:in the court system and i think initially when our country was set up	i think mostly we would want to receive it if it was presented to see i don't know i guess i'm kind of frustrated that	0
agent:because too too often they're can be extremism that that hurts from from any direction regardless of|user:yeah|agent:when people go so far out to the extreme on either side	right	1
user:[laughter-yeah]|agent:uh for world events i'll take CNN any day|user:do you enjoy mainly network news or like CNN	any day	0
user:be you know polarized more so on the top[ic]- on the|user:uh doesn't seem to be um granted i i i read primarily the more controversial topics so i'm sure that it's easier for them to uh|agent:and there's no mid ground anywhere in it	the news items that interest me most	1
user:um|user:in the forms that we have been attempting it is not realistic|user:well i think that it's been proven since somewhere in the early nineteen hundreds that rehabilitation	i can't remember the study but it was there was a quite a long-term study done in Europe	0
user:happens in a prison|user:what a lot of people tend to believe|user:uh which is	and	1
user:uh-huh|agent:concealed or unconcealed i'm all for that|agent:the average citizen to be able to pack his own weapon again	[laughter] why is that do you think the average citizen has the	0
user:i|user:i uh|user:yeah	i lived in a part of Houston that was uh	0
user:um|user:um my roommate was attacked and she got away unharmed but scared to pieces and had had all of her clothing ripped off of her|user:in my area	and then i had another friend that was also approached and got away	0
agent:firearms instruction N R say NRA certified firearms instruction|agent:that's where the only stipulation i'd like to see tacked on to the legislation saying that there had to be some form of formal|user:that their chances of getting it from me would be higher than my chances of using it effectively on them	uh-huh	1
user:very comfortable with the piece|user:oh i feel that is certainly if you're going to carry one you need to be uh|user:uh-huh	and have	0
user:if the if if you're talking about uh two people if you're talking about a criminal|user:but|user:you know the criminal ends up getting the gun and shooting the people to begin with you know the people that had it in the beginning	an assailant that is coming at you with a gun and you don't have a gun at all well the chances are a hundred percent they're going to get you	1
user:uh-huh|agent:hesitated|agent:they had the time to react but they	yeah	1
user:evaluated|user:uh|user:that would be something that would have to be	i feel prior to	0
agent:the lobbyists that are paying you know part of their way|agent:either best for the you know the the uh economy or whatever's best for the people that are|agent:uh they do what they think is	yeah	1
user:and i thought you know Kyle gets off usually about oh|user:my husband had worked late and i was going to go we wanted to go together to do it and take our son but it was like we ran in and whew we were the last people in there|user:and we ran in there it was like right at seven and	by five but we live in Tarrant County and he drives from	0
agent:uh-huh|user:you know legislation that encourages women to work outside the home because then you have two people you can tax and you you put both of those people in a higher bracket|user:it pays the Congress to make	and that it's probably not going to end anytime soon the pressure you know to work and just the pressure it puts on the American family	0
agent:and and see if there's a way to improve it not just say well that's the way it is or it's been that way for two hundred years|agent:and i think that's a you know we really ought to take a long hard look at at the system|user:uh-huh	[noise]	1
user:but because of the situation we just didn't think it was|user:even though um the mother really would given approval|user:but it you couldn't do that even through the state even the mo[ther]- it wasn't through the state but	wisdom you know you go in a restaurant and they start spitting their food out at the table now come on	0
agent:uh-huh|user:Meadow Road and seventy five at a restaurant there|agent:it's the rest of it huh you know the	and i couldn't believe it it was like this kid was like Saturday Night Live we were the	0
agent:yeah|user:because she was so skinny|agent:um	and then all these other people are coming up around us and	0
agent:[laughter-yeah]|user:you know that's what it i mean it was just absolutely maybe it was just that night right|user:we live in Euless now we don't see that in Euless too much but	but i don't think so i	1
agent:yeah|user:they're quite dependent on us right now|user:course we're in a good position they're	but that doesn't necessarily mean anything but	1
user:i think their reliance on us is is probably real|user:i i think their|user:i think i think they're in pretty bad shape right now	course that's not to say that once we get them on their feet again things won't go back the way they [laughter-were]	0
user:um|user:well it's going to be interesting in the next few years to see what happens because_1 there's quite a strong democratic|user:uh-huh	um	0
user:but you know i i i think that|user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter] that's true	i think or at least i hope tha[t]- they understood that's what was going to happen now you can't go from a a communist economy to a democratic one and expect things to be great overnight	0
agent:it's one of those things that all looks good on paper but putting it into reality is a a whole different ball game|user:oh well i don't know|user:[laughter-but]	yeah	1
user:we can only hope that that continues|user:um|agent:yeah	it's a precursor of things to come	1
agent:top secret aircraft that we have and|agent:and you know like giving them pla[ns]- plans for the some of the uh|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
user:[noise]	well what's your views on it	1
user:yeah we're not too far behind i graduated in seventy one so i'm i'm|user:uh-huh|agent:it's run down and beat up but it could be fixed up and used and it's just you know sitting there wasting away	same generation	0
user:like you say kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're going to do|user:it's just that|agent:uh-huh	and either the military or public service organization	0
user:yeah|agent:and uh you know it's there's there's a heck of a lot of difference between you know the intake that you get from TV and and movies and what you hear in school and then what reality is|user:oh yeah	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah|user:kids in high school are just too young to be married|user:you know why isn't somebody stepping in and and sto[p]- putting a stop to this	they ha[ve]- they have no idea what the world is like they don't how tough it is out there to make a living	0
user:yeah|user:uh-huh|agent:other people really live and know how bad off some people really are and how good they've got it	that's right	1
agent:um so many of the people that live around them are unable to do those things for themselves anymore|agent:you know i've i've s[o]- i my my parents are in their late sixties now and|user:and	yeah	1
agent:i think there'd there'd be a you know a uh economic benefit for you know everyone concerned those doing the work and those receiving the|agent:yeah|user:painting and stuff like that	oh yeah	0
user:well that's that's the that's the point we've gotten to you know every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government|agent:to do everything|user:yeah	and y[ou]- the government's going to be limited i where are they going to get the money they're going to get it from us	0
user:and and at least i had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing|agent:yeah|user:i uh in a way i think it's a little bit inefficient but but it's better than nothing	um	0
user:and what they would be making at minimum wage and they came out four thousand dollars better a year|user:under welfare|user:and we took all the benefits that a family that a a married couple with two kids would get	by taking welfare	0
agent:yeah they use both|user:yeah tha[t]- that's the way they did it in Alabama too|agent:both	u[sually]- usually you'd see these big chain gangs out [laughter-there]	0

agent:i don't really want to either [laughter] because i have no problems about it either way|agent:i don't i don't know if uh can't make any judgments of that nature but uh|user:uh-huh	[laughter]	1

user:but uh|agent:right|user:could either go before or after work	uh that pushes some people	1

user:yeah plus i think|user:plus|agent:i don't i don't have an answer for the local elections and why you have ten percent of the people voting that's really so low i'm amazed	a lot of people are just [laughter-flat] disgusted	0
user:i'm sure that there's a legitimate reason for it but i don't understand|user:plus also i|agent:sacred and and until it's all over	uh personally why you have to register	0
agent:what that holds back or anything|agent:uh|user:yeah	yeah	1
agent:um-hum|user:either your driver's license or your social security number or something like that because|user:it seems like to me they could use uh	a lot of people don't vote because they didn't register	1

agent:yeah|user:well it works that way with uh with anybody who buys it's very difficult when you first buy your house uh but [vocalized-noise] once but once you do that and hang on to it|agent:they've had their house that long	you'd be surprised what inflation does to uh	0

user:huh|agent:big garage a big basement uh just like my parents house except for on the water [laughter]|user:yeah right	well maybe some day you'll own your parents' homes	1
user:getting a lot of uh criticism lately i guess over the years it's always|user:the uh public school sys[tem]- system seems to be	seemed worse uh to the parents that have kids in there than it was when they were there so	0
agent:great|user:wealthy district as as all that fighting's going on over who gets the money and the like but|user:they have uh really a lot of computers uh it's a very	they have	1
agent:oh|user:they decided to build one big rectangular building and then not have any walls for the classroom|user:we also managed to land in a school that uh	and so it gets a little noisy it's a little hard to keep the kids that quiet from one class to the next and they can't really	1
user:so they they put a few more warm bodies in there than the teachers really needed to have they still have a twenty three to twenty five or so to one|agent:oh goodness|user:thousand fifty right now	teacher ratio but it's still	1
agent:well great|user:and there's it's real nice park lands on both sides of the school they have you know climbers and stuff like that but|user:to pick up the kids that's how much of a chunk it takes out of the old day but uh it is better just to let them you know play outside than it is to fight the traffic so	the the school system in and of itself as far as what they're teaching	0
user:well another thing that we've noticed that's uh changed over the years and|agent:so um|user:uh-huh	uh we're not really sure exactly what we're going what we want to do with it publicly but uh	1
user:uh you know when they get into a fight they|user:uh third and fourth graders that are|agent:um-hum	they tend to use some of the the	1
EMPTY	[noise]	0

agent:no i haven't|user:there's um a thing called Pfeiffer Rim i don't know if you've ever heard of it|user:so we're hoping to do like a three day weekend	it's uh there's a town called Glenrose i think it's around two hours from here	0
agent:it is it's you know it's it's high canyon and uh and there's this little mountain lakes and it's very peaceful and um in in the early fall time um|user:she loves that she says that's where we need to go sometime|agent:well see you need to go there	oh	1
agent:i'd like to do with my children you know again|agent:you know what that was one of the things i really thought|agent:i[t]- i[t]- it it i just ha[ven't]- haven't been able to do it and	uh-huh uh-huh	1

user:and they're being plunked down in plunked down into America|user:feel really quite hurt and and unsure of themselves when here because they're coming from you know from the slash and burn intercultural society you know they're coming from the middle ages basically|user:Southeast Asians the Hmong people that i've done some work with uh	many of them had been promised by the CIA during the war over there that because they cooperated with the CIA and they helped the CIA out that when they came here the CIA would help establish them in America and the CIA of course isn't doing that	0
user:they have you know|user:and uh|user:you know these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war	so i- i- i do have a lot of sympathy for them and i feel that America could try a little bit harder to to help people adjusting to the American way because_1 if they don't you're just going to produce	1
user:they they haven't the foggiest idea|agent:yeah [laughter] but anyway i enjoy it they the kids i've worked with so far have been Spanish speaking|agent:what to say it's not step to step	yes	0
user:very much and and i- i mean|user:yeah it would be a good experience and you'd be helping people i'm sure|agent:and i think that would be wonderful too	not to put not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the Asian groups are having a lot of trouble i mean and part of the problem is that a lot of Chinese and Japanese immigration from you know	0
agent:um-hum|user:uh more of the volunteer network service because_1 everyone gains from it|agent:no	would be would might be really useful	1

user:and it's a fly|agent:uh-huh|user:something that looks like something else	you call it a pattern	1
agent:um|user:yeah yeah you know how that changes|agent:oh it's just that that just happens to be what the fish like this year huh	the phase of the moon and	1
user:well|user:yeah it's|agent:i used to do that with my dad every once in a while we'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day before it got too hot	there you fish mornings and evenings	0
user:fishing is not just just dragging fish out of the water it's it's a|agent:we did not know what to do about it|user:yeah	total experience you know getting out in nature and	1
agent:could care less the uh three and a half year old|agent:and the little one of course is|user:ah	yeah yeah	1
agent:well yeah but TI is up there so [laughter] that part of it would probably work out|user:well and you've got to have you've got to work for a living to|agent:i don't know all of our family is here so	what division y'all in	1
agent:long as you have a good time that's the main point so|agent:yeah|user:it is fun you know it	the the experience is	1
agent:so that was kind of funny|user:[laughter]|agent:three feet [laughter-away] [laughter] and it's like oh well [laughter] maybe we ought to move just a touch	yeah it it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden	1
user:i guess occasionally i'll hear|agent:but uh|user:i	someone at work say something though	1
agent:because it usually works|agent:which i think is awful|agent:you know they try to play public's opinion	uh-huh true	0
user:uh-huh|agent:as what we would've paid in state income tax i mean [laughter] probably would have paid the same amount but you know it's not the idea of your paying uh income tax|agent:so i mean it wouldn't have been as painful	true	1
agent:yeah it it|user:seems to have helped him though|agent:i think he ought to should've gone in there and blew them away	popularity wise	1
agent:yeah|user:we did last night uh some real massive thunderstorms|user:we did	apparently i i don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too	0
agent:yeah [laughter]|user:yeah it's a lot more humid down that way|agent:it you walk out on the ground i mean you i mean it's awful it's just so soggy	in fact miserable	1
agent:right|user:go out to places i mean we don't go to places where we all dress up and all that you know and|user:we	all that we try to get uh	0
agent:but uh i was i was just amazed there's this one place called CC's pizza|user:no more eating out for a while [laughter]|agent:[laughter] right	uh-huh	1
user:and uh you know we've eaten there sometimes and it's pretty good it's you know it's|agent:yeah|agent:wow	a little more expensive than	0
agent:greatest banana cream pie and it wa[s]- was uh you could take it home it was it was just it was so popular it was great stuff and now now my mou[th]- mouth's watering i'm beginning to think about that [laughter] yeah the uh yeah twenty dollars that's we can do pretty that's that's what we try to aim for just the two of us or naw you know if we want to have some wine or something we start get into the forty dollar range i guess and|agent:and they had the [grest/greatest]|user:uh-huh	oh sorry [laughter]	1
user:yeah i've got to try i um|user:huh|agent:it's like uh it's all right with me [laughter] well we've been to some wha[t]- what have been rated fancy Mexican restaurants and uh they were good i have to say they were good	years ago um we we're uh my folks were um	0
agent:ooh what a deal|user:of a wanton soup and it's like twelve fifty|agent:yeah	yeah it's great	1
agent:kids learn at different rates and for too long they've kind of lumped everybody together you'd learn at this rate and that's the only way it's going to happen|agent:or i wish i would love to see them go with|agent:the first direction that i can see	yeah that's true [laughter]	1
agent:but why not hit the points the kid's really interested in because if he's interested he's going to study it and he's going to learn it and he's going to remember it|user:yeah that's|agent:i mean it's great to be well rounded and have be exposed to all this stuff	that's true	0
user:uh American History|agent:what what type of history class is it that you're having to take|user:and i mean it's so boring and i just hate it [laughter] and i think why do they make us take this stuff i mean what does this have to do with getting you know a computer science degree or whatever you know [laughter]	we have to take um	0
user:i don't know maybe [noise] two weeks ago and they were talking about i don't know where you're from but i'm from the Dallas area|user:any way this this um school system thing i i tell you i saw something on the news oh|user:yeah that's true yeah	and they were talking about the Plano school system	0
user:uh the the thing you know they said well we're giving them isolation time and this helps them to think [laughter]|user:you know and|user:being put in this closet well how is that helping my child	but a lot of kids i mean if a child has	1
user:you know i i definitely had to disagree with that i think that is|user:i mean either way [laughter]|user:i said now what good does thi[s]- i mean how is this helping	that's not the way to handle	0
user:[noise]|user:uh-huh|agent:it's going to tax you physically	i i don't	1
user:di[scipline]- discipline okay but okay for instance one of the things they do at uh my kids school|user:is not just|user:i mean one of the things that can come out of uh	uh	0
user:is much better|user:positive reinforcement|user:that's	much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids because they're going to be good	0
user:i don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked [laughter]|user:they they do when they deserve it you know but uh|user:and it really helps and i mean they they don't get spanked very often but	i mean i i think i wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child but you know that's just my	0
user:that uh they they felt that that since the government was backing them_1 they could just uh go ahead and make these transactions and make these loans and get all this money as it were|user:a bit of a system whereby the the natural human greed was able to flourish and some people were able to do some things that|user:the uh whole savings and loan thing seems to be uh	and it was rather difficult to catch all if if any of the people that were really responsible for it and even those who were caught didn't seem to get	0
agent:uh and uh it it's as if uh they they went crazy just just like in gambling almost|user:right|agent:you've overbuilt if you're not careful	um-hum	1
user:uh|user:the news media as it were and|agent:yeah	there were a number of banks that made the bad loans and basically it's been a good weeding out process there's just been a lot of people a lot of banks a lot of whole organizations that were going to make these kinds of loans	0
agent:uh you you can't just write that off completely you can write off a certain part of it i guess|agent:of which is bad loans and the like just not going to get paid back at least by the people who caused the debt|agent:uh what what what how do see that this this indebtedness	right	1
agent:a uh oh we've got we've got three but they're they're kind of older children now uh we've got a daughter twenty three that's a senior in college|user:well i have two boys actually they're nine years old and uh five and a half actually almost six now and they're in kindergarten and uh fourth grade how about yourself|user:okay	okay	1
agent:oh yeah|user:that they're demanding of it you [laughter-know] they they want our time|user:and um you know we enjoy um we enjoy doing more things outdoor playing ball with them my husband likes to play freeze tag with them and and i think as American parents we probably we spend more time than is typical i think uh with the kids and part of that is	uh and uh my husband enjoys you know doing those things with them he spends a lot of time with them and it seems to me anyway from observing other families in the neighborhood that he spends a lot more time	0
agent:i'll say|agent:oh yeah|agent:yeah	well we've had last weekend we had eighty seven which was	0
agent:okay well what this is is it's it's really sponsored by the Y but it's nonsectarian uh is that it's the concept was|user:no no i haven't heard of that|user:um	um-hum	1

agent:um-hum|user:uh the the New England area and also in in Pennsylvania Ohio and New York the just run all of a sudden we're out of landfill|user:yeah i i think really probably what hit people's you know i know that here in the up in the uh	and then they're saying w[e]- we estimate this landfill will be ov[er]- will be full in two years	0
agent:yeah|user:because i know that like in Pennsylvania|agent:well	they require them to um put their newspaper for recycling but	0

agent:is that the one set in the fifties or sixties|user:ye[ah]- of the three of those Diner's probably the best i mean they're they're all pretty good but Diner is really worth seeing|user:yeah well	uh late fifties yeah	0

agent:and i'm still pretty much a Eagle fan i guess|user:yeah|agent:well it's kind of same for me i i grew up in uh southern New Jersey and the local team was Philadelphia and they were like you know thirty miles right up the river	i guess you keep those things you grew up with i worked in uh Missouri for a while and	0
agent:boy they uh they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago|user:uh these guys are right maybe they will come through and and do something this year i look for it to be a pretty good year|user:there's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there's there's a chance that maybe uh	they did uh they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we weren't uh weren't familiar with some of them turned out to be pretty good players	0
agent:yeah|user:every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through|user:we hope	in a way Aikman has done some of that	0
user:so|agent:yeah|user:and and start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few [vocalized-noise] few minutes	i don't know i'm looking for for a good year i guess we're always looking for a good year	1
agent:i'm sure you know i mean my sentimental favorite would have to be Philadelphia but i i sure am scared of them Giants [laughter]|agent:yeah|user:i don't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the the team sometimes it brings in new motivation and and y[ou]- all you can do is get out of the way because here they come	well that's true	0
agent:[laughter-boy] speaking of Denver i've [laughter] on another subject i've been up there like five times in the last three four weeks [laughter]|user:and|agent:yeah	[noise]	1

agent:the benefits are funny|user:oh some of the benefits i- s[ee]- i- i never really counted that as an organization because it's uh|user:okay	yeah the benefits are strange they change every day	0
agent:here in the Springs we have a choice of two either an HMO or a company health insurance|agent:yeah|agent:uh	yeah	0
agent:well there are other benefits with the military|user:they're not doing anything to me other than testing me so i let them do that|user:uh which has to be their doctor but	[noise]	1
user:and when you start|agent:and then you can't draw it|user:except for the except for the little thing that you're paying into social security for twenty years	that's right and then and then you start drawing your retirement pay and if you start drawing the social security they offset your retirement dollar for dollar	0
agent:uh|user:um|user:that's right draw your own inference	but but	0
user:i i wouldn't have any problems with them it's the daily uh go in with the with the flu or something like that|user:yeah i mean don't get me wrong uh it's [vocalized-noise] for something something that was major|agent:somewhat adequate	and and the the treatment is terrible	0
user:and uh|user:they're gonna they're gonna get the most bang for their buck|agent:yeah exactly and	you know they're they're in the big profit making business	1
agent:uh-huh|user:i know my roomie's got um the insurance through the school|user:i know	and it it runs fifty eight i think fifty eight bucks a month something like that	1
user:[noise]|user:but forget about things like uh eyes or your teeth or anything else|user:no i mean you can go [vocalized-noise] it will cover something major	it i[t]- what it is it's medical insurance on paper	1
user:uh they create|user:well it's sort of like North Carolina North Carolina has an interesting thing on their income tax|user:yeah	money	0
user:i wr[ote]- i- i attached a little note to my my return when i sent it in saying|agent:huh|user:and they create money out of thin air	gee i didn't know i had this extra three hundred dollars i wonder where it went	1
agent:it's not a violent overthrow of the people in Washington|user:eleven|user:no	no because because	0
user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	go ahead	1
agent:i still consider them a threat|agent:completely roll over and disappear preferably buried|agent:government	uh-huh	1
agent:they drink that much fuel|agent:the only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time|agent:if the bombs don't get you if the bullets don't get you then the then the nerve gas definitely will get you	uh-huh	1
agent:to whether it's our side their side it's a matter of money to a certain extent|agent:it all boils down|user:we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too it's bad enough that the Soviets do it	um	0
user:to do something to get out of communism i guess i'd would like to see somebody like Yeltsin|user:they're about|user:well i think Russia is getting to the point where they're	to get more power i think Gorbachev has about had his day	1
user:okay um|agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	i guess what i guess my [laughter] my task [laughter] i usually ride my bike i have uh a stationary bike and uh a regular bike and when i can i like to ride my regular bike outside because it's just so much nicer [laughter] the stationary bike is is so um	0
agent:yeah it's totally women|user:so is it just women that go there|agent:i just love it	see i think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a place uh a a health club because	0
agent:oh yeah|user:really that's|agent:and they've got such fantastic equipment in there	that's great how	1
agent:i never think about it until after you go there for about a week [noise] your toes you start getting blisters anyway so no big deal|agent:but|user:huh that's really [laughter-funny]	huh [laughter]	0
user:i mean it's just|user:but i know that i have to do it|user:it's at least something [laughter] you know it it i just force i have to force myself to do it like i said because to me i really don't enjoy it	it's it's not a question of whether i want [laughter-to] you know	1
agent:especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard it will bother me it will bother me|user:um|agent:but if i walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother me	then that would yeah i guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you wouldn't it	1
agent:oh yeah you can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too|agent:it worked out well|user:but they have packages where they just offer the exercise program is that what you're saying	i see okay	1
agent:but most of the others to me are very dull|user:that's you know i wanted|agent:walk up and down stairs	i wanted to get one of those steppers when i bought the bike but i got talked into the bike instead and	0
EMPTY	[noise]	1
agent:right right|user:uh i mean the first thing is the oh if it's going to be mandatory it's got to be mandatory i mean everybody not just like you know poor people and all that you know but|user:tries before i found somebody well you know i'm like i'm not really sure what i think about this um	you know senators' sons and all that stuff too i mean everybody's got to do it	0
user:well i guess it's going to depend on how i mean if if you're talking about any [vocalized-noise] if you're talking about something that's like a full time|agent:uh and i i guess i i can't see that as being something to really object to|agent:and i find ways to to turn some of that back to to others	you know one year full time you know this is what you do you know you're going to go and and fill pot holes and you know and you know all that stuff i mean	1
user:well|user:uh-huh|agent:that's bad and this would give them a chance to have some positive self esteem something that they turn back	an[d]- and also you know you you you feel more like you know you're actually part of the community if you've done something	0
user:and just|user:oh uh that would be a nightmare|agent:with the heartache of first of all getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics	i mean just getting getting it going	1
agent:PR campaign in each community each county|user:uh-huh|agent:tha[t]- that would be a part of selling it to the community to the adults ahead of them that probably would never serve and and to each succeeding generation there'd definitely have to be a major	uh-huh	1
agent:a year before that had been turned down because_1 they said well it's not feasible it's not a good idea|agent:recycling campaigns that|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:right|agent:and as soon as the oil prices came back down we the pendulum swung the other way and we need those reminders|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:you had uh you know there was one part like we were waiting to get some water right and we were looking at where we could get some water and it said you know it was like|user:no no not at all but uh	we can either try to get here tonight or just sleep it	0
agent:uh-huh|user:that had you know that sold stuff|user:and then we found this little hut a couple of miles down	so we just stopped there uh you know had some breakfast got some water and kept on walking	0
agent:you know fourteen thousand feet or whatever and we said we[ll]- well how dirty could the water be right you nev[er]- never think about bacteria or amoeba or anything like that you think well nobody's using the bathroom farther up stream so it's got to be all right so we were doing things like uh|user:yeah|user:yeah	right	1
agent:and the two guys i was with they were like well this you're a wimp you know because we've been drinking out of the water and we're okay so they went out fly fishing and they're having a great time|user:yeah|user:[laughter]	uh-huh	1
user:yeah|agent:you can throw big tents and food and and stoves and everything in and all you have to do is just you don't even have to if you go downstream you hardly even have to paddle and it's uh|user:yeah	well it all depends on what the rapids are like	1
agent:and uh you've really got to be careful who you go out there with and that they're out|agent:that's true you can't even uh because i know uh even i and my wife would probably uh have a hard time sitting in sitting out in the woods for a couple of days|user:and so because you have to know who you're going with to get along	yeah	1
agent:yeah they're i think a farm league of the Braves|user:oh okay and uh uh [laughter] we're not to have much mutual interest there but i'm curious uh uh what class are they class A|agent:uh i guess the Durham Bulls [laughter]	oh okay	1
agent:okay|user:uh hang on a second Rick i got to see who that is|agent:yeah [noise]	you still there Rick [noise]	0
agent:yeah well have you heard anything about Jim Palmer|user:uh he he has to be an outstanding physical specimen to to do what he's done|agent:um	uh well Palmer tried a comeback	0
agent:i don't even know anymore i i- i follow the Dodgers more than the Phillies but uh i- i grew up in Philadelphia i guess that's why|agent:yeah|agent:yeah	well who do they	0
agent:um|user:and i'm not sure they put the prices up a dollar a ticket this year we may have to go less|agent:um	but	0
agent:well a little more modern day but not much|user:yes|agent:or is it it's just like that exactly	yeah	1
user:yeah but|agent:and you'll get a seat|agent:i mean you could you the game could be at seven thirty at seven fifteen and you could say hey let's go to the [laughter-game]	yeah yeah uh uh there's probably that's pretty neat because i don't imagine Raleigh's so big that you have big traffic jams going one way or the other	1
user:yes and what's really neat about it is the shrimp|agent:oh it sounds fantastic|user:and then i have a cauliflower that i would cook garlic bread green salad tea and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert	is cooked in your uh	0
agent:yes|user:and you put a little bit of that over it now if you use the dried kind|agent:uh-huh	then you would only use two of them	0
agent:oh yeah|user:i usually put garlic powder in mine|user:and then you serve it with melted butter and uh	and they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it	1
user:and you uh put about two tablespoons of uh|agent:okay uh-huh|user:but it's got to have one that has a cover on it	water into this bowl	0
agent:you know|agent:it depends out here like the type of people you're going to entertain|agent:we have Italians and we have Portuguese and we have Russians and Polish and	uh-huh	1
agent:does it look like a lobster|agent:oh it does|agent:[vocalized-noise]	um it looks more like a crab	1
agent:Louisiana oh well do you do cajun cooking|user:Louisiana|agent:and and where did you say you were from	uh-huh	1
agent:you now but uh|user:oh okay well i guess you could cook it in in that too but|agent:i did have i don't have it now but i have mostly Teflon	i don't know you know i never have i use uh uh the black iron skillet to cook mine	1
agent:is that what you're saying|user:right|agent:now would you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time	uh-huh	0
agent:you know roasts and that kind of thing|agent:uh gravies and pizzas and|agent:so we cook a lot of pasta and	uh-huh	1
agent:now where where do you go when you go there uh right on Basin Street and those places|user:we're only going down there for the food though [laughter]|user:and uh	uh yeah	0
agent:is is is that with seafood|user:uh-huh right|agent:gumbo right	uh-huh you can even make it with chicken or you can make it with seafood	1
user:don't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions but if those who don't vote if you made them vote and it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way|user:um it's a problem if those voting|agent:uh bu[t]-	you know in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other just like everyone who did vote	0
user:but it's funny because here in California things are getting uh increasingly democratically oriented in in the sense of people being able to vote for things i mean we have these initiatives state initiatives now|agent:that's right um|user:and uh [noise] wish i could vote on more things frankly	the first really popular you know wide spread one was uh Proposition Thirteen which was a uh tax revolt	0
agent:[laughter]|agent:that's true [laughter]|user:yeah i wouldn't mind having oh more votes than i get to have frankly [laughter] anyone who doesn't vote it's fine with me as long as i can have their [laughter-vote] [laughter] that would make me happy though maybe not in a in a deep philosophical sense but in a selfish sense it probably would	i don't know it's interesting uh some countries voting is obligatory	0
user:and it's not clear to me that that's so much less democratic|user:and in that country it's a duty to pay taxes and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent|agent:it's a duty right	um	0
agent:that's right i feel it|user:part of me and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like well if you didn't vote you get what's coming to you you know|user:well i that's how i feel i mean if you if you vote and your guy looses well you leas[t]- you least tried and you can say something but if you don't vote i sort of feel like	and certainly that's true in the overall i mean no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole i sort of feel that way	1
user:no i'm not|user:i|agent:i'm inte[rested]- are you a TI employee i'm interested not okay i just wondered	and uh so i'm i'm really quite quite curious how that would work to have both i mean you know and i believe in the	0
agent:they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty|user:um-hum|user:um-hum um-hum [noise]	uh-huh uh-huh well that's a thought	0
agent:don't have a great i [laughter] i think i checked that as a question i'd be willing to discuss [laughter-too] [laughter]|user:gosh so we don't have a great solution yet do we [laughter]|agent:that's	[laughter]	1
user:and can protect against the tyranny of democracy|user:and and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions|user:presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person	because just as you can have a tyranny of a single	0
user:[noise]|agent:sometimes i think we have that right now with [laughter-Congress]|agent:[laughter]	yeah well i i mean i feel that	0
agent:they in essence have gotten around it by by listing uh decimal inches|agent:uh which is somewhat awkward but had it been millimeters you could have done i think what's interesting the way engineering people do is they|agent:well no what we did was wind up using and you just go you just go down and and you get out the the so many inches and and we just marked a little bit less than that	uh yeah yeah	1
user:and i've had motorcycles Japanese motorcycles for years and years and the metric system comes easy to me|user:and|user:yes i am i i have a Suzuki motorcycle	but my	1
agent:um it was [laughter] simply a ploy to to get people you know|agent:yeah but the idea was is that by with five fifths um they could uh they could uh they could sell five and and|user:and and they had quarts at the same time though	yeah	1
user:but what really annoys me is the way we in the United States have been converting to metric|user:yeah yeah|agent:and well what's a mill and [laughter]	we have a	0
agent:oh okay|user:because it came from Canada|user:the engine itself was mostly metric	and the starter was	1
user:radiator and on the|user:you go from the uh water pump up to the|user:and uh	water pump	1
user:my other con[cern]- concern is|user:it it can be annoying and|user:[laughter] right right	is the American government going to force us to go	1
agent:uh three pounds um and you|agent:i don't know and and but you know when you go to the store and and you're trying to figure you know well this box is is uh is is twelve ounces and and this one's uh|user:and what will a shot be will a shot be an ounce	and the other one's	1
user:tenth indicator it's a hundred dollars|user:a one|user:uh you got to have	uh	0
agent:yes|user:real fast|agent:so you've got thousands of dollars or so i mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools	real real fast	0
agent:uh-huh|user:i was just trying to think about how i how i dress for work you know TI is a very casual atmosphere|user:um	and uh what i usually do on the weekend is is lay out five outfits	0
user:uh|user:uh pullover sweaters or|user:mostly what i wear are skirts and blouses or you know skirts and	you know little	0
agent:[laughter]|user:and they dress up like when customers are coming in|user:and um a lot of people just just wear jeans and and uh sweats all the time	or uh when we have	0
agent:uh he goes to work in his blue jeans T-shirt and tennis shoes and he just loves it|agent:you know whenever he was going to school he was expecting to having to wear uh a tie or a dress shirt everyday but|agent:and um	uh-huh	1
agent:blue jeans and a T-shirt|agent:you know if he had the preference i mean his his preference is um|agent:he didn't you know he's not really into all that he would wear it if he had to for his job and all but	uh-huh	1
agent:that's how i am but my mama was not raised like that and so [laughter]|agent:see that's how|user:yeah she always had to have a lot of clothes	uh-huh	1
agent:very interested in learning|agent:that's something that i'd be very interested in|agent:um	right because clothes are s[ome]- are really expensive	0
user:she dressed him|agent:oh no|user:and uh sh[e]- she used to dress him out of Neiman Marcus i mean	oh fabulously	0
user:and yeah and you just have to keep buying them|agent:always [laughter]|user:right	you know if you if you if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the the quality is really not that great you know for the price that you pay	1
user:uh like it was embellished around the the top you know it had uh leather leather designs and|user:and it had|agent:uh-huh	um	0
agent:the defect|user:and then i was told by somebody that works for JC Penney's that um Ross Ross is just one of those places that sell[s]- sells seconds|agent:[laughter]	yeah yeah	0
user:yeah there's been uh same thing locally here a couple of uh we got a Senator who uh|agent:[laughter]|agent:[laughter-yeah] [laughter]	went on national TV and said that you know if Bush tried to	0
agent:um-hum|user:it's already the nineties i forgot i forget that too|user:right around the turn of uh oh gosh [laughter] i should say the eighties [laughter-now]	they they just haven't seemed to been able to hit anything	0
agent:try to get the conservative candidate for once|user:i i|agent:um-hum	yeah i mean if ou[t]- out of all the Democrats that i could think to run i w[ould]- he is one that i would i would definitely like to see	1
user:yeah|user:um-hum|user:yeah	i mean i mean they were really stuck because_1 here they were everybody was expecting Je[sse]- Jesse to get at least the VP nomination	0
user:uh|agent:sort of set the agenda and and let let people do the work it's it's unfortunate how how little domestic agenda he|agent:true	and set the agenda and	1
user:well you know the interesting thing about i don't know if you've been watching Massachusetts lately|user:yeah|agent:and i ju[st]- here's my chance to giggle boy it's a good thing we didn't elect that Dukakis [laughter-guy] because i mea[n]-	um	1
user:and uh you know it was ju[st]- it was a pure disaster because_1 the way it was set up|agent:um-hum|user:yeah and then on the other hand too while he was out busy running for the presidential thing the legislature was having their own way	he's the one that that put it together and he's the only one who knew how it worked or supposedly worked	0
user:[laughter]|user:[laughter] it it wa[s]-|agent:[laughter] that's incredible oh oh there['s]- there's one thing i've got to ask you about the the dump Quayle movement i find that interesting	i wish they would	1
agent:um-hum|user:i i m[y]- my degree was in political science because i enjoyed it|user:i know i and i i'll tell you you know it	and i had a good time during that during that election but it floored me when he came up with Quayle	0
user:i mean [laughter]|agent:[laughter]|user:but the guy is so uncharismatic	[laughter] i mean Bush talks about he doesn't like broccoli well that's h[ow]- how i think of Dan Quayle as broccoli	0
agent:file instrument flight plan just to get into the Washington area|agent:lot of times when i was coming back home i would uh|user:[laughter]	um	1
user:flat and stagnant and|user:over here in Raleigh it's kind of|user:yeah if you if you're over by Asheville you're you're pretty good because you're up there in the mountains and you've got some nice ozone and all that	just yucky	1
user:and you could see the smog|user:and it was unseasonably warm|user:couple of weeks ago	just sitting on top of the city	1
agent:ignored the trucks entirely|agent:uh as being a major source of pollution and they've uh|user:yeah	yeah right	1
user:yeah|agent:the houses get coated with oil|user:yeah	[noise]	0
agent:uh-huh|user:it it seems funny that it's coming around at the time when we're losing the most most of the forests|user:i wonder too you know they keep talking about ozone depletion and all this	because i i i think that a lot of the pollutants and stuff are being taken out of the air	1
agent:fourteen inch uh snows|user:uh-huh|agent:on the tractor and i had to use it we had three uh	uh-huh	1
user:on that one day i mean you know of course you always have severe weather somewhere|agent:oh i didn't know that|user:for severe weather in the country	but there was more of it on that one day than ever recorded before	0
agent:i didn't notice that uh know that they'd discovered any thinness or over me[tro]- metro areas|agent:yes|user:because that's certainly not going to improve things around there	yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:a permanent high pressure area|agent:of uh meteorology i can understand the Poles because they're uh	yeah	1
agent:[laughter]|user:and it's the days that i keep looking for [laughter-that] aren't going to happen in my lifetime|agent:uh-huh	but [laughter]	1

user:in Latin America i think the one in Mexico is closed and i think the one in in Brazil is closed but i|user:locations not quite a few several|user:i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever and they had quite a few	i don't know why that is a problem down there and i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too and uh	1
user:right|agent:in his wildest dreams from his neighbors|agent:far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking in	yeah i know that i saw in a book i was reading a Spanish book uh not that i read Spanish you know i just you know reading some Spanish words and there was a comment in there about	1
agent:yeah well it's it's so interesting i ju[st]- i just don't think Mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics|user:whatever i i don't want to make i read it somewhere though it's not my point i guess [laughter]|agent:i don't know	no no they they were lucky enough to have some oil	0
user:there are problems with|user:when you certainly can speak their language uh and|user:we should teach Spanish at least in uh grammar school you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish i think that helps	you know the wet back problem you know for everyone knows what we're talking about when say wet back problem and then we should somehow	1
user:uh poverty|user:i think a a common factor to a lot of problems both whether it be crime if if you want to jump on that is mostly|agent:it was pretty wild	uh and i think a lot of their problems is poverty if we could	0
user:and they're they haven't had|user:uh they're in Taiwan and Japan|user:building a plant in Singapore	what	0
agent:of what speech is like|agent:some kind of a model|agent:of uh of casual speech uh in an attempt to get	right	1
agent:yeah|user:found your your voice echoes in your own head which is makes it different than what it really sounds to other people|user:has changed uh although you you never	uh	0
user:i haven't gotten really involved in anything|user:far as car repairs go is is change oil and filter an and that kind of stuff|user:i don't know what the the last thing i've done	uh extensive in car repairs in oh oh probably a year or so i think the last thing i did of any significance was change the	0
user:you know|agent:oh yeah yeah basically that's it|user:and a woman asked me what that meant and i said that means that i can't work on it	they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that uh	0
user:and basically it it was a motor|agent:uh-hum|user:that had the the three fifty in it	and you didn't have all the other junk around it	0
user:i think the onl[y]- closest thing i've come to to a diesel is i've worked for a tractor repair shop|agent:and uh [laughter]|user:well that's true	uh when i was in high school	1
user:i su[re]- i don't know if it's still|user:One of the reasons is i i'm beginning to wonder is where do you get gas at|user:i guess you're right the the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status i don't know exactly why	uh limited	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:yeah well [vocalized-noise]|user:made a major mistake years ago when they stopped putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes	i'm convinced that the small	0
user:and uh|user:the the first well my first car was a fifty six Mustang|user:yeah that's kind of like	over the years uh all i had a	0
user:yeah|agent:i was look under the hood of that the other day and like you say you can see the road it's amazing|agent:and uh	well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to	1
agent:really a mess back under there under the in that van|agent:and all the {antismog} stuff and uh boy that was uh|user:yeah the {antismog} pumps	[noise] and all that stuff loads the	0
user:yeah|agent:what an inch and a half wide got a bunch of groves in it|agent:oh it's that one that's about uh	i haven't had to replace the thing yet it looks like it would be uh	0
agent:this is the first one in a week or so and|agent:yeah i hadn't uh hadn't not gotten any calls here in the last uh|user:i'd say seven or eight of them	yeah i haven't gotten any calls in two weeks so i don't know if	0
agent:okay|user:okay so i think i think what we should talk about is the the war|user:[noise]	um	0
agent:um-hum|user:and so when Iraq you know saw this they said let's take over the country which is a good idea|agent:um-hum	right then the United States says okay our our oil prices are going to go up and	0
user:but these countries here which you know|agent:um-hum|user:you know state with a president and everything but we're not going to go into your country	are you know like in nineteen eighty four have you ever read that book	1
user:you're wasting so much money to send you know it's like how much money did the US spend|user:and so the thing is is that|agent:um-hum	when they could have paid so much money for each barrel of oil that was being	1
agent:stopped too soon i don't i don't i really don't know what we need to do about that|agent:i don't know if we|user:and uh	well	0
agent:which is very difficult to do|agent:uh-huh|user:well the thing is is that first of all they got to they go[t]- they have to get him	and and there's no way that you can get him unless it's by force	0
agent:um-hum|user:and you know like he sent planes over to to shoot the people down that were on the border with uh tha[t]- [vocalized-noise] that were on their way to Turkey|agent:um-hum	he had a couple of them bombarded	1
user:but the other countries that you know that have oil but not as big you know like they say|agent:yep|user:and we need it desperately	you know like when the prices went up and then they went down	0
agent:oh really well there's still a lot of dollar five places around here but you can find some that's under a dollar but not not a whole lot that's the lowest i've seen|user:here it's like it's like a dollar five|user:oh God	yeah	1
agent:um-hum|user:people take a[dvantage]- take advantage of that you know like the the companies were saying we're trying not to raise our prices but when you know when we get a barrel coming in at more than what we're selling it for we've got to raise our prices|user:it's just that you know people	you know but still if you realize that uh one barrel has like how much was it like uh	1
user:because uh i uh does does the US government own any gas companies|agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum	like like you know like gas stations and stuff	0
user:they're just some things that|user:you know they're just|user:but um	might not be worth it	1
agent:worldwide support for for what was happening|agent:and i i guess i see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War we just had where President Bush went out and got|user:right	right	1
user:right|agent:that was done emotionally on so many of the people|agent:and i'm not sure you can undo the damage	no i don't think you can and i i agree with you that i i think that	0
agent:that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause i i feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and|agent:uh you know whether it was justified or not i know|agent:of the effects	uh-huh	1
agent:uh i think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more|user:uh-huh|agent:i think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that were so hateful towards the United States have come away with uh kind of a different attitude	right	1
agent:we've learned from it you know i i i wish there weren't war [laughter]|agent:so i i i do think that|user:exactly	uh-huh	1
agent:but i believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right i don't remember that feeling back in Vietnam|user:right|agent:uh yeah there's a lot of people that aren't for war i'm not for war	right	1
agent:giving a soapbox to stand on [laughter] [noise] but|user:you know|agent:uh	yeah [laughter]	1
agent:[vocalized-noise] this is going to be very bo[ring]- boring because i don't|agent:w[ell]-|user:hi	you don't at all	1
agent:uh-huh|user:most of m[y]- my forms of exercise come in the form of a five year old and a two year old|user:oh yeah	and uh running after them or going biking with them or just exploring you know on a little explor[ation]- exploration hike	0
user:was a boy scout and|user:well that's neat my uh my husband was uh|agent:exist somehow	he uh	0
user:so we weren't concerned about it and we just sat and watched it and we explained you know how it did well that night she had a nightmare and she has been|user:or she had never seen one we my husband and i had but sh[e]- we'd never seen one as a family and so we just sat and watched it for the longest time [vocalized-noise] it was you know removed from us by probably five or six feet|agent:oh what a shame	terrified of spiders since	0
agent:well that [vocalized-noise] you couldn't pick a better way of doing it|user:really have that much time in it so we just enjoy what we can along with our family you know|user:um	well	1
agent:foundling fathers of uh of Florida found out that they were losing beaucoup bucks|agent:so they are are uh you know really putting it to the visitors and people got a little fed up with it and they sudd[enly]- and suddenly the the|agent:and hotels	by night	1
agent:i have graduated from sleeping on the ground to uh going in a motor home|agent:now uh i'm alone now myself and and uh i|user:um-hum	oh um-hum	1

agent:and it's so easy to convert from one set of units to another|user:yes|agent:uh it just m[akes]- absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all decimal	um-hum um-hum	1
user:um were more able than we were except i think that they probably just said well we're just going to start using the things now|user:and uh [laughter] well i mean it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they they saw the light um i don't know why they we[re]-|agent:that's right it's all their fault	and you sort of have to force people to change since they don't want to	0
agent:but human nature being such as it is|agent:no i- i think that would be the easiest way|user:you don't	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	all right i i think our experience of camping is i i am the the passive member i get things ready	0
agent:even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun isn't it|agent:yeah but e[ven]-|user:kind of organize you know	it is isn't it it isn't ha[ve]- what kinds of things have you tried	1
agent:well that's great|user:i mean you know he did it up really good [laughter] and so uh after he took that merit badge he did all the shopping and preparing getting ready for it|agent:oh	it was it was a marvelous experience because after that then all i had to do was uh follow the instructions you know and do and we did a lot of interesting kinds of things like i	0
agent:and that's how we got started we did it for years and years uh|user:[laughter]|agent:and bought a tent	huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:and w[e]- uh in uh Allendale and uh and uh Waldwick it's just about twelve miles south of the New York border|agent:oh where abouts	and we'd go up to the Adirondacks and camp and it was so you know pick your own	0
user:and uh and there's uh a lot of trees lot of mountains and lot of uh hiking|agent:uh-huh|user:fairly near by you don't have to go very far	sort of things and and we had uh collapsible boat which we	0
agent:oh yes definitely|user:well we don't we don't camp quite as much as we used to but uh i still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family and|agent:yeah	and enjoy nature and	0
agent:[laughter]|user:but a lot of women are are knowl[edge]- as knowledgeable about pro football as i am|user:[noise]	can i guess your favorite team if you had one might be the Steelers	0

agent:but uh i think they still have a little i think they're still such a a young team i think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential|user:uh-huh|agent:i don't know i hope they they do better they they during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better	yeah	1
user:uh-huh|agent:Mike Webster was left but then he he just left|agent:i think	yeah	1
agent:well who would you say is your favorite player or has ever been your favorite player|user:participate at that level if you know|user:or not be able to	ever been	1
agent:yeah him and Franco Harris i really didn't care for the either two of them i mean they were good but i you know you couldn't deny that but i didn't i thought you know well i just didn't really care for either one of them|user:and boy he never gave up i'll tell you|agent:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:yeah i love watching that then i like watching their bloopers too you know [laughter]|user:yeah highlights yeah uh-huh	yeah yeah that's kind of funny [laughter-too] as a matter of [laughter-fact] [noise] some of them a a bit embarrassing	1
user:uh-huh|agent:you know and to me he does um oh he's just so big and fat he doesn't even look like he's in shape he's just so big no one can move him|user:such a temper	that's right	0
agent:uh-huh|user:they wa[tch]- the coaches watch him all year long they they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not you know completely out of control|agent:wow	but i guess most every team has so[me]- has someone like that i don't know	1
user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh sure|agent:yes he is i i i enjoy watching him also	absolutely	1
agent:yeah|user:as the players get older|agent:uh-huh	get slower	1
agent:oh|user:uh professional career only lasts seven years|user:yeah i read some time well not too long ago that the average	so that's when you think about it that's really not a very long time	0
agent:uh-huh|user:you know cards right and do some good investments they'll you know they'll do all right|user:of course they play their	but a lot of them don't unfortunately	1
agent:oh really so they have n[o]- i didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas|user:eventually they may try to push it through|user:income tax for those who don't have it that is i mean we don't have one yet but	no no state income tax	1
agent:but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something|agent:having kids as a deduction and after|agent:what winds up happening is for instance having kids you know they wind up	uh-huh	1
user:what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is|user:uh i don't know how we're going to do that right away though but|agent:i agree	it's just taking uh [noise] a bite out of our savings	1
user:a lot of people have become too complacent and|agent:to see if we could sort of clean them up and you know but i don't know if we can do that or not|user:yeah	believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and	1
user:well there's no quick solution or no sure fire|agent:so i don't know i i i have no idea what to do about it|user:hum	easy answer	0
user:limit|user:to|user:vote	the way it's spent	1
agent:especially around bonus time|user:yeah|agent:and you know when i get her job um you know we we look at her paycheck i'm just floored when i see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep	bonus time you have a bonus	1
user:yeah|agent:and hope that it gets better|agent:i don't know i d[on't]- i guess i guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it	well i have	1
agent:and uh my youngest is twelve|user:oh|agent:uh my oldest two are already out and about in the world and i uh have a set of twins that are fourteen	that's great i always thought it'd be great to have twins	1
user:right|user:oh|agent:noticed i wasn't around that much you know with all the children around the house it's kind of hard to notice that dad isn't around very much [noise]	[laughter]	1
agent:a me kind of attitude|agent:i notice that uh when i had spent two years down in Dallas down there they all have a uh|agent:it's been difficult to try to find the time and i think it's important that we do because um	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh|agent:she just recently started working uh she worked a job until we moved to our new house and uh she quit that job because it was too inconvenient and uh she starts a new job tomorrow which should take her out of the house about four days a week	huh	1
user:we try to take a vacation with them every year|user:and uh|agent:uh-huh	camping of some sort something that wasn't expensive	1
user:uh-huh|agent:you know he uh he worked a full-time job and a part-time job and i never saw him|agent:and uh	uh-huh	1
user:right right|agent:the mental capacity to raise them [laughter] and|agent:the capability to uh create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the uh	now our daughter our well she's our second oldest she has she's the only that other one that has children she has two boys	0
user:so i don't know i i don't think i ever would have had|user:it seems for them that it works out all right|user:and and so it seems	what it would take to work full time and raise a family	1
agent:and so i've uh prior to that i uh i worked in a food store|user:uh|agent:yeah	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah i uh started back to school in fact i was going to school while i was working fifty one hours a week and that's why i you know|agent:yeah i uh|agent:[laughter]	uh-huh	1
user:but uh|agent:uh-huh|user:same job as he was doing only he's retired and doing it independently	nevertheless retired	1
agent:however|user:i'm not a good candidate for this one i see what you see and i agree with you|user:i have i'm really torn on the subject	well the other side i see	0
agent:well|user:probably they don't have birth control|agent:however if you were living in Mexico in those conditions would you have several children	they have no concept of it	0
agent:uh-huh|user:i can i can understand just a little bit of Cuban English|agent:uh	just a little bit	0
user:is just encouraging them to drop out later on|agent:yeah|user:i really do and it's only fair to the children i think making giving the children an out that they don't have to speak English	because they'll never make it through high school	0
agent:uh-huh|user:that are just conceived and produced and dropped on society|user:there are too many children	without	0
agent:uh-huh|user:that as at the time when there were starving people in India i believe|user:and basically the question started out	and the question was should we save these people	1
agent:uh-huh|user:one|user:but we cannot save them w[e]- you know okay we can save	and that's good but what's you know	1
agent:and it had been used for Papa Doc's daughter's wedding|agent:church diocese had poured thousands of dollars into Haiti|user:um	uh-huh	0

user:in that episode|user:the white police officers when the b[lack]- the black guy from Philadelphia went down there were much more bigoted and more the villains|user:were	and now over the time in the television show they're all very much	0
agent:whether they decided to do away with the the racial problem as the main thrust of it or whether they were going to show that eventually that would die down somewhat that um|agent:if they did that intentionally or if they just had uh|user:right	right i i don't know either i don't [vocalized-noise]	1
user:oh oh the All in the [Ha/Family] Family right right right|agent:no the uh the All in the Family reruns that are sh[owing]- showing now they they really take whatever point they're wanting to make they they reiterate it over and over you know it's as if the the intelligence level of the people that watch this or something other they handle over a wide you know range of of uh topics but uh|user:course the this is The Heat of the Night isn't it	right	1
user:antiquated uh the rednecked uh|user:the Archie Bunker with his uh|user:and then uh	ideas i don't know it	0
agent:um do you read the newspaper|user:most of it is TV|agent:so how do you keep up with the news	yes i do we get a daily and then i get uh the Wall Street Journal also	1
agent:fear|user:uh|user:too quick to try to get a scoop and not checking facts out and i think that's probably a a good relevant	fear of all of it yeah i didn't see a movie a long time ago but it was about	1
user:i was um listening to the radio the other day and that|user:and radio is sort of a catch up in fact|agent:[noise] uh	they were reporting on	0

user:or even if you had two kids you would be paying|user:you know so many women could not afford like you said if you had four kids|user:but the reason they had to do this was because so many people	all your salary	0
agent:i realized that once i used i should have i was going to go in the kitchen and and punch one on the touchtone|user:y[eah]- right|agent:if if it's a what kind of phone do they ta[lk]- it['s]- not a dial but if it's a touchtone it's okay	uh-huh	1

user:population|user:um there's uh a large minority|agent:um-hum	and um	0
agent:[laughter-that's] true|agent:yeah|user:and just watching them get better you know that's not much of a challenge	but	1
agent:they were in the final four don't watch basketball|user:[noise] i don't get down there very often|agent:oh well [laughter]	oh really	0
user:i know|agent:ah i can't wait to [laughter-graduate] either now i got all these stuff due oh wow|user:i couldn't wait to graduate and have it be all over	[laughter]	0
user:so i'm not sure how anybody checks up on that but um|agent:ah|user:an[d]- i think they're regulated by the state as to how many they can take in at one time	i think there's a maximum number of kids that they can take care of at any one time	1
agent:well how would i do that|user:i think that's a big question|user:if say if you were in the [vocalized-noise] in a situation having to locate a uh child care center how old you go about determining whether somebody was competent or not take care of your kids	yeah you um pretty much by word of mouth uh somebody recommends somebody else but if you didn't know anybody	0
user:with these other um companies um very expensive rates but they can drop their kid off uh|user:where if they can't get there regular uh sitter or a child care service to take there kids if they reserve slots|user:for some of their uh uh important employees	at uh one of these places for	0
agent:you know still have a little income to help out financially but they want to spend time with their children so they're part timers|agent:uh depending on the responsibilities that we're giving them and to see how that will workout because they all want to|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
EMPTY	[noise]	1
user:i have to admit most of that is uh strong personal distaste i|user:in terms of fair restricting guns and|user:um i guess on a o[ne]- a [laughter-scale] of one to ten i'm probably around a two [laughter]	don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very very little effort	1
agent:and here here here you go here you this will be border line NRA which i am not a member of|agent:anywhere across this country|agent:and here in Houston as well as just about any big city	okay okay	1
user:you don't want to have someone making a personal choice in that way|user:what i don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because_1 pretty soon it's [laughter] it wouldn't|user:um-hum um-hum	i would hope i mean because_1 that means someone the personal sheriff doesn't like doesn't get to have a gun and someone the personal sheriff [vocalized-noise]	1
user:well that makes a lot of since to me i mean i certainly feel that if if we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm but uh i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm they have as much responsibility to know how to do|agent:handle the weapon how to safely handle the weapon how to properly maintain it the three basics|agent:properly	use it safely as someone learns how to drive	1
agent:has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course i can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or unc[oncealed]- unconcealed|user:um-hum|agent:if a citizen of the state being myself	um-hum	1
user:you know uh f[ar]- far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them_1 effectively and everything|agent:if i'm [vocalized-noise] draw at the same time|user:well i'm i'm sure i'm sure given given all your training i'm sure that you know you'd [laughter] if i walk into a bad neighborhood i'm sure i'd want to walk through with you because i'm sure you have good	um i'm quite concerned that if you let everyone who hasn't yet used a gun in a f[elony]- uh haven't hasn't yet committed a felony if you let them all walk around carrying guns in this sort of wild west scenario you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature you're going to start getting a lot of gunfire	1
user:no i i understand that|agent:i won't even blink|agent:anybody trie[s]- anybody tries to hurt them	what if uh what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake	1
user:well i think the idea of public uh health services is a good one i think that we all|agent:okay Janet could you tell me what your thoughts are|user:okay	um perhaps have a civic duty but i don't know as though it should be uh and i don't know if this uh was my interpretation was that perhaps it should be uh like a forced thing	0
agent:right|user:and and uh|user:well that's true and of course there was the need there and they didn't have any other resource	i guess it it served it's purpose	0
user:but uh|agent:yeah i think i think we need it in this country|agent:uh yeah like yeah	yes i- i agree i so mu[ch]- so many of our things are going outside the country to benefit other nations and okay that's fine but what about here	1
agent:that's all more manpower and and one of the ways where we're we were coping with that was they were going into the military and they were getting [noise] a semblance of an education|user:um-hum|agent:that that can't get into college either they can't afford it or or perhaps they don't have the abilities	right	1
agent:Kennedy had a national program to land uh a man on the moon|agent:we could do that too i mean we could we could get a national program|agent:i don't know if it was if it was if it was Johnson or Kennedy or sometime before them the way they decided that yes we're going to have uh [vocalized-noise] i guess we've got some of the best roads in the world	um-hum	1
agent:yeah it just seems to be a waste of time|user:really like you say something needs to be done about that too|user:in reality there's so much more traffic and so many more lines and	um-hum	1
agent:so what's the incentive for them to go to work|user:that's very true|agent:ordinary jobs	yes exactly	1
agent:[laughter] and thank goodness she hadn't worn them out anywhere you know she hadn't taken them_1 to school or|user:they never do [laughter]|agent:she said these just aren't comfortable they hurt [laughter-i] [laughter-said] [laughter-why] [laughter-didn't] [laughter-they] [laughter-hurt] [laughter-in] [laughter-the] [laughter-store]	yeah	1
user:at a store and it was missing a piece there's a a clip that goes with them|user:that we got um|user:car seat	that uh i guess	1
agent:huh that's interesting|agent:so|user:so they just don't bother to put them_1 in in all of them_1 [laughter]	so they probably get a lot of that you know	1
agent:and and say well mark it down and i'll b[uy]- i'll buy it as it is even if it is damaged because it's repairable|user:uh-huh|agent:i[tem]- item so that you could afford to go buy the glue or the special thread it was going to take or the patch or whatever you know	yeah	1
agent:in quality|agent:pressure to compete|agent:um	um-hum	1
agent:you know and just a wide variety wide wide variety|user:yeah|agent:the difference	um-hum	1
user:true yeah i think they're|agent:measure up|agent:doesn't always	they're trying to lower costs by cheapening	0
user:uh they set at my dining room table easily|user:okay uh [laughter] we i find that the nicest party for dinner uh uh group for a dinner party is eight people|user:[noise]	and it just seems like you can decorate a table and and you can serve easily with eight people	0
agent:um-hum|user:aft[er]- after your guests are here and you've started cocktails really|agent:yeah	uh us[ually]- course you have to have some kind of entertainment too and and we do play bridge my husband plays	1
user:we can do that|user:yeah|agent:yeah or a barbecue or something like that yeah	well starting the end of this well starting now we can do that through October	0
user:what do you do uh|agent:that's true yeah|user:party i think	for a barbecue when you cook out what's your favorite thing	1
agent:um-hum|user:enchiladas and all that stuff but|agent:yeah	okay_1 a ca[n]- a sixteen ounce can of beer and then you mix eight ounces of Italian dressing with it do you let the beer get flat or	1
agent:like warm your um flour tortillas up in the oven|agent:and then you|user:okay	uh-huh okay	1
agent:the hottest [laughter] yeah [laughter]|agent:um-hum|user:every time they and they always come here for every holiday it seems and birthdays and and every time we always have to start up with something really hot and spicy as an hors d'oeuvres and it gets to be both our son sons-in-law are good cooks and enjoy cooking and it kind of gets to be a contest to see who can come up with the	right [laughter] the hottest almost not eatable hors d'oeuvres [laughter-to] [laughter-start] [laughter-us] [laughter-out] so well it's fun take talking to you i'm going to try fajitas	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh|user:i've been retired from TI about a year but the program you know was still fairly new i guess it had been going on maybe almost a year before i retired so i was not	uh ever called upon to do a drug test i certainly wouldn't object to it	0
user:Defense Electronic Division when i retired i know it was a you know it was a real hot hot item there i think i want to think maybe they you know|user:you know s[ome]- do some sort of you know drug testing i think that's really what maybe prompted TI to do it i was in the uh|agent:uh-huh	really got some nudging from you know D O D to do this sort of thing	1
agent:put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself|user:put you out on the street|agent:yeah rather than just uh	yeah	1
agent:uh they were really opposed to it and you know there was a few of them that obviously|user:oh yeah uh-huh|agent:here a lot of them are real opposed to it	uh-huh	1
user:[noise]|agent:why are we doing this well so you don't kill people on the road|user:that's right yep yep	that's right or yourself or	1
agent:would help out and i think in the long run we all benefit|agent:so there's a there's a lot of sectors where i think that would|user:absolutely	uh-huh oh absolutely yeah	1
agent:and and start it up|user:uh-huh|agent:i i just hope that uh more and more companies uh get on the ball	i think they probably will you know if they i'm sure it's a very expensive program to administer	1
user:no|agent:you know the company's not going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent they're going to reduce their own|user:uh-huh	no	0
agent:uh that you know they probably need to change it somehow uh the whole system needs changing we've just got too many people in there|agent:that's not a bad idea i um|user:[noise] well i don't kn[ow]- i mean i don't know what you think about this subject i [noise] the i had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the the sentencing to uh to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that i've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while we was waiting for them_1 to find somebody and [noise] i don't know that that's not a good idea	i agree	1
user:[noise] i look at the i look at what you know this what were the aid we're sending to the Kurds and i- i feel sorry for them_1 and i know they're suffering and i know they're dying every day but|agent:you're very accurate|user:it's just not working	we've got	0
agent:uh-huh|user:not um i wonder sometimes [laughter] um but we um we house sat for a|agent:but not cats	um my um my wife's boss a couple weeks ago and um	0
agent:limited [laughter]|user:so you know they're not you w[orry]- you're not worried about them running all around the neighborhood and you know they you know they they make their mess in the cat pan which is|agent:uh-huh	yeah it's you know it's a pain to clean but you know we used to i mean they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans they didn't	0
agent:for me well my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a [laughter-cat] [laughter-because] that's all there is to it so you know|agent:but i think that|agent:and she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals	[laughter]	0
user:uh-huh|agent:and i don't know if we got rid of the dog because_1 my brother was allergic to it my brother had asthma and some allergies which i think he's outgrown now but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards and then he had fish|agent:trying to remember we had a dog for a while	uh-huh	1
user:i forget how she got it|agent:uh-huh|user:i had a friend in college who had a um had a pet rat for a while um	but it was um it was the same kind of a deal i think she got it i think she was a psych major and she got it from the psych department	1
agent:i mean people do|agent:certainly certainly not a dog|user:right	oh people	0
EMPTY	[noise]	0
user:yeah yeah and it gives you a sense um a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say oh well i don't have to pay for it now|agent:that's true if if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket and sometimes you may think well i don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something|user:they have this weird opinion that if you use that card you don't have to pay for it	but you're going to have to pay for it and it seems like	1
user:you know and i'm i'm thinking|agent:um|user:and my husband's sister is the world's worst at oh well i'll just use the credit cards and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit	woman [laughter] wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you	0
user:and you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them_1 any uh interest now it's|user:that you use it|user:because they give you a certain amount every time	and people say well you know i'm making money	1
user:so|user:right they don't have one of those|user:yeah	it we decided that was it you know and i mean everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card we have we could have credit cards running out our ears	1
user:but it this is her first credit card thing well when she got her first one she was so excited it was unreal look at this they sent me this money you know|agent:uh-huh|user:young people if they don't you know we take the time to you know help my daughter she's in college	so then when i explained to her look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest and stuff of course she [ter/tore] tore it up	0
user:you know|user:to|user:and um it's just unreal i mean i don't like credit cards i wish that they would come up with some other way	the only way you could use them_1 is if you were	1
agent:[noise] yeah|user:what is the matter with this person [laughter] but um|user:that's how you got on to it to start with you know	it seems like people just you know they just think well	0
user:ever and maybe suffer from having to pay out|user:and knowing that i was going to have to pay this thing out for|user:i could not charge to the limit	but that's just the way i feel about it	1
agent:well we're geared to that we're like okay like i want a living room set and instead of sitting back and and going okay well it's going to cost maybe a thousand dollars two thousand dollars and i'll save for two years people go oh well i'll just go buy it put it on credit and i'll pay it off|user:well i had everything when i was at home but i i don't know why i didn't [laughter]|user:you know i didn't feel like that i didn't feel like i had to have everything i guess it was because	um-hum	1
agent:yeah|user:we're being recorded already|agent:yeah i just dial one	okay uh we're supposed to be discussing our homes	1
agent:the the wood shingle roofs are phasing out here they're very they're good for air-conditioning you know they they|user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh	i hear you	1
agent:uh i live in Arlington actually this i'm working tonight actually in Dallas uh|user:uh-huh|agent:it it it's not it's not really that typical it's a custom home	uh-huh uh-huh	1
agent:do you have a basement|user:yeah well most the homes here are two story because uh they stack them up since the property is so expensive at least in the Maryland area where i am|agent:yeah that that i heard i know those words from the east when i was there but that they don't use that word here	yeah	1
user:uh|agent:yeah|user:they build them here so you get about a twenty two hundred to three thousand square foot home depending on whether you include the basement or not	on about	0
agent:yeah this is Dallas there the water's down two thousand feet|user:so it's just a matter they just don't do it|agent:no no it's not very high some of the water here	uh-huh	1
user:okay that's what they call a split level up here|agent:right right|agent:right	and a split foyer is where all the steps are at the entrance way	1
user:then the second house i owned had gas heat and gas stove and uh|agent:uh-huh|user:[laughter] i've been through two or three different things of them first house i came up here had gas heat with electric stove	um even gas water heater whereas my previous home it had electric water heater	1
user:yeah|agent:people i think probably prefer natural gas for for heating|agent:oh yeah	uh-huh i would too because me i like gas heat i love it	1
agent:right|user:which you have to rely on with uh conventional stove or or a warm-up time i mean it's instantly there|user:time	and that kind of response is quite uh quite effective i think for cooking	1
agent:i i i wish i had that you know|user:they're sort of coming back up here in the east|agent:yeah yeah oh yeah	front porches are they're not very big but they're kind of coming back	1
agent:our our weather is like we have a we have a the wa[rm]- raining season is now is April|user:i didn't know you were that far inland i knew it was a ways but|agent:yeah	uh-huh uh-huh	0

agent:yeah|user:exactly|user:in the area	and um	0
agent:changes by region as far as it's emphasis is concerned middle of the country would be wheat land here it's tobacco|agent:type of emphasis now agriculture|agent:different set of instructors on it and a little different outlook and plus there are regional differences i think too California may have a different	right	1
user:here in North Carolina but i hopefully will go to California to receive a PhD in uh|user:i'm graduating with just a soil science degree|user:well	soil science with a specialization in environmental [vocalized-noise] environmental quality	0

user:just to know|user:just|agent:uh-huh	what's	1
user:i|user:uh situational|agent:the the the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you dec[ide]- decide on a pass	i doubt i'll be here in six months	1
user:i|agent:[laughter] well actually uh the the the Plano Dallas Houston you know Austin that whole area is is actually quite quite nice|user:but then they they tell me hell is much better than west Texas	my little brother lives in Austin right now	1

agent:right|user:we can do a good um twenty twenty five dollar night out and have a decent steak and it comes out okay|agent:yes	uh	0
agent:uh as you said you out on the t[own]- now when we go out it's it's you want it to be more special [laughter] you don't want to just uh necessarily run out for|agent:when we do go out|user:right	um-hum	1
user:and they'll the entire place is|agent:uh-huh|user:oh i don't know a motif to the entire uh shopping center it's the anchor for this entire strip shopping center i guess	um	0
agent:uh places have not caught up with the population here and so we do have a problem of the the half decent restaurants when you go on a Friday or Saturday night you're looking for quite a long wait|agent:um some of the commercial um|agent:i don't know if you've been in this area in the last few years but it's just been incredible and and has it's gone crazy i mean where we are was basically a farm ten years ago and it's houses are stacked and what has happened really is that	hum	1
agent:that's interesting i went to a smaller school [noise] of probably|user:i don't know different languages different cultures and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students|user:different uh	um-hum	1
agent:yeah|user:um because_1 like we would have biology classes that did main courses that everyone has to take i mean hundreds of students in this class so actually yes you were a number|agent:sort of thing	but um i i just i don't know i'm thinking in a sense of uh	1
agent:larger university setting|agent:um|agent:and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this	um-hum	1
agent:but it's these other things that you and i are are keying off on that that are really|agent:the education|agent:with uh uh accredita[tion]- accreditation to give	uh-huh	1
agent:and i was looking at an annual last night uh something had s[parked]- it sparked a question and i went to a|user:um-hum|agent:i i'm i'm older than you i've been out for twenty one years	um-hum	1
agent:and it's it's it's kind of neat just knowing that|user:that's great|user:wow	um-hum	1
user:which is y[eah]- yeah yeah so she you know that's probably you know what she what she wants anyway but|agent:i was going to ask who won [laughter]|agent:uh-huh	that was the big deal and	1
agent:i- i guess i guess it was it was my mother's support that got me through it that and ten years of of uh loans [laughter] [laughter-after] i got [laughter-out] [laughter]|agent:um|agent:so	yeah	1
user:that that's what you need the most i'm finding out now that what i'm needing the most now is not smarts not what i can do on paper|user:when you when you do want when you do finally graduate|user:right because	it's stamina	0
user:i mean it's better than it used to be but it's incredible that they still|user:industry pollution and you know they're reg[ulation]- they're regulation that's placed on them is|user:that's the problem but also like you said the	don't have you know	0
user:and i don't you know wh[en]- when you consider|agent:yeah|agent:those chemicals would not	you know it's probably not radioactive but toxic can be	0
agent:and they're you know they're right there on the creek also and uh they've been there for years|agent:we've got Imperial sugar but uh|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:uh-huh|user:when you know you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it and they've added humus and stuff that breaks it down and and this and this article said that they've got a real problem that um you've got toxins and and uh bacteria in the manure that is|user:that you know i[f]- people think well cow manure is good for fertilizer but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not it's not	what it's doing is it's going through uh they don't have a very deep um	0
agent:cow manure was going to be bad|agent:[laughter-right] i was going to say the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of|agent:oh now that's bad	yeah but i i don't know it really frightens me though as far as the	0
EMPTY	okay now uh the	0
user:yeah|agent:is this like roadside collection|user:what the they were doing uh	i don't think they really uh encouraged it i don't think they really uh	0
user:really brought stuff to it all the time|user:that has been taken away it's not there anymore i mean that thing was always full because people|user:but uh	and uh then they took it away for no real reason that i can understand or i ever heard about	0
agent:right|agent:yeah|user:be that if you well like grocery stores you buy uh pop and and you had a deposit on the bottle you bring the bottle back you get a nickel per bottle back or whatever	you know that encourages you not to throw it away you'd take it back and and	0
agent:two liter Coke bottles or whatever|user:hum|agent:you just can't throw that in with your	i wasn't aware of that i thought they were more or less all the same	1
user:uh you know just scattered throughout the city|user:or or two thousand people|user:five thousand people	you know who who wouldn't mind just you know why going down that way anyway just throw things in the back of your car and	0
agent:yeah it is|user:the companies now save like what fifteen thousand trees or whatever because of that and i thought that's great|user:you know and i read that	you know	1
agent:you know fifty thousand versus twenty thousand on materials because your|agent:to do you know if you were building a house and you were going to spend|agent:for it it's easy to say but for a lot of people	yeah	1

user:so i own uh a PCAT	at my home	1
agent:uh well i'm i'm a technician electronics tech and years ago TI sent me to their uh computer school down in Austin|agent:i uh|agent:well [noise] excuse me	hum-um	1

user:that's the deal is you're not buying brands now you're buying these knock offs|user:well that's the|user:and	so there's uh probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one there's there's a magazine called Computer Shopper	0
agent:um-hum|user:they're available in you know the B Daltons that that type of thing|agent:i see how do you go about getting one of those uh catalogs	you'll notice it in that it's it's a it's a v[ery]- it's although it's a magazine it's large and like i said it's about an inch thick	1
user:w[ell]- wh[at]-|agent:so what do you uh uh work with uh computers uh at TI|user:[laughter] i understand that's great that's a good joke	i did for years and then i was was a scientist over in central research labs and just recently i've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing	0

agent:yeah|agent:and you know|user:right um-hum and even down to the death penalty i think as far as	you know appeal after appeal after appeal i think they've finally began to say you know enough's enough	1
agent:the time they're out of jail between|user:um-hum|agent:spending time in jail and i think they even give credit sometimes for the	um-hum	1
agent:take on the responsibility themselves|agent:you know then they don't|agent:they they want to put so much restrictions on and and and	that's right	1
agent:smaller area|agent:we said you know that we'd have been a lot better off our children would have been a l[ot]- a lot better off being raised in a smaller|agent:yeah it's uh	um-hum	1
agent:so|agent:yeah|agent:yeah	it really is	1
agent:that's uh my wife said the other day said she just couldn't do that couldn't be a police officer because you're you know you never know|agent:well|user:that's got to be discouraging especially_1 if you've risked your life to to do course you know if you're a cop you expected to risk your life	that's right	1
user:um that's right|user:um-hum|agent:yeah you you've got a they get a a domestic uh violence or do[mestic]- domestic dispute and they get there and both of the parties turn on them	apparently it's very very dangerous situation	1
agent:that's that's what i like about music|user:what|agent:it's just enjoying the melody	okay what separates that from something such as jazz music or you know	1
agent:a lot of groups don't like to be called new age because it's kind of a a label|agent:no uh that's really|agent:no	uh-huh	1
agent:kind of a jazz new age|user:okay i was wondering|agent:well yeah he's kind of a new age	all right	1
user:um|agent:what what what kind of music do you like to listen to mostly|user:well that's cool	i'm very um	0
agent:yeah|user:pretty cool on that and you know with the videos and stuff now coming out|user:i like it you know it's you've got some top forty hits and i'm sure you know he's geared to that but there are some songs that are	he may be softening up little bit but you know i still like his voice and	0
agent:yeah|user:yeah unless you have someone that can loan it to you or you go to the library and listen to it|agent:excuse me	it's kind of hard just to	1
agent:i i hardly ever listen to the radio anymore|user:did you|agent:and that's pretty much all i listen to	did you say one oh six	0
user:me generation has gone far too far|user:uh i think this|user:and i don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective	and the young people are overly impressed	0
user:volunteer work for teachers|user:some type of college uh|user:out on a limb here	that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching	0
agent:um-hum|user:but we could find one we wouldn't have to drive|agent:yeah	and spend the night someplace or something like that	0
user:right right|agent:if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it|agent:what it's like	um	1
user:and maybe this is why this has died out|user:i'm wondering if there's another issue here|user:but	can you go into and this wasn't the question but it's it may be the more of the issue versus should	0
user:if you step back from the current issue|agent:yeah|user:i- i i don't know that um	and look at it	0
user:there's a German word for it that's elegant but i never can remember what it was uh|user:of being winnowed out|user:and i'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there	but but they're they're being winnowed because they're where they are they're not adapted to their environment	0
user:and their belief system and a[ll]- all their structured|user:because their society isn't there anymore|user:uh i felt sorry for them_1	of theirs all the structures of their society are gone	1
agent:and that's not really the answer i mean because_1 if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that but|agent:more money to these people i mean|agent:what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give um	yeah that's exactly it	1
agent:uh i guess i've had to return something but i'm ca[n't]- can't decide mostly it's been because i didn't like the color	uh-huh	1

user:and we went back and we talked to the technical person a second time and things like that|user:and so we said fine|user:this doesn't really work anyway and etcetera and they're and they were doing it at their own costs	and then we come	1
agent:i think that's the worst part uh i|user:right|agent:right and t[ime]- and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction	so well actually some things are pretty good with that because i put it on a gold credit card and i just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation and they said well you don't have to pay for it yet	1
agent:yeah they will|user:but they'll just you know|agent:no	undo the credit that they did to them	1
agent:yeah no i think this is a i think this is maybe a name brand and i suspect that it's probably just a fluke you know|agent:uh|user:but i was wondering like you know in our case we we knew we were buying a copy we weren't buying an IBM PC and i was wondering if you	[noise]	1
agent:repair work to do on them_1|agent:the fact that they that they ha[ve]- have competition with the Japanese and whatnot sometimes uh dwells on a fact that you know uh i've had i've known people who have had Toyotas for years that have had almost no|agent:right	um-hum	1

user:no|user:um|agent:pop cans and things like that	there's there's only one pop machine and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now so	1

user:trucks and stuff|user:the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage|user:rather than bag it up because of a[ll]- all the	and it's uh i guess a lot more e[cological]- ecological to just	1
agent:our garbage isn't being decomposed that was a shocker to me|agent:but i didn't realize that|agent:i was surprised	yeah well there are a lot of things that aren't i'm that's uh one of the things i wonder about uh one of the questions was	1
agent:uh-huh|user:but the cost is is like double or sometimes triple|user:and lawn additives and that type of thing	what the regular things you fertilizers and things you buy	1
user:i i'd heard something stranger talk about bottles|user:yeah|agent:that's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway [laughter] you have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf you haven't got enough nerve to say well put it back it's not recyclable	the other day on uh	0
user:or contract when the weather changes and [laughter] this is kind of an unusual use for|user:they don't expand or|agent:oh	that type of thing	1
agent:you know what i'd like to see a little more i don't have any little tiny kids|user:serious the problem is and how important it is to do that|user:in front of the public so they understand how	uh-huh	1
agent:you know it's not|agent:but people are certainly having their children their families later|user:[noise]	uh yeah in some cases uh	1

user:with TV and radio and uh|agent:oh yeah|user:passed on a lot quicker with	uh children are under a lot more pressure because from their peers than	0
user:yeah|agent:right at the same time they're getting them_1 you know six weeks later|user:that's right	yeah	1
user:most of them were on farms i guess or they worked in factories|user:uh they|user:no it it goes back i guess way way back [noise] people had a lot of children and they and they they were kind of	at least in the east you know my father my grandfather and his father before him	1
agent:um|agent:i think probably m[ain]- a lot of it was you know contract labor|user:labor is to to take care of the crops	because the kids wanted something more i guess	1
user:uh what's the word i want more|user:i know uh that Texas laws are more|user:[noise]	r[eal]- i think realistic because they do believe in capital punishment and they do every once in awhile	0
user:you know i'm just not even aware of what the law is it's uh been so long since anyone was executed that|user:they have uh uh|agent:do they have a law on the books up there	it might be legal	0
user:they uh [noise] i th[ink]- to me i think they have to come to that with|user:uh-huh|agent:doesn't even fit the crime but you can't get any worse	uh as you say brutal crimes because of the prison system being so crowded	0
agent:i don't know personally i'll never be in that position|user:um|agent:pretty painful way to go i don't know	well we certainly hope not	1
user:but i have a friend who's is a school teacher and she has a nine year old girl in her room who is suffering abuse and the mother is aware of it and is not|user:i can't imagine uh a mother standing by and watching something destructive happen to her children|user:where you would think there might not be the help uh there is help for women who are abused or children who are abused or whatever uh	protecting the child which just makes your skin crawl to even think about it but	1
agent:it j[ust]- just doesn't seem uh|user:uh-huh|agent:suffering as they have for for no reason and they're going to do it again if they get the chance	i guess the most frightening thing to me uh you're probably young enough that you've not aware of the Richard Speck case uh it happened in	0
user:he should i think have made that his life should have been sacrificed for what he took|user:twenty twenty two twenty three year old nurses are all dead it just doesn't seem|user:rehabilitated to the point that he can go back out in society when these young	as you say the punishment has to fit the crime doesn't it	1
user:yeah|agent:on an island so far away there's no chance they can ever get off|user:gotten a little narrow-minded about things like that [laughter]	nice talking to you	0
user:i do you|agent:and therefore i think juries should be able to recommend sentencing|user:i think i agree with that very much	i do you think a lot of people when they are listening to a trial put themselves	0
agent:but uh i was called up as an an alternate once but i never made it to the jury|user:called uh-huh|agent:well now that's possible	uh-huh	1
agent:e[xactly]- exactly|user:that would mean they all would have to decide|agent:i suppose it should be	one way or the other	1
user:uh apparently there are i i i since my husband worked as a policeman|agent:uh we can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials|user:um-hum	i can't believe there are very many	1
agent:and he could have disapp[eared]- uh gotten away at lunch time and uh|user:uh-huh|agent:well they said it w[as]- that this happened during lunch time	well	1
user:and|agent:yes unfortunately that's what happens|user:the guilty people the one's that are on trial	yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:not freedom of action|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:i feel like if they don't people don't like what our flag stands for|user:and uh i i-|agent:um-hum	they're welcome to go some place else	0
agent:well the jury came in with a g[uilty]- guilty verdict and they recommended uh twenty years or something|agent:but uh i know i'm always hearing that uh|user:um-hum	and they recommend some	1
user:um-hum|agent:yeah but too many times they they are per[mitted]- permitted to go out on parole and|user:and a lot of different things i guess	a lot slip through the the protective	0
agent:well here again now there is where race seems to rear its ugly head s[o]- so frequently|agent:uh yeah very true|user:it doesn't make sense	um-hum	0

agent:fairly quick yeah|user:yeah that one nine[ty]-|agent:that really is a nice area when they get that highway f[inished]- finished you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go	that one ninety is just going to be the mo[st]- outer[most]- outermost loop around	1
user:here hang on just a second i've got a Los Angeles map|agent:[noise]|agent:huh	let me just quick	1
agent:people can get in and out of LA f[aster]- easier|agent:and they've built some new highways out to that area and things lately|user:right it's a f[ar]-	maybe it's a place i went to it was uh far extreme thought we'd never find the place	0
agent:yep yep so i yeah i used to play the piano and i like uh Bach and|user:and even every once a while i'd put it on myself you know|user:so i- i had never listened to it bef[ore]- till then but now i listen to it well whenever she does	um	0
agent:um-hum|agent:oh really|user:is totally different you know when yeah because_1 Baltimore'll play more um what might be considered mo[re]- little bit more progressive	and as soon as you go down to Salisbury this town that's you know	0
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:i really didn't notice at all it just seemed the same but when i went more rural you know that it really changed	so	1
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:because_1 she's blind or wha[t]- she's losing her sight or whatever	but yeah that of in i can imagine you know if you're driving cross country	0

agent:yeah but uh that's that's why i like the the outdoor stuff a a lot better people can entertain themselves i think a great deal|agent:yeah|user:but dinner parties are a lot of work uh	[noise]	1
agent:oh it w[ould]- because|user:right|agent:and then you'd simmer it like all day long	you'd get the odor of it yeah	1
agent:um-hum|user:Christmas you know to have a meal|user:remember we were first married and we were living in New Jersey and uh we were going over to my mother's house for	and we were on the way over we were just married that very year and she said oh i'm looking forward to a nice turkey i said turkey	0
agent:and i tell you what if it's never failed to come out tender and juicy and just and just delicious because i normally don't like ham because it's so salty|user:oh really|user:um-hum	oh i haven't heard of that yeah	1
user:and uh actually pierogies and all that stuff that uh|agent:um-hum|user:has uh you know a truck that comes around and and they recently had hams they have steaks and	i- i never i wish i could tell you the name of the company but i don't know what it is but uh they recently had a ham	0

user:uh-huh|agent:and there's a mistrial|user:yes and then there's a mistrial right	yeah i agree with that i really do i	0
agent:is not the stiffer pen[alty]- penalty than the death penalty|agent:life without parole|agent:life in	i agree	1
user:di[d]- made a mistake and he uh|user:i had an experience with that because my i have a brother-in-law that was um|agent:yep	was working as a financial pla[nner]- planner and they the the company he was working for did a few things that was against the law	0
agent:it varies even from state to state and even within state|agent:uh|user:exactly	um-hum	1
agent:and uh|agent:and it's just you know ridiculous|user:isn't that awful	yeah and you know i also feel like if a judge has has the last say	0
agent:right|user:exactly and and the rich people get off the hook [noise]|agent:is more or less at the court's mercy	it's really is sad	1
user:you know i don't think i could be partial in a case like that i ju[st]-|user:and um|user:drunken driving	i just uh	0
agent:give a uh|agent:won't [vocalized-noise]|agent:right away they said well this guy	yeah	1
user:as uh you might think would you know get the book thrown at them or whatever because we're all we all feel the same way but|user:innocent or possibly not as guilty as you know as|user:possibly	i know th[at]- i have some friends that have been on juries that have been deadlocked and it's no fun i mean because	1
agent:it's not perfect but it's better than anything else is|agent:but i guess i guess it's like like a lot of other things in in states uh|user:yeah that would be terrible	exactly yeah	0
agent:yeah um-hum|user:they do all right|agent:[noise] yeah matter of fact it's sort of interesting because_1 they do have uh drug testings at the company i work at	how do you feel about it	1
agent:right|user:drilling oil and gas wells|user:very very hazardous type of uh operation	and there's enough problem with injuries in that	0
agent:now i do know of um two employees that were fired because they they couldn't pass|user:and i think maybe the knowledge that they could have random testing uh may have an effect too|user:yeah it at least run a spot check	um-hum	1
agent:but uh|user:yeah|user:um-hum	did uh	1
user:lots of times getting down to the actual method and and results|user:but|agent:um-hum	uh being evaluated properly	0
agent:yeah yeah i- i missed it this year|user:Cherry Blossom Festival apparently went all right|user:the uh	did you	1
agent:yeah i did too|user:time limit i think is is about up but i enjoyed talking to you Wayne|user:well the uh	all right thank you	0
agent:and the neat thing about the credit card is for every dollar that you charge you get one frequent flyer mile|agent:um|agent:well not given out i mean there's an annual fee	um-hum	1
agent:i refuse to pay interest if i'm going to do that i'm not going to use a credit card|user:um-hum|agent:and just be totally wiped out because one thing i hate is paying interest	exactly	1
agent:it's definitely worth it if you pay off your bills in full then credit cards are a real good idea|agent:um-hum|agent:seem	um-hum	1
user:uh-huh|user:uh that's why i have it [laughter]|agent:J C Penney offered you know a free gift if you buy it yeah or five dollars off this purchase if you you know sign up and	um-hum	1
agent:or you know if i- i- i tend to buy a lot of things from TV like not not the shopper's thing but sometimes they'll be something good that they're selling a record or something like that|agent:one thing that um that does scare me a little bit about my credit card is when i am giving it over the phone|agent:oh just yeah the machine	uh-huh	1
user:yeah|user:um-hum|user:that's good	they usually i think they're usually pretty good about that	1
user:it's like they're addicted to|agent:yeah it's true though because then all they end up doing is spending more of their time making collection calls|user:but i think they should have the the consumer [vocalized-noise] the most interest you know [laughter]	using their credit card or something	1
user:just simply because we as human beings don't have the right|user:uh my first thoughts on capital punishment i[s]- i the first thing i want to say i[s]- is no|user:okay	to take another human being's life	0
user:uh-huh|agent:that that i find very difficult to swallow sometimes|user:ex[actly]-	one thing i don't understand is	0
agent:a human being it doesn't do anyone any good yes people need to be punished and i do agree with your statement|agent:prison is such a waste of|agent:helping the environment i mean	um-hum	1
user:they put four people in a freezer and shot them_1 all|user:uh apparently two teenage boys held up a Taco Bell|agent:oh exactly w[ell]-	now to me that is inhumane	1
user:um-hum|agent:crux of the problem is no one has come up with a solution|agent:but but i think that the whole	right	1
user:to to|agent:e[xactly]-|user:uh rehabilitation programs of some sort something to get	put these people back in society but prepare them first	1
agent:how are we going to make that happen [laughter] [laughter]|agent:how are we going to fix that Tanya [laughter]|user:um-hum	[laughter] really how what can we do	1
agent:and a few people in the news that bring it to us and make us see what's out there|user:yeah|agent:right most of us are so sheltered you know	exa[ctly]-	0
agent:and you're right that has got to be a challenge sometimes|user:um-hum|agent:uh you want you want to you know persuade people to your viewpoint	especially when you are dealing with a a subject like	0
agent:yeah i'm well i'm on i'm taking some vacation this week so it didn't bother me|user:have to go back into work|user:it was one of those days where you wish you uh you didn't want to	[noise]	1

user:yeah you stop and think about what you can do to uh to prevent or reduce crime|agent:uh i don't know what the answers should be per se|user:uh-huh	and in fact tonight uh alone i i got a phone call from one of the security uh	0
agent:i could do that|agent:you know i'm basically a nonviolent person but|agent:uh not so much for me you know i feel like i'm responsible i'd learn how to use it and yes i could shoot someone if you know they were trying to take my kids or take my life or	well there's s[ome]- some	1
agent:that didn't do it but i know that's few and far between|agent:only because there have been ones sent away|user:uh-huh	yeah	1

agent:see you're not aware of the the horror stories and things like that that i've grown up with|user:if i were in that situation i think i would rather live in a in a nursing home situation|user:i don't think i would like that i think i would rather	uh-huh	1

user:i think that for so many people|user:she's still real independent so|agent:oh she drives yeah	that uh	0
user:and they i i think that it would be good for them to be into a situation that|user:they've been uprooted for some reason or another|user:i've seen a lot of people that don't live near their family or don't have you know significant roots in this in their little community	would offer them uh	0

agent:right i i you probably uh|agent:right|agent:yeah	but uh	1
agent:they they come by uh collecting aluminum cans because we have places|user:uh-huh|agent:in fact the there's a the kids at the end of the block come by every once in a while when they want extra money	hm	1
agent:and uh you know and but they they're pretty good about it it doesn't you know you can have the staples in them_1 and the paper clips on them_1 and the plastic windows they take care of all of that but they don't want certain types of paper|user:um-hum|agent:uh they had a big campaign for it and there's a list of things that you're allowed to put in the paper bin	wow	1
user:oh|user:um-hum|agent:with a with a squirrel going up and it's like a a a gauge and the higher the squirrel goes up the more trees you've saved and it shows you how many thousands of trees uh have been saved because of the recycling program at work	[laughter] so like	1
agent:that's right yeah|user:i don't know like you're doing something wrong or you feel guilty almost|user:you feel almost uh	so	0
agent:uh-huh|user:about our landfill here|user:i know i'm doing the s[tory]- big story i'm covering now is of	and uh what was it i think twenty four million tons of garbage that we throw away	0
agent:which is a a park that they built on top of a landfill|user:hm|agent:i know there's place called Mount Tr[ashmore]- Trashmore	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|user:yeah|agent:and there's no way to measure that i mean you you know you the only way is to take the chance and see what happens forty years from now and who knows what kind of havoc you've created	hm	1
agent:yeah no that that is certainly true but i wonder about like like in Canada|user:kind of a government administrative health insurance or medical plan because i just feel like everything the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly and it's going to be about six times more expensive as|user:yeah yeah i feel like there should be some kind coverage made but i i am really leery of um [noise]	what	1
agent:and we picked a primary care physician and just didn't like him you know and|user:right right|agent:yeah i mean like we have an an HMO that allows us to pick our own physicians	uh-huh	1
agent:oh right no|user:and i think hospitals do make money but not nearly as much as insurance companies do i think they are really making a killing and nobody's talking about it|agent:oh yeah	nobody's	1
agent:that'd be nice|user:i wonder if we should have a limit on how much people can sue for|agent:yeah that is a big problem	or [laughter] or i don't know because then that's where the insurance company ben[efits]- if if people weren't having to spend these huge amounts of money on getting insurance coverage	0
user:uh-huh|agent:yeah and as as it turns out my wife has pretty decent coverage through her company and can get me covered as well|user:yep [laughter]	oh great	1
user:uh-huh|agent:for everything i still have to pay them a hundred some odd dollars a semester for the mandatory portion of the insurance|user:yeah	oh no	1
agent:as it turns out um my wife and i have chosen to use the university as|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:right so i'm basically paying for a welfare state now as it turns out	uh-huh	1
user:i mean i can't afford to have some kind of some kind of volun[tary]- optional operation for myself|agent:that's certain true|user:you know	because our our medical coverage has gotten increasingly worse over say the past five years to the point now where even if we need surgery	0
agent:i i i think the tendency is that as people get older|user:uh-hum|agent:yeah it's it's one of the st[range]- i i think it's strange is that as you get older	uh-huh	1
user:yeah|agent:right we have we have federal income tax state income tax local income tax we have state tax on gasoline|user:no no income tax	oh	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah|user:yeah it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty	i know what you mean um	0
user:in order to put|agent:yeah|user:uh commuting the sentences of those that were in in jail for lesser crimes	more people in	0
agent:if it|user:that i think it might make a difference right now i don't see it making a difference i don't see someone not going out there|user:uh	and committing murder because	0
agent:and we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently|agent:the kind of people where we say you know this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society|agent:i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for	yeah	1
agent:not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear|agent:the ver[dict]- sentence on what the person did|agent:and and base	yeah i had my uh my father-in-law participated in a uh	0
user:were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up|user:that they quite literally|user:and uh you know jumbo cookies and and so they were so upset from robbing this guy you know trying to do this holdup that didn't work	and just started	0
user:and of course then they had to go back|agent:[noise]|user:um you know he would come home and and you know after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on	to dec[ide]- you know after	1
agent:as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing|agent:but then you have to decide you know|agent:you know is this man really guilty and you have to decide that	yeah	1
agent:and so i go le[t's]- you know these are the kind of people i would like to ye[ah]- get out of here and get out of circulation and say i don't we don't accept your kind in our society|user:yeah i agree|user:yeah	yeah i agree i i've i have uh a low tolerance for that kind of uh	0
user:uh|user:i mean kidnapping per se has a certain uh|user:um you know when they	fine and penalty associated with it but	0
agent:because_1 i've gotten them all paid off|user:uh-huh|agent:i don't even give myself a tempting	yeah	1
user:cash|agent:ca[sh]- check|agent:um-hum	-[o]kay	1
user:at the end of the month on your balance|user:because_1 they pay in our credit union pays|user:and i can let my money sit in the bank for an extra	so i will let it sit and then draw interest from that	0
user:cash back program and also at the end of the month you know i'll get|user:you know i'll get some of that back through the|user:uh like we[ll]- uh like buying a suit if i spend like three hundred bucks	my interest on that three hundred bucks that was sitting in my checking account that would be gone had i written a check	0
user:and sometimes we order things through the mail like books|user:but that's the only one i have and|user:uh use my credit card	and uh	1
user:they may have got something on sale but all the interest you know|user:finance charges and they just and then they'll pay the minimum balance every month and then end up|user:spend uh they think because they've got a thousand dollar limit then you know they've got to get that limit every month or something and uh they end up paying	they end up paying more than what they would have had they just paid cash for it	1
agent:yeah|agent:right now|user:yeah is that a free service that override	huh	1

user:i know if i have money in the checking account to cover it|user:like some people not a spendthrift and i really have to think about my purchases and|user:the end of the year thing so i messed that up so i you know i'm still not in it's not a good habit to use it but fortunately i'm not uh	then i i'll use the Discover card	0
agent:uh-huh|user:was crawling under a desk hooking up a computer|agent:right	and i mashed it wrong or i did something	0

user:uh|user:than some other people too|user:you're more uh fluent in other things the things that you're interested in	i've been out of school for a long time	0

agent:yeah|user:and they lobby uh uh a lot in Congress|user:yeah uh gun control legislation is uh is really tough to beat i mean the NRA is so strong	so uh it's going to be really tough to uh add uh gun control type of laws	0
agent:well war just comes to mind [noise] you know couple a hundred people get get blown up and it's and it really shakes the country to it's roots maybe just because of the way it happens|agent:where um|agent:i don't know i guess this this this this Gulf War came to mind where	right	1
agent:[noise]|user:with guns i think it ought to be the same way|agent:hm yeah i didn't think about that i sort of thought that	i think people who own guns ought to be held responsible for things that happen with those weapons	1
user:so i don't know|user:ultimately|user:somebody's got to be held responsible	i think the law should be tightened up on on gun ownership but i can't see a total ban on it at all uh	0
user:ready|agent:okay uh what what what what exactly we're talking about uh industries trends everything	social changes	1
agent:uh i know my wife would [laughter] yeah but uh i don't know uh seems like we come uh a long ways in terms of [vocalized-noise] the economies of of things uh|user:um-hum um-hum|agent:compared to uh say some of the minority groups	yeah	1
agent:well|user:in the last because_1 i ca[n]- i can remember maybe before Nixon that uh|user:but uh what else what else has changed oh i guess uh Watergate was in there so i guess pol[itics]- politics in general has kind of kind of gone downhill	the presidents were really up on a pedestal	1
agent:yeah well i hope that's not right i do i do hear these statistics same as you do and uh and uh i- i- i always felt like at least the immediate family unit mother father and children|user:yeah it doesn't seem the norm to have uh have parents and and uh the two what two point five kids and all that uh|user:yeah	yeah	1
agent:they're a little hard to hide in that desert [laughter]|agent:[laughter]|user:it's it's it's easier to to fight i guess when you can find them [laughter] i remember that was the the problem back then you just couldn't find them	yeah i mean uh not not	1
agent:a nation that was industrially oriented towards uh manufacturing type industries|agent:but uh that i see as a change and then industrially going back uh i- i think uh uh industrially we've changed i think we've come through an era of the last thirty years or so twenty ten of a uh a|user:um-hum	yeah	0
agent:to what is the actual uh uh uh industrial evolutionary state of the country and by that i mean|agent:and uh i've said for years that the education system in this country has not reacted|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:a[t]- at least two of them we bought an Olds Calais and a Buick Skylark|agent:yeah [laughter] and four cars and we bought some year old cars from National Car Rental|user:oh goodness	really	1
agent:and uh we bought a uh we lived in the Philippines for TI in eighty five eighty six and eighty seven and we bought a uh Ford Telstar which is somewhat similar to the Taurus it's sold in the in uh the Far Eastern coun[tries]- Far East countries more then here|user:um-hum|agent:uh but i- i just loved that car	um-hum	0
agent:yeah yeah it seems that something goes every month and i'm afraid we're gonna be in that in another year with all of ours you know we got three eighty sixes and an eighty [laughter-four]|user:[noise] but once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them_1 [noise] all of them_1 you know [noise] it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for [laughter-them_1] [laughter]|agent:yeah	yeah e[xactly]-	1
agent:and uh uh i and you know we used to think Ford products were tinny i mean i was growing up i was taught that when i was growing up you know [laughter-that] [laughter-that] [laughter-that] real people bought General Motors products [laughter-and] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-and] peons bought Ford products but just with the quality requirements that Ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants and they're really|user:um-hum|agent:that the[se]- tho[se]- these companies have put into their procurement and it's [vocalized-noise] uh it's come about as a result of the competition from the Japanese	[laughter] that's right	1
agent:um-hum|user:are getting|agent:oh yeah yours is small [laughter]	oh around sixty thousand miles on them_1	0
user:um-hum|agent:yeah and uh uh you know you you figure out the options go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and and tell him what you want and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy a certain person at that dealer's place so i'm gonna try that the next time i buy one|user:really	i think that'd be a good idea	1
EMPTY	[noise]	0
agent:the uh|agent:you know compare the figures i could think that's where they're uh they're coming from|user:maybe they've changed their minds	maybe that's it maybe that's it because that was back in the seventies	1
agent:or uh uh j[ust]- just for the sake of argument i'm taking the|agent:well i don't either but uh uh but there is something to be said about|user:i i don't care to support them	sure	1
agent:uh|agent:yes very true i uh i agree with you there|user:it's easier to say it on the telephone and everyone agree that yeah the death penalty's the way to go it's a deterrent to crime they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway but to be the actual one of the ones that decide that would be tougher for me	i think i'd probably do it but we could never say what we would do if we're not in the circumstance it that's that's	0
user:hang them_1 [laughter-yeah] [laughter] yeah i agree it should be in effect also i agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement uh so i guess i would say i want it to be in effect but i want|user:[laughter]|agent:well anyhow i guess we both agree that that it is it should be in effect	maybe	0
user:oh okay is that how it's worded|agent:oh oh yes yes i i believe it's any capital crime related to drugs i think that's the way it's worded|user:and they they are in effect killing people	i knew it was there but i i or p[roposed]- or is it proposed or is it passed	1
agent:uh i wouldn't know but uh they i doubt very much that they're they're using it now in fact i'm sure they don't|agent:well i won't say they didn't try it|agent:they have not	well my children are about in the same age bracket i think let's see the oldest	0

user:send you a letter trying to get you to|user:you know will ask for a uh credit dump and then|agent:right	take their credit card	0
user:you know if you live in the Elton region or Great Falls area of Fairfax County or|agent:right|user:specific zip codes because of uh	or Montgomery County in Maryland	0

user:so uh i- i think everybody recommends that uh well they've they|user:and uh the information was erroneous|user:credit advance	the uh story this morning on the radio suggested you ought to do this about once a year	1
user:but uh it's just nice to make sure that no uh|agent:right|user:they're they're interested in keeping their records accurate	uh	0
user:he wasn't the|user:and he [laughter-had] a heck of a time convincing the authorities that|user:and he didn't have any children	the party that was responsible for failing to make child support payments [laughter]	1
user:probably the [laughter-national] [laughter-debt] [laughter-as] [laughter-a] matter of fact but the uh impossibility of|user:because of the uh|user:uh one of the biggest change in in uh the role of women in the last two generations is the fact that	of uh making ends meat even in a family that which has a two	0
user:uh|user:it has uh|user:right	has a lot of effect on a family and it can be positive and it can be very negative	0
user:that's the kind of uh|agent:um-hum|user:uh it just does not have the same kind of opportunities as the one who does	[noise]	0
agent:um-hum|user:that they're not worthy|user:they feel	and so	0
agent:um-hum um-hum|user:instead of giving you a break so that maybe a wife could stay home and do|agent:yeah	something satisfying in another area you know i- i think there are women who need to do things other than just	0
agent:um-hum|user:uh you know during lunchtime or whatever|user:so that they can their children can go there so that they can see them so that they can have this	some kind of a better uh contact and more uh a better feeling of of the fact that they are the important thing in this	0
agent:well i also think there's no longer sort of this predisposition that the woman has to be the caretaker and the upbringer for the children i think that's starting to dissipate|agent:right|user:uh at some other time that uh if you're better prepared you're going to be able to take advantage of those things maybe later or or maybe during sometimes	right	1
agent:[noise]|agent:bye|agent:you too	[noise]	1
agent:like a radio show just like the old days you know|agent:AM station or something had a um|agent:yeah just the other day i uh some	oh really	1
user:i know|agent:it's too bad|user:i know	and also um	0
user:yes|user:uh-huh|agent:because like uh i'm really glad that i'm in like uh the classes uh like honors classes and so it's like what's really good about that is that you meet people who really are interested in in talking about things and discussing world issues and it just and it makes me sick to go to school and	yes	1
agent:yeah it is|agent:uh-huh|user:uh just even being able to go to a movie when you want and and not relying on somebody else it's really pretty nice	[noise]	0

user:uh be really responsible and and do everything just like|agent:hum-um|user:yeah and i also think that in the future that uh it's gonna continue that we're not gonna see a lax off of women in the work force i think they're going to stay there and i think that they're gonna	what you said you know make make it the grade and and make it so women can be	0
agent:well it was good to talk to you|user:well great okay|agent:oh i do too definitely definitely	good to talk to you Sally	0
user:i think whenever like for the wedding we're doing this you know the wedding money we're doing together|user:and he allots so much to each thing and it works out good for him but|agent:uh-huh	and uh we've actually sat down and wrote out how much everything's going to cost and you know making sure we have enough for everything and	0
user:yeah|agent:to take over control of the of the financial situation for themselves if they have to|agent:and and then plus if there's ever any uh you know tragedy or anything in the family then both parties are prepared to	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:but uh you know it's money management's really an important thing you know with today's with the situation the way it is|user:yeah	uh-huh	0
agent:that's that's good every once in a while you find somebody on these conversations that you don't agree with everything have to bite your tongue but [laughter]|user:yeah [laughter]|agent:we seem to agree on everything [laughter]	uh-huh	1
user:good|user:very good|agent:we got our mo[ney]- got our money back	well wh[at]- do you think that uh consumer goods goods are generally getting better	0
user:i had taken the first one back i didn't think that it heated well enough it never did get [noise] anything but just moderately warm|agent:uh-huh|agent:no	took it back and [vocalized-noise] um	1
agent:[laughter]|user:now i figure th[at]- uh anybody that is dumb enough to iron|agent:oh	needs to have an iron that will last a long time	0
user:very personal information|agent:[laughter] but i think it should've been better than that for that money is what i mean|user:you're really divulging	oh of course i do too	1
user:um|user:uh-huh|user:[noise]	i think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system	0
agent:my wife teaches school here in Plano|user:yeah|agent:what to do about it i guess is the the big thing i'm i'm in a kind of an interesting situation in that my	uh-huh	1
agent:well ye[ah]- that would be that'd be at the absolute most and uh|agent:do that|user:yeah not not even that much probably	yeah	1
agent:a system or or something you know and then|agent:until you leave you're you're competing against somebody else or you're competing against uh|user:uh-huh	right	1
agent:yeah|user:and you know any other aspect of your life an but now now that he's in this program and|agent:yeah	you know he's i guess okay he's he's making straight A's	0
agent:take care of that sort of thing but|agent:somehow or rather there would be a program of some sort that would|agent:i guess today that would be uh	[laughter]	1
user:right|agent:you know uh just removed from those situations or they're never going to get anywhere but yet politically that is not a very popular|agent:you know and uh uh	um-hum	1
agent:yeah|agent:[laughter]|user:that we're you know dead smack dead in the center of and we have to try to swim out you know kind of like the Bermuda Triangle we're just sinking and it's almost impossible to swim back up	but um	0
user:and|agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum	you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out	0
user:people wouldn't want that i don't know i|user:and i'd give anything to have that right now in my in my regular li[fe]- i mean you you have everything given to you i don't see why|agent:yeah	but then if i was young i wouldn't see it	0
agent:right|user:and but i mean i really minor kinds of things you know like painting the painting the the smudge marks and uh|agent:uh-huh	uh	0
agent:uh-huh|user:three years ago|user:i we moved here f[rom]- uh from New England about uh	and uh we weren't quite prepared for the kinds of rains that uh you can get down here	0
agent:have not owned a home yet|agent:you know|user:oh yeah	yeah	1
user:the next house|agent:right|user:uh maybe in the new maybe in the new house [laughter]	uh	0
user:uh|user:that way uh uh|user:and uh	you know it's	0
user:uh|user:i never had uh my wife|agent:have you ever bought an old house or rented an old house and then fixed it up	parents did that they uh my wife's from New Hampshire	0
agent:[laughter] i've been sneezing all day so|agent:okay|user:self-contained apartment so uh and it was ni[ce]- nice i'm going to sneeze in a second [laughter] i'm going wonder how they're going to uh record that um	they uh [laughter]	1
user:yeah yeah i'm sure he'd i'm sure he'd love to|agent:you ought to have him come down for a visit when you get your new house|user:yeah of course he's he built the shelves in the in the garage for me [laughter] [laughter]	uh he he's getting a little impatient now because	0
user:so I was I mean we were just paying incredible|agent:um|user:and uh and New Hampshire at the time had the highest utility costs in the country	bills during the long cold Winters	0
agent:i live in Sherman now i'm from Indiana|user:so that was the trick where where where do you live|agent:huh	oh okay	1
agent:uh not even a year yet|user:how long did you say you've been married|user:yeah that's fun	oh	1
agent:i i couldn't get used to the fact that houses down in Texas don't have basements|user:[noise] excuse the buzzer|user:or actually got i i took the job out here and they moved me out here so uh	oh that was the that's the hardest thing	0
user:you know i travel back and forth which isn't too far it's only i only live about uh|user:and|agent:um-hum	about eight miles from the plant	0
user:you put those in a separate bundle and they have a special truck that comes around|user:a paper bag or or you tie them_1 up with string|user:you put those in there and they recycle those [noise] and then you put your newspapers in a separate or either you put them_1 in a	and they pick them_1 up curbside	1
user:uh it's all free just takes time and if you're retired and have nothing to do|agent:yeah|user:and i guess they can make of a you know it's like working a part-time job	um	1
agent:um-hum|user:used to be Brown University now it's uh University of Rhode Island|user:uh would	and what we learned down there is that uh [noise]	0
user:and they're not going out for chemicals they're not going out for a lot of fertilizers and stuff so they're letting it|agent:yeah|user:uh fertilizing which causes a lot of thatch and all that kind of stuff so there's more and more people too are aware of that up here	you know uh	1
agent:yeah|user:there could be the one up here some place i'm not really sure|user:yeah yeah	um	1
user:but the state|user:quite early because of the town fathers said yeah you know we think it's a good idea|user:uh we went on it	i think by nineteen ninety three every every town	1
agent:it's con[stantly]- either a matter of constantly touching up or maybe putting something more durable that i can wipe down and doesn't have to be painted all the time|agent:the basement being finished but you know with uh it's being used as a recreation center [noise] it's uh|agent:uh i'm contemplating actually uh doing a lot of wallpaper i think in the basement you know what having a problem of	right	1
user:yeah|agent:uh yeah trim yeah the aluminum doesn't need to be painted but yeah the trim and most people were doing it last year for the first time and that was five years|user:but that's just trim right	right	1
agent:uh well like i've gone back and i've painted after wallpaper has been put up around crown moldings and things like that and again the tape really comes in handy you just cover up anything you don't want paint to get on and paint and take it off and sometimes you can even reuse the tape it just peels off like those notepads type of thing|agent:and i've found that it can also be used|agent:it's a perfect clean line and	but this isn't masking tape	1
user:yeah|user:right|agent:and they're not as [noise] you don't get drips as well you can get drips you have to be a little careful but they hold quite a bit of paint so i found you're not constantly dipping like with a brush and uh it goes on very nice and evenly like sometimes with brushes you can sort of see streaks if you get it too thick and you don't have splatters like with a roller	right	1
agent:[laughter] yeah that's true uh so have you been happy with the painting that you've done or do you wish that you you had hired a professional or|user:right that's why i want to do the kitchen first i figure i can stand on the kitchen table [laughter]|user:[laughter]	[laughter]	1
agent:never|user:really have you served on a jury|agent:i mean you	i never have either but my friends my few friends who have uh say just the opposite [laughter]	0
agent:[laughter]|user:yeah i i was called once but i was out of the country and apparently i apparently they thought i served so i didn't i didn't make any noise about it [laughter]|agent:i've i've never [noise] i've never even been called to jury duty	i came back and they said the record showed i served but i was out of the country at the time so i'm pretty sure i didn't	1
user:from what i hear i i have i have some friends who do expert [wist/witness] witness testimony|user:juries are extremely uh and|user:and you also get a lot of um	and they say that uh juries are extremely vulnerable to uh sort of emotional pitches you know the prosecutor will want to uh [noise] oh i don't know show the show the mugging victim you know show what the nice person he was and what a family life and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim	0
user:oh of course it's it's political maneuvering the the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will you know|agent:you know because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want|agent:and uh or they fool the the defense in thinking that they're	want to hang everyone and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic they're not looking for someone whose going to be the most reasoned	0
agent:it was nice talking to you|user:[laughter] okay well it was nice talking with you|agent:[laughter]	bye-bye	1
agent:uh-huh|user:well interesting enough we're going to we're going to do it over an eight day period|agent:are you going to do it over a weekend or	uh they will not	0
agent:uh-huh|user:but uh it's it's it's uh it requires a lot of uh logistics for food for the people who will have to meet|user:uh so it's kind of once more combining the whole group again	and a lot of uh arranging for activities	0
user:oh just uh general kinds of things like uh swimming and|user:and then there will be uh|user:a pretty good size area where there'll be hiking and	whatever during the uh in the area roundabout which they will do during the days when they want to	0
agent:uh-huh|user:we only did it for one day|user:and uh	and uh the last time we d[oing]- we were doing it every two years and we decided last time we would wait	0
user:now i've never gotten all my family to come before but this year i have uh several married daughters and|user:uh so that maybe they'd be attracted more to bring their families|agent:um-hum	and sons whose families are	0
user:but it just there just more of them there still than there are other places the rest of us are kind of strung around some but we['re]- but you know if you|user:and so uh at that point we were going for that reason we were going there|agent:uh-huh	if you're talking about convenient for the biggest majority it still is there	1
user:will rent out uh|agent:how|user:so we might do something like that also sometimes universities will	areas	0
agent:okay|user:if not exactly at least know generally what they're going to do|agent:right	well it's kind of important to to know quite a while ahead of time	0
user:[laughter] yeah we're kind of like we kind of uh|user:but|agent:wow sounds like you guys are uh your family's really into family	well we like each other and we liked our families and so we figure they the little kids ought to get to know each other and	0
user:was it is it|agent:it too it's it was a large transition let me tell you because_1 they had to meet one person they only had to meet me and i had to probably meet twenty five or thirty people|user:do you do you enjoy your do you enjoy your your wife's large family though	yeah	1
agent:that are our age and you know so we get|agent:but uh Carla has a lot of cousins|user:yeah yeah	yeah	0
agent:a a Ford Explorer|user:i'm sorry what|agent:a Ford Explorer	oh really	1
agent:oh|user:oh i don't know they're they're not as nice looking|agent:what's wrong with the Volvo	oh [laughter] uh meant to me i don't know i'm sure there are some that are but	0
user:my actual favorite cars -[i]s were uh like the Ford|user:i like|user:i don't know	Thunderbirds	0
agent:and uh so you're what are your feelings about American versus European cars|user:uh-huh|agent:i mean you're sitting up on top of everything and you can really see real well and i just it's it's so comfortable and	um	1
agent:that's the way it goes i guess|user:[noise] i don't know|user:uh Cougar and he's never had any problem with it either so	[laughter]	0
agent:but uh anyway that's my own personal comment i guess bu[t]-|user:[laughter]|agent:they're still concerned about my attitude and it it will never change about that place and uh	yeah this girl that works for me just bought a car down there and sh[e]- they	0
agent:that was i was asking you some questions about the telephone and how long and how many have you been doing but that's they they don't want to hear that bu[t]-|user:what|agent:so ha[ve]- have you been using well anyway	oh jus[t]-	0
agent:i think so and uh we have uh|user:hm depends_1 on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion i take|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
user:uh frankly i think that uh|agent:um-hum|user:that uh there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles but it's mostly from older automobiles i don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting	i think that um	1
agent:um-hum|user:so that i think would be a tremendous help and i happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical and it just keeps getting uh gives me good service and i don't have an incentive to get rid of it long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money|user:okay	on the other hand i know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars i have	0
user:and uh uh|user:and uh|user:and	people uh	0
agent:hum|user:i just don't know exactly what it necessarily is but i just can't believe this|user:and i can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution	now we have a lot of pollution being caused by chlorof[luorocarbons]- uh fluorocarbons	0
agent:um-hum well that's good|user:no they they they m[ade]- passed a law and made them_1 take fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers|agent:but it doesn't have anything that's damaging	and that was a move in the right direction we are doing some things to try to correct the problem	0
agent:well we need to do something we need to get serious about it|user:they'll fine you fifty bucks i think the first time and two fifty the second time|agent:is that right	yeah you right you got to give people incentives and surprisingly enough just handling of trash	0
user:trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air|user:and uh that can help to cut pollution i guess some i- i don't know how much|agent:um-hum	i would hope that they would help some though	0
user:uh esp[ecially]- particularly on industry|user:and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said somebody happened to stay up late night or something i don't think we have a adequate policing|user:that uh that i think may go on a lot	uh we have good policing at least in this state and and uh several of the surrounding states and probably yours too of car pollutants because we have to go down uh once a year here in Maryland and get our car's exhaust systems checked for emissions	0
user:uh a sister state to to this|user:i think it's a good idea the emissions check though is required in Maryland and it's also required in Virginia|user:and i think that's a good idea too not no[t]- not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution n[ecessarily]- necessarily but	and that's that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants	1
agent:um-hum|user:i've worried uh especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like|user:but water pollution uh	i know a lot more people are going to bottled water	1
user:uh-huh|agent:spring and it was like ice cold spring water and i guess parts of the the city still ha[ve]- you know get that but|user:yeah	huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:to uh Peru several times i've never made it to|user:in fact i think a lot of the i've been	other parts of South America but uh i have been to Peru	1
user:Latin Americans come down from the hills you can't imagine what poor is and uh the worst scene i've ever had i think was uh [noise]|agent:um-hum|user:native	someone eating out of out of a garbage can on the streets in Lima Peru	1
user:and he said come i'll show you and he walked out in the backyard and|user:expensive uh holdings and all that and the ambassador said but i know what you make as a US senator how can you afford all of this|user:home was palatial an[d]- they had five or six servants you know and and a lot of	the uh senator said do you see that hospital over there and the ambassador said yes and he	0
user:so [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-it] it's a sad story but|agent:yep [laughter] intentions intentions [laughter]|user:and the ambassador [potted/patted] patted his pocket and said one hundred percent	yes yes but it uh it is a problem	1
agent:yes oh the stories she tells you know are just|user:for such such a problem|user:the unpreparedness	and yet they're so	1
user:you're|agent:they don't want it i mean [laughter-that's] [laughter-kind] [laughter-of] [laughter-a]|agent:they want it but	e[xactly]- you're exactly right um-hum	0
agent:that that's the way to bring us to our knees more on their [laughter-level] you know that's really uh kind of a far fetched idea i know and i don't think people probably say or think those things consciously but|user:um-hum|agent:you know they they know that by pumping that poison into our system	you know	1
user:elsewhere in Latin America|user:the grower in Columbia and|user:which would still give the uh	the uh the money that they apparently need and go go to the illegal crop for	1
agent:[noise]	[noise]	0
user:but it's the cases you know like sometimes you you know you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely you know they really didn't do it well you know|agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh	you you got you got that	0
user:exactly|user:uh-huh|agent:any reason i don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it [noise]	uh i'm not sure about Pennsylvania whether we have it or not for some reason i was thinking that we do but it's you know it's not very often i think	0
agent:but they have such a crime problem because they have such a un[employment]- unemployment rate [noise] you get that unemployment way up so then people you know tend towards crime and then they [noise] they start stiffening the penalties|user:yeah|user:uh-huh	uh you know	1
user:i don't i don't|agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh	uh i- i don't i think that it should be i mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone a murder then i think you know that they should likewise	0
agent:and so uh|user:[laughter]|agent:but some of these guys just don't care you know	i think some of them would rather be in jail [laughter]	1
user:see yeah okay well see i'm i'm in kind i'm|agent:more urban i mean less|agent:the the more	in kind okay uh we only have	1
agent:Sharon Pennsylvania's up there|user:it might have a new name|agent:very old uh historical place there	yeah	0
agent:yeah well i'm just saying that that that's what|user:yeah but you know i look at that and say well they should have thought about that beforehand|agent:because they know that the judge you know if they find them guilty is you know has the the opportunity to sentence them you know for for the death sentence	you know	1
agent:similar to what we would have in our own homes as as parents|agent:something similar so that she would be raised in an environment that would be|agent:if i was close to home relatives or people with the same values and possibly religious faith or	and what religious faith	1
agent:uh|agent:kind of uh eliminate a lot of the|agent:right by trying to get them to conform to concern standards they uh	better situations	1
agent:yeah i like that situation that's usually real good [laughter]|user:most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma|user:and	but	1
user:and they would read and play|user:in her home|agent:uh-huh	seem to be	1
agent:several hours a day bases you have to be licensed|agent:but in Virginia i think if you take more than three children in on more than a|agent:well that was how it was this Virginia we've recently moved here to Texas	i	1
user:by and large certain standards for|user:meets|user:child care	uh	1
user:number of|user:of of working adults for|user:number	children	1
user:charismatic|user:i really believe that this|user:yet	care	1
agent:not a real educated program you can have good educational program and and|agent:you know even if it's|agent:yeah a little bit of love and and attention is what most of them need	and not have any care	1
user:uh yeah uh|agent:and -[u]sually that's done through example not you know an actual sit down learn situation so|agent:promote politeness and niceness you know the things that you would want any child to learn	it's a very broad issue	1
user:and and that's really a a shame too because|agent:i know i i did that for summer so i can i can vouch for [laughter-that]|agent:yeah	do you and your husband both work	1
user:we're being forced into a situation we as Americans are being forced into a situation|user:more and more|user:but	where	1
user:[laughter]|agent:well we vacation a lot how about you [laughter] quite frequently [laughter]|user:so	uh i wish we did [laughter]	1
user:and so we've been out there a couple of times and um|agent:uh-huh|user:seems like i do a lot in the Midwest lately um my um [noise] my fiancee's family's from Wisconsin	i uh i went to Purdue for a couple of years so i've gone up to Indianapolis on occasion to visit friends	0
user:not that much we've gone out to um|agent:ever go up in Pennsylvania in the mountains or|user:and um	uh a place in western Pennsylvania called Falling Water	0
agent:but it's a pretty neat town to just go and walk around if you like to walk it's a good town to just walk in|agent:yeah|user:yeah i've heard uh i'm not real interested in Williamsburg because of the of the price attached to it we just we i	hum	1
user:yeah i was um we use it live in California and um my um up up around San Francisco and um|user:um-hum|agent:we've done it a couple of times and that's enough for us [laughter] probably another twenty years [laughter]	there was one year when my father was uh my father's company was starting t[o]- to do stuff down in Los Angeles	0
agent:have you ever you've never been down to Epcot at Florida and Disney|agent:[laughter]|user:um there was nobody there when we were there we got we won a log floating ride like five straight times we just get get done with them and they go oh do you want to go again and we'd say sure [laughter]	[noise] no i'd like to sometime but	1
agent:uh-huh sounds good|agent:uh-huh|user:we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun she um she had this uh book of pictures from it that were really nice kind of like a travel guide	so um that that should be a lot of fun	1
agent:[laughter] well we spent last week end in Charlotte with real good friends that had just moved to back East from|agent:is that right [laughter]|user:um it was fun i actually yesterday i ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab i'm in [laughter]	ooh	1
agent:uh-huh yeah it's real pretty|user:we keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the summer and it's never really works [laughter-out]|user:yeah um	yeah	1
agent:just walking that's all [laughter]|user:except our outside [vocalized-noise] though|agent:not too much into sports	[laughter]	1
user:yeah um|agent:[vocalized-noise]|agent:Buccaneers oh okay	yeah i maybe seeing them um	0
agent:i'm against it|user:[laughter] uh where do you stand on gun control|user:okay	ag[ain]- your a one then	1
agent:that they keep wanting to pass gun control laws that do nothing but take away your your constitutional amendments|agent:i agree one hundred percent i just uh what irritates me i guess is|user:you know and so	uh-huh	1
agent:whether you want guns drugs women anything|user:uh-huh|agent:i mean you know and	uh-huh	0
user:i don't want anyone to have a gun that could harm me|user:i want to protect myself but at the same time|user:i mean it it	you know what i'm saying	0
agent:no longer carry guns to defend themselves because on[ly]- only the criminals are|agent:it's just that all the honest people you know the citizens as it were|user:trouble yeah	but do you think more and more people now are carrying guns and weapons	0
agent:you're single i take it|user:uh if i'm going anywhere at night anywhere i mean if i'm just stepping outside my door i carry something on me if i'm you know going up to my door and i don't have anything i put my keys in some kind of weapon like position in my hand|user:right now i have a knife under the seat in my car	you know	0
agent:uh it's because of guns no it's not because of the guns it's because of the people and and actually they're breaking in|user:uh-huh|user:yeah	no no	0
agent:as you know uh John Lennon was you know you know was shot and killed|user:really um-hum|agent:oh yeah but you know where where are the most crimes committed New York state	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|user:yeah|agent:yeah they're people doing that so i mean the the solution is not to pass more laws than you can't enforce because they're they're going to pass one now they're trying too either the Staggers Bill or the Brady Bill	um-hum	1
agent:nobody pays attention to a baseball bat|user:uh|agent:oh yeah it's uh it's quite a deal	uh-huh	1
agent:but you know the to my way of thinking you know uh i'm a i'm you know i put blood on the ground you know [vocalized-noise] the United States|user:a lot of sense|agent:makes about as much sense	uh	1
agent:it's a yellow form|user:do you okay|user:you know	uh-huh	1
agent:no i don't have any children|user:and do you have small children|agent:uh yes i do full time	oh okay	1
user:and so i- i haven't|agent:right|user:i i'm not in a field that is typically a man's field i'm not a surgeon i'm not a doctor um	um [noise] oh	0
agent:you know builds my confidence quite a bit|agent:and present yourself professionally and|agent:she you know builds me up and says be a strong woman and	um-hum	1
user:and i|agent:right|user:somewhere between a nurse and a doctor	um i frequently see patients without the doctor seeing them	0
agent:uh-huh|user:you know that sort of thing but their culture is still very much though|agent:uh-huh	not a woman's thing	0
agent:oh yeah that's what they were saying before they had children they were working like crazy people|user:seventy hour weeks again|agent:in other words if you wouldn't of had	i mean i don't i	1
user:but|user:i- i you know it's it's i mean i love what i do|agent:yeah	i love my children so much more	0
user:di[scussed]- discussed with them or what|user:of of what's not being uh you know uh|user:i'm afraid of what	or what opportunities are missed	1
agent:yeah|user:you know doing Bible study or|user:[noise] um	prayer group or whatever you are	0
agent:i need to go to day care [laughter]|user:it's incredible|agent:from this seventy hour work person to somebody that goes God i'm ready get out of here you know	it's	1
agent:yeah|user:but they didn't call that a drug test so tha[t]- i think they checked for drugs they just don't [noise] tell you they did|user:on me	[noise]	1
agent:that's true|user:um and th[e]- the only way that they can prevent that is is you know making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free|agent:right	and you know the the problem in the work place is that that people are	0
user:yeah|agent:i guess that's kind of biased|agent:so	well and it's i i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job	0
user:yeah and then you're|agent:yeah i guess so i guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the [laughter-consequences]|user:well yeah i guess it comes with the turf	i[n]- i[n]- in terms of	1
user:to go|user:o[pportunity]- opportunity|agent:yeah	get your life straight rather than to lose your job	1
user:[laughter] [laughter-it] happens a lot|agent:yeah i know i ca[n't]- it's hard to believe but i guess it does [laughter]|user:well that happens	there there are people that	0
agent:how weird i didn't know [noise] that|user:back a certain period of time|user:um	um because um some of the the residue ends up in your hair follicles you know it's kind of	1

agent:let them_1 out and take them_1 for walks and|agent:if you if you raise them_1 right you know you don't have to worry about the litter box thing where with dogs you really do have to|user:yeah that's true	take them_1 for walks right	1

user:of course it's a little further south in South America but there's an outbreak of uh|user:and so that that that kind of thing concerns me um it's the things that we're not doing that we should be doing like right now there's a big outbreak of uh|agent:yeah	uh what is it cholera	0
user:and|agent:right|user:right now we're starting we're starting to talk about having free trade with Mexico	my God this is something we should have done years ago and Mexico is our closest neighbor they've been in financial trouble for years	0
agent:in their ability to to develop industrially uh as well as even very well agriculturally|agent:uh seem to always lack|agent:preponderance of countries in the middle latitude zones that uh	yeah	0
agent:that's right or or unless they're kicking the British's [laughter-butts] like they did in the Falkland Islands something like that where it involves one of our allies|user:or unless we're sending thousands of troops down there to kick somebody's butt i mean|agent:yeah unless they have a coffee strike or the drug problem gets out of uh proportion like it did for awhile	[laughter-yeah]	1
user:i- i|user:um so it's it's like really strange that we never pay that much attention|agent:um-hum um-hum	you know i just find myself lacking in in a lot of knowledge about South America [vocalized-noise]	0
user:oh uh-huh|user:[laughter-okay]|agent:okay well i can go ahead and start and tell you mine um we're from San Antonio and that's where i grew up so i was used to the heat and out here right now um gosh it gets to about seventies high seventies and it gets very cold at night	uh-huh	1

user:yeah|agent:yeah San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come it's compl[ete]- it's a complete mess everything floods all the under passes so i didn't realize that Dallas had that same problem|agent:um-hum	yeah we have it es[pecially]- especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years there's a	1
agent:summer spring [laughter] and uh to come here it's kind of the the temperate|agent:essentially like you said yeah you have the cold winter and then you have the hot|user:uh-hum	um-hum	1

agent:oh i imagine that Virginia i imagine gets really humid doesn't it|user:yeah my wife's originally from Virginia and we lived there for about nine months and that was a real change for me|agent:and uh so it's been good	um parts do we uh we were over in th[e]- in the western edge in the mountains	1
agent:okay well i sure appreciate hearing how things are going in Texas and uh|user:i think that'll do it [laughter]|agent:well you think that takes care of the the time and	well i enjoyed talking with you Lisa	1
agent:i'm not for sure we know exactly what what all happened in that situation so uh|agent:and so it seems like there's you know always somebody digging things like that but|user:um-hum	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:it needs to be uh taught from the earliest grades|agent:and cultural diversity is just something we really don't understand and it's uh|agent:not very much uh i[n]- in our colleges we're trying we're i happen to teach at college with tremendous number of international students and	um-hum	1
agent:the same thing they uh they haven't been waiting quite as long even though they've been waiting since forty eight|agent:well that's|agent:and that	right	1
user:right|agent:such a volatile uh area i mean there's just no stability there period that's what's|agent:uh but i[t's]- it's just such a	but but in a sense i don't know that i- i that i would say it's good but in	0
agent:or Syria or I[srael]- or uh Baghdad i would love to go there|agent:i that's one part of the world i've i've been to north Africa a lot but not um i haven't been to Beirut or|agent:right	yeah i was never able to go to Baghdad it was i never could get a visa	0

user:um i've always been interested in older homes personally|user:but uh it's pretty typical for the area as well|user:and um i live in the basic three bedroom two bath home so at least i have two bathrooms that's not so bad	so it's i think you can end up you can end up doing more with them it seems like	1
agent:development communities that they've put together the houses are so close together if your neighbors having an argument you can hear it blow for blow|agent:newer neighborhoods|agent:well in the um	yeah	1
agent:it helps a bunch|user:at least we do have uh like three walk-in closets here so that's that's maybe not so so typical but uh|user:yeah that's really it that's a plus	yeah it really does except when you you know have to fill them_1 up and then you get those Visa bills in and [laughter]	0
agent:well that's|user:but you know too the only bad thing about that is then you have to keep up you know you have|user:that's nice that is nice	the yard to deal with and	1
user:yeah that's that's nice|agent:yeah this entire neighborhood everybody keeps the places up real nice|user:are you working on it i mean do do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation	yeah the the town that i came from is uh is a uh older town and it's like the typical the typical homes there are like you know early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds	0

user:so it won't make you sick|user:i guess it works but um you have to really wash your vegetables after that|user:you know i've heard him talk about that forever	let's see what else do you do to your house	1
agent:the only thing that saves it with the schedule i work and the schedule my wife works we're getting ready to go to work at di[fferent]- totally different times|user:even just with two people that was a pain|user:and that was	that's good	1
user:[laughter]|user:yeah|agent:uh he he likes to dig around a little bit then his mother comes in and says h[ow]- why did you let him play in the dirt like i said he was enjoying himself	that's right it's healthy why not	0

user:and they do take up a big part of my|agent:uh-huh|user:uh i have a total of five children i have three left living at home	uh my evening and weekend	1
agent:right|user:and then uh the you you can use what ever rationale you want but basically the healthier you stay the longer you'll live|agent:uh-huh	and uh you know if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer well then i'll be around a lot longer	0
agent:man|agent:um-hum|user:twenty there were n[ot]- very few heart attacks there were none prior to nineteen hundred well in nineteen oh three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water and then after that	we started having the hearts attacks	0
agent:yeah|user:and uh proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis which is the clogging of the|agent:uh-huh	arteries and uh	0
agent:neurosurgeon so he's really interested in the heart|user:yeah|agent:i'll have to remember that that'd be really interesting my husband wants to go into med school and be a	yeah	1
agent:high risk factors and heart disease and all that|agent:that's a real good um he talks about that talks about|user:um-hum	yeah i actually	0
agent:huh|user:[laughter]|agent:yeah	but uh we've uh i work at the TI site in Hunt Valley Maryland	0
user:right|agent:um apparently it's getting worse i mean i can tell that just by driving in Dallas you have the low f[lying]- flying gray cloud on certain days but|user:uh-huh	[noise]	1
user:dumping chemicals et cetera and all that|user:and|user:and they just don't want to sink the money into it unless someone clamps down on them_1 makes them_1 do it	you know they're just looking for the easy way out which you know i guess	1
user:that when we|user:you know they besides sinking their own time into it is|user:stops a lot of people from getting involved in the environmental issues	police these companies you know they say well look we're having to pay two million to put this filter device on it you're going to pay an extra	0
user:you know they just|user:i'm going to work on doing that a little bit more to people that|user:so you know i'll	aren't	0
user:um i guess we could talk about smoking because_1 it is a form of air pollution|user:it just seems though|agent:gosh	and uh	1
user:for a coronary artery disease when i was younger|user:than what the smoker gets through the filter you know what affect that had on me|agent:just as yeah	but	0
agent:sort of thing and and they respect that or else they just don't come back they don't smoke in my car|user:yeah|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:well yeah|user:and he's kn[ow]- you know they've told him for years to quit smoking and he still smokes you know|user:i had an uncle that had quadruple bypass surgery and was near death many times	you know some people are just	1
user:yeah it's you know maybe there'll be six inches on the ground at one time|agent:really|user:but the last few years we've barely gotten any snow at all	and it'll blow for a while and then it'll all melt away it's just like	0
agent:where uh they pick up newspapers in their is they're part of the regular garbage pickup|user:um-hum|agent:uh Richardson has uh started recently a newspaper recycling program	um-hum um-hum	1
user:it's|user:um|agent:right	um	1
user:um so that seemed to have been working quite well|user:but uh that sure made it easy i mean there was like no excuse not to recycle you just need two trash cans and if it's recyclable you throw it in one and if it's not you throw it in the other and take both out|agent:right	um	0
user:you know [vocalized-noise] with with min[imal]- minimal taxation for reple[nishing]- re[plenishing]- replenishing the land after the mine is gone or|user:um without any charge for you know long-term effects on the land or|user:things like aluminum only cost what it costs the company to produce them	health costs or all sorts of things like that or for that matter anytime you take aluminum out of the ground	0
agent:uh i'm finding i'm i'm almost offended when i go into a restaurant now and they try to give me a styrofoam cup for coffee or something you know|user:yeah|agent:to really concentrate a lot more on on limiting tho[se]- the use of those	uh uh-huh	1
agent:uh not the plastic bottles i guess is the main thing|agent:i guess that's a a good idea i do i would like to see uh we talk about buying the larger containers i'd like to see those larger containers not the|agent:right yeah	well it's funny because_1 plastic is incredibly recyclable	0
user:um-hum um-hum|agent:we're uh my wife and i are are looking at you know designing a new house now and uh probably you know some years away before we'll be ready to build it but|agent:yeah	um-hum	1
agent:oh absolutely|user:do you have any strong opinions on that|agent:yes	uh what are yours	1
agent:yep|user:uh-huh i think that would've been a much smarter way to handle it and the another thing that would've helped a lot would be to make certain that [noise] the people who were going to use the money that we were providing|user:that	should've had there own at stake	0
user:well uh i don't know what could've been done other than the uh insurance regulation but i certainly think that was a mistake and the um|agent:right|user:yes they don't they don't lose anything	i also think it was a mistake to reimburse all depositors over a hundred thousand dollars when they were told up-front that that was was	0
agent:i mean if you invest in stocks or whatever you know it's it's not just the responsibility of the broker it's your responsibility you know to know what you're investing in and the kinds of risks you're taking and it seems to me if you're going to put more than a hundred thousand dollars or whatever the limit's going to be in a bank that you should be aware i mean it's one thing to have insurance when you're protecting the little guy who doesn't have the time to make or the|agent:um-hum|user:uh service to people	absolutely	1
agent:uh yes i mean there's got to be long long term consequences over this you know just because|user:um-hum [noise] well uh do you think that we're heading for another uh debacle of this sort in the uh insurance industry|agent:and that's fair enough	and we see	1
agent:um-hum|user:and the the state governor is saying that we're going to protect those people but how are we going to do that|agent:hm	where the state itself is already in hock uh we're running thirteen million dollars no billion sorry thirteen billion dollars in the hole for	0
agent:i think so too|agent:yep|agent:yeah it's been good	thanks for talking	0
agent:uh-huh|user:is sort a um is prob[ably]- l[iberalism]- [vocalized-noise] is a is a hub of liberalism [laughter] you know compared to the country uh you know very um|user:yeah well being i[n]- in in Baltimore see Maryland is um	in in many ways uh very liberal very similar to New England though Pennsylvania and New York uh i [vocalized-noise] aren't actually as liberal Maryland is a very liberal uh	0
user:hm|agent:but they uh [noise] quickly did away with it|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:well i'll tell you|agent:about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag|user:sure	i i think you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag	1
user:they should be allowed|user:is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then|user:i think uh you know but i i still what the stan[ds]- flag stands for i guess to me	uh	1
user:yeah|user:uh i think that's what's made democracy|agent:uh yeah but here again i go back to the second amendment you can disagree by s[peech]- freedom of speech	um-hum yeah	1
agent:um-hum|user:and i would never do it i i love this country too much and that symbol means a lot to me|agent:no	um	0
agent:uh carried a weapon or killed for his country|agent:uh uh a a black eye to every man that ever [noise]|agent:and to me that's	i agree there too i agree with you there too i i the um	0
agent:um-hum|user:but they would vote pro-choice|user:um even you know for instance the pro-life pro-choice movement uh you know i don't know anybody that actually supports abortion	because you know	0
user:sometimes i guess|user:no no i think the um|agent:well tell me has it ever been decided when when is a uh fetus a human	what did i read recently the um the the uh Christian	1
user:uh i think that uh|agent:um-hum|user:yeah and how yeah how it'll sway from one e[xtreme]- one extreme to another	you know i i just read something i think in Time magazine uh ab[out]- about um	1
agent:i uh i'm originally from the east and i we used to wear sweaters and things and sweaters are|agent:yeah|user:i mean poly[ester]- especially in this climate polyester just doesn't work too well	uh-huh	1
agent:whether that affects how you dress i can imagine uh|user:i haven't heard that|agent:know when you have to go out or go to lunch or whatever it's to to walk or however and get to a place that is uh you don't have to go in and out of the of the temperature	the last thing i heard about fashion i think i mentioned it yesterday was that wide ties were coming back	1
user:yeah|agent:public schools oh i didn't hear that yet|user:well i just read something in fact i think it was today about how the public a lot of private or a lot of the public schools now are going to uniforms	because uh they feel like there's too much competition in the clothing	0
agent:go through a lot of shirts and think no i don't really|agent:uh|agent:no i really don't it's uh	you know i think and and this may be totally unfair and unfounded but it seems to me like	0
user:well at the my i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago|user:[noise]|user:tell me how yours work	when i said that we are uh	0
agent:that throws the budget out of whack real fast|user:[laughter] so you see|agent:oh no	well we actually	0
user:lessened it uh our living expenses uh more than|user:and we really uh|agent:yeah	what we thought we would [vocalized-noise]	1
agent:[noise] uh i don't know we've we've tried different times we've done like a survey of like taking you know the past three months of where all the money went|agent:and um we just really have uh|agent:and we um have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids	um-hum	1
agent:and uh|agent:you know a lot of things like that that really i[s]- are hard to plan for|user:yes	well i really do i think you have to budget those things though	1
agent:[noise]|agent:[laughter] oh boy [laughter] bye|user:oh i know uh we'll have to stay home and mow the yard [laughter] bye-bye	[noise]	1
agent:okay i know it|user:an an P S E|agent:how about you do you have um a mach[ine]-	and	0
user:through put is much faster on mine than than those but i think it's just because of the|user:yeah [laughter] i'd i've noticed uh there was some scattered at work and i notice the uh|agent:possible exception of the fact that it's got a mouse port built in the back	the lower level in expectation out of them that the processing speed is much faster	1
agent:for the school to do you know for all the kids in the school to do word processing on and|agent:they brought a bunch of Macs into uh there must have been some sort of program and they brought Macintoshes in for us to|user:uh-huh	right	0
agent:to be able to have things at home and and to study the interaction too has been wonderful|agent:on on on a on a lot of mainframe machines so yeah this is been a lot of expanding and having|user:uh-huh	yeah it's interesting i think uh i've i've worked with computers since nineteen	1
agent:i mean the the the notion of personal computer back then meant you had to have your own living room|user:oh it's been amazing it really has been|agent:God so you've really watched the whole the whole field grow up	oh i know it i know it and	0
user:so|user:PS two|agent:okay	i have	1
user:well|user:oh it it was almost uh|agent:um the big you know the the ones that that that took up a whole room in the sixties i mean how would you you know power wise was that less well actually less powerful than	it's hard to describe	0
user:put it into one of the accumulators|user:and you had to know exactly in memory where it was move it to the distributor|agent:oh God okay	and add it take it back out of the distributor and put it somewhere else so it it was as basic as you can get	1
agent:my uh my my sister-in-law is a principal of a school|user:yeah|agent:going to say there's a big move for that	uh-huh	1
EMPTY	i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i- i make a fair amount of money and uh the taxes that i pay um i guess as a	0
agent:yeah|agent:uh-huh|user:uh regardless of the outcome of the Desert Storm uh Desert Shield uh situations	uh i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the mi[litary]- military off and on over the over the years of being called back and things of that nature is uh i've found that you know there's an extraordinary amount of waste i take that as a	0
user:the Soviet threat i guess was perceived as being|user:that would be to keep it at a level those levels i guess that that were originally appropriated w[as]- was when|user:yeah but it it it it would that be uh well let's see two thousand out of eleven thousand that's about a little over twenty per cent uh i- i should imagine that	a greater one i don't think there's very much of a threat there today	0
user:now the and and it's it's a cliche i- i but i see it myself i see where|user:uh in the area of defense or perhaps we have paid too much there i don't know it just seems to me that over the years|user:yeah well i- i- i'm what i'm uh i guess uh it concerned about talking about the taxes in general and that that was an area that i- i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for	the infrastructure is sort of breaking down the roads the highways	0
agent:and now even the money that's been raised for the local districts is being is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state|agent:complete it's all shifted to local districts|agent:oh complete	because i guess they can't raise that money in those those poorer districts huh	1
user:that that|user:and i- i don't really care what it takes to qualify whether you're uh an an [vocalized-noise] [laughter-whether] [laughter-you're] [laughter-a] [laughter-veteran] or whether you i don't even know if you have to perform community service or unless uh or or you promise to even do something in the future i think that uh the|agent:that's right	the subsidy itself or i guess the enactment of that form of legislation	0
user:they must charge fees uh i- i i'm not too sure of that|user:the states now establish uh don't have enough money so they|agent:uh-huh	reasoning	0
agent:yeah i really do|user:you really think so|agent:more say	but i mean w[hat]- what's what's happened here is is is i feel that that in the last ten years	0
agent:[noise]|user:[noise] okay	uh we're going to talk about our lawn and gard[en]- garden chores do you have either one	1
user:[laughter]|agent:oh absolutely [laughter]|user:or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight	well i unfortunately am not gardening this year i love gardening in fact	0
user:well and actually i think that most women's garden clubs that i've been aware of in the past|agent:sort of format but i know people who do it and and enjoy it very much|user:yes	uh are only flowers what i would li[ke]- we've spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma just moved to	0
user:until the last couple when uh|agent:yes|user:[laughter] it was nice it was exhilarating uh for many years uh many of those ten	we had such an economic slowdown	0
user:yeah|user:okay|agent:well you know why because i grew up in North Carolina and that was my mother's um favorite bean she alw[ays]- she always grows you know five different varieties but that's the kind that produces the best	yeah well i think it has the best flavor	1
agent:oh yes oh yes oh it is it's great it's it's really her joy and i g[uess]- suppose that's why i enjoy gardening because you know growing up with it we also grow um|user:and she tends to it herself|agent:and i have four children you know so	uh-huh isn't that wonderful	1
agent:very uh happy about the new way of controlling the the uh worm that gets in broccoli um B[acillus]- by using the Bacillus thuringiansis which is the uh little well in fact that's what they use for gypsy moth i don't know if you have had that problem there or not but it's you know it's a problem that's that's moving south from from the New England area and they devastate the trees so they they spray the the government uh sprays|agent:and i have been|user:oh	no	1
agent:and they actually had typed little letters requesting you know catalogs and what not and figure up mileage expenses and|agent:and i think she did four|user:that's probably a good idea	all kinds of little	1
agent:you know part of college is being far enough way that you can't come home and do you laundry and come home for all football games and|agent:if you|agent:and kind of the premise being that um	yeah	1
user:i guess probably one of the things that that i've i've learned is that|user:i know like|user:but uh	to try and pick a college where they have	0
agent:but there was just that little piece of me you know going back to my own experience of oh gosh you know if my kids go there i'll never get rid of [laughter-them] [laughter] i mean they'll never going to be on their own how long am i gonna you know have kids in my house staying up till|agent:i've been really [laughter] impressed|agent:uh programs through it and as a family we've you know been involved with some of the arts things and you know that it's provided	yeah	1

agent:so he started the first grade when he was five or started yeah first grade when he was five years old|user:oh|user:um-hum	uh-huh	1
agent:okay|user:um-hum if i had any children i would uh|agent:it costs us more for her to stay home more than it does for him to go to the babysitter so	i hope that i'll be in a position to stay home with my child because	1
agent:so through other folks where we worked we found a nice preschool it was actually at a licensed preschool you know we had those requirements|user:uh-huh|agent:folks where i where i work i work at TI	um-hum	1
agent:so you have no children at all huh|agent:yeah|user:in [laughter-class] with your child just to see how it is or something	but	1
user:uh-huh|user:um-hum um-hum|agent:but [laughter-anyway] it's tough it really is it's hard to find good child care and it's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he's going to be fine all day long	um-hum	1
agent:you know but his|agent:tall for a six year old and|user:um-hum	did you take this same uh route with your other two children	1

agent:watching him all day|user:um-hum|agent:girls were there in the morning and then some substitute teachers in the afternoon and they actually taught him something instead of just	right	1
agent:i think his attachments at home and you know he gets the idea of what school is for and uh you know i have different teachers here and|user:right|user:um-hum	hum	1
user:yeah|agent:we had a good experience and we really did well|agent:but	well that's good that's good	1

agent:isometrics stuff like that|agent:oh okay|user:i[t's]- it's um like isolated movements for each muscle certain muscles groups you can do with	yeah you can do it with certain you know you can do it with weights if you wanted to but	0
agent:but uh ever ever since i got out of school you know just jumped right into the job and|user:oh yeah|user:oh yeah	um-hum	1
agent:so|user:um-hum|agent:get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant	yeah it's uh	1
agent:oh if you do if you do aerobics you shouldn't have any problem running|user:[laughter] i'm afraid i won't be able [laughter-to]|user:i'm	i wish i'd	1
agent:[laughter]|agent:yeah|user:would be considered [laughter-exercise] or things i should do	i know [vocalized-noise]	1
user:yeah they're wei[rd]- they're weird they're uh you get uh|agent:i think my wife has some|agent:yeah	they're just made of i guess it's different kinds of	0
user:with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that's|user:uh i think uh|user:those classes i i enjoy	fun if you don't have one that's fun and not enjoy it look not acting like she's enjoying what she's doing the class is not going to get out	0
agent:they they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups|agent:the uh the some of the Nautilus equipment that i started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting i mean they|agent:yeah	um-hum	1
user:yeah [laughter]|agent:a little negative reinforcement there while you're going|user:and stuff like a turtle goes faster and um it tells it and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you	so uh do that stuff like that	0
agent:since i stopped playing which was about four years ago|agent:i haven't really started to put on a lot of weight i'm i guess i probably put on about ten nine or ten pounds|agent:um-hum	uh-huh	1
agent:um-hum|user:about yourself just that you know|agent:yeah	you don't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner [laughter]	1
user:few are|agent:yeah|user:i guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force	uh basically staying home and	1
agent:women stayed home with the kids you know and try to give the kids quality time|agent:old days where you know|agent:you know women have come into the work force in the last twenty thirty years and now they're wanting to go back to the	uh-huh	1
agent:um they're real active in volunteer work|user:huh|agent:yeah believe it or not though the all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home	uh-huh	1
agent:the peo[ple]- people were a lot better back then as far as having higher standards|agent:um it seems like there was|agent:um a lot of the the things that are going on in today's society i think morally	true	0
user:it's hard to say|user:the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so and it got higher than that for a while um|user:they'll understand them	families are such a strange configuration anymore	0
user:it's not not a real functional situation anyway|user:so|agent:yeah	i don't know it's i don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families and the blended families	0
agent:well i need to go ahead and and wrap it up it was|user:yeah i think so too|agent:the strain worthwhile	okay	1
user:it certainly needed|user:although with the Russian situation and all the world situation changing the way it is uh|agent:yeah	i the obvious one that people all talk about that i still don't understand is uh	0
agent:right yeah|user:why they don't talk about it i mean they don't bring it up at all why you would think they'd be real having a real campaign with one party or the other|user:i'm amazed that n[either]- neither party or or the which i guess they're independent parties too	and they never talk about it they just keep doing it you know	1
user:he wanted to start|agent:yeah|user:where one of the congressmen i think it was from Connecticut and i probably will will screw that up but	another drug headquarters in his state	0
agent:doesn't isn't realistic about what he see you know what he's doing the guy who says well we should raise taxes|user:right exactly|user:right yeah exactly	right	1
user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:the the problem is that the budget is so complicated and what they're doing are the things that are easy they're making the easy choices|agent:yeah	well then that's probably true	1
user:right right|agent:regular people who were who you know these were the doctors and the lawyers and the accountants and the janitors and the uh who were in there for their brief period of time to do their|agent:uh so healthy about our our former government is that these were	right	1
user:you know that kind of a thing|agent:right|user:i like it because there's a little bit of everything in it	uh as far as like real novels	0
agent:but uh not to say i wouldn't|agent:i really like|agent:haven't found a lot of uh fiction books that	yeah	1
agent:y[eah]- y[eah]- yeah|agent:uh-huh|user:i don't know it seems like you can get lost in a book you know it it it's like an escape for me i don't know about you	it's if i'm really interested in what i'm reading i mean hours can go by and i i look up at the clock and say oh my word you know	1
user:even if i'm|user:that's why i i don't know i'm i'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that|agent:yeah	uh doing something like an afghan if i'm close to the end	0
agent:that was really good|user:uh|agent:which what book have you read that is along those lines	t[o]- to to give you specific titles i c[an't]- i can't	0
user:how he started out as just a salesman and now he's you know multimillionaire and that type of thing and|agent:uh-huh|user:it was more like oh it there was tapes and things that they had about him too	uh how you have to uh	0
agent:there may be some schools you could read about and learn|user:but|user:like i am you know and and i wish i could be more that way	that's true that's true how many people do you supervise	1

agent:oh yeah|user:any interest in it at all and i think it's important|agent:[laughter]	because uh even today where people are so	0
agent:seems like wanting to go to the Peace Corps was something that i had really wanted to do when i was young|user:can you speak up please|agent:seems like i it it was something that i- i really wanted wanted to do	yes	1
user:some of the people that have|user:no i'm not|agent:your kidding	been involved with Peace Corps	0
user:yeah but|agent:goodness i'm surprised i really had no idea|user:for better public hygiene	so do you think that	1
user:to the|user:twenty sixth birthday to give a year or two to the|user:seventeenth and uh	country in the form of maybe building better roads or the parks service or	1
user:for a couple years of their lives|user:giving|agent:i don't i don't think that	or or uh	1
user:away|user:taking|user:they would have given something to the country instead of take	all their lives	1

user:i|agent:i real[ly]- i really don't see anything wrong with it i just don't think that it should be mandatory that every person have to do that|agent:um-hum	i can't see the problem in it for a year	1
agent:that it you know that they would have enough|agent:all right i wonder if if they didn't make it mandatory if they would actually get enough people volunteering t[o]- t[o]- to do it|user:it would definitely effect unemployment	i don't know	1
user:and who knows maybe|user:there would darn sure be more hours labor available in the nation for everyone else|user:off the streets for a year	some of our	1
agent:so what i'm saying they they get the money anyway they can|agent:right|user:be it selling drugs or whatever	yeah yeah	1
user:i suspect uh let's see [noise] i suspect we should do what everyone says we should do we should cut spending and maybe even raise taxes but|user:i don't uh|user:damned if i know um [laughter]	Lord knows you sh[ouldn't]- one shouldn't say that	1
agent:then we would have more money there to play with|agent:lowest and the highest income Americans|agent:the	oh that's interesting	0
agent:well|user:and that way just create more jobs|user:hum	or whatever	1
agent:reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another|agent:out of the hands of criminals i think it would put|agent:take some of that money	that's probably true	1
agent:that's just sensible on their part|user:right|agent:their families better through whatever means	that's just what on their part i'm sorry i missed that	0
agent:reduce them through legal means i think we ought to just tax them severely|agent:re[duce]-|agent:that we ought to	right well that that's what happened in other country though	0
agent:that would put a lot of a lot of Millspec and NASA work operates to the same demanding specifications|agent:for me to go because|user:right	um-hum	1

user:approval almost like the United Way campaign where you agree with most of the agencies but uh don't agree with some of them|user:i i don't know i find myself in a position sort of like selective|user:but uh	and	1
agent:it just seems since that time the bureaucratic machine has just gotten so out of control|agent:really got interested in politics and keeping up with it|agent:i guess about seventy five	oh yes	1
user:centered on such|user:one of the other problems that i have recently is|user:the	things as the trip by Dan Quayle to Augusta Georgia to play golf	1
user:like i enjoy seeing money spent on the Smithsonian Institute in Washington i think it's one of the nicest national treasures and i love to see|user:but other things uh|user:so that's what i meant about the selectives some things i think we're doing extremely wrong could save a lot of money	kids of uh	0
agent:i i've got a big hang-up with that|user:oh i think it's way|agent:these countries to run their own governments	it's way out of hand i'm almost turning into an isolationist [laughter]	0
user:oh yeah|agent:that's something i would and that subject in itself i'd love to see that entire thing revised|user:i have some problem with social programs at home in terms of making it too convenient to be on on welfare	yeah i i think when you get to a point where it's more economical to stay on welfare than it is to get a job	0
user:governance|user:one person in our system of uh|user:by a stroke of a pen i think our president can forgive foreign debt and that's a lot of power vested in one	and i've seen that happen	1
user:no let's see|user:yeah well your your neighbor to the north Oklahoma just voted for state legislators uh one term|agent:they're not going to do anything to t[ap]- tap out the well	i forget was it one term or two term	1

user:in the same position and really don't give a hoot who gets elected|user:that's an issue i think that really fits into it because there are a lot of people that sit|user:uh it doesn't solve the non elected bureauc[rats]- bureaucrats either that's	they still kind of run the show and and setup all the roadblocks and the	1
user:How do you feel about the information we get|user:yeah|agent:ready to put their hand on the first wrench and tighten the first bolt	uh	1
agent:is almost is going to be impossible to do|agent:report what they did vote for what they didn't vote for when they were actually on the floor at their desk|agent:politicians to actually truthfully	yeah it	1
agent:that's a pretty big dog|user:and we got a Dalmatian|agent:i can imagine	yeah and h[e]-	0

user:uh whole county now i- i know the concept of counties in Texas is quite a bit different than it is here in Maryland uh like Collin County|user:and so it it works out nice it it it makes it so that the|agent:oh well that's pretty good	uh would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of Baltimore County here in Maryland	0
user:um|agent:yeah|user:running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something	[noise] they said since they imposed the federal regulations on education	0
agent:high school graduates can't even match the national average|agent:Texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation that our|agent:well they say that	yeah	1

agent:oh like Four H then|agent:um-hum|user:but it goes along the the lines of industrial arts but it's [vocalized-noise] agricultural and where they had to raise a small animal	had to learn how to drive a tractor	1
user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter-yeah] yeah just something i have to do everyday|user:and it was you know it was like [laughter] kind of like the way we feel about going to work [laughter]	but uh up here they seem to have made it uh a lot of fun for them_1 and they they seem to really enjoy it	1
user:um|agent:[noise] that's why i prefer if i'm going to shop at a discount place that's where i like to shop is because of that|user:yeah that's where i bought it as a matter of fact yeah	um-hum	0
agent:uh-huh it really|user:it's worse the service is worse it really is than buying|user:[vocalized-noise]	new because um people just don't know how to fix things now and	0

agent:uh-huh|agent:yeah|user:and let's see the question was what benefits you consider most important i think uh definitely medical and dental insurance	um	0
agent:say ten point five hours in a three month period|agent:if they miss more than|agent:uh personal time off but	um-hum	1
agent:it's not really uh consistent|agent:that's true it is|agent:uh-huh	but	0
agent:yeah|user:and i think they should even do something for when children are sick you know provide facilities for sick children|agent:so i don't know i- i really think a big company needs to take responsibility for that	although i know that's not very comfortable for the children when they're sick they probably just would rather stay home but um	1
agent:how many vacation days do you get a year|agent:what kind of uh|agent:um	[noise] well [vocalized-noise] i get three weeks	1
user:um-hum|agent:i've only worked there three years and i- i get five days every six months well|agent:TI isn't doing very well so like i'm i'm negative vacation because	um-hum	1
agent:yeah i have to pay for my husband which is kind of expensive for him i mean it's like|user:does your company pay for it or do you pay for it|agent:yeah mainly because i haven't had really had to use it much i mean	do you have flexible benefits where you can get sort of like pick and choose	1
agent:[laughter-yeah]|user:oh okay well then i guess that's makes a difference|agent:ours is only up to four percent though	[laughter]	1
user:yeah|agent:that's kind of a rip|user:so	but more and more companies are going to that now	1
agent:[noise]|user:sister worked at the uh|agent:uh-huh	uh	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh|user:so sometimes uh especially traveling with TI you know everything goes on American Express	and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping	1
agent:[laughter]|user:then you really get socked to it if you don't watch it|agent:yeah	how how do you	0
agent:ye[ah]- yeah and then some of them add late fees on it and say they don't get paid and|agent:yeah|agent:[laughter]	yeah	1
agent:uh-huh|user:but that's the one that your cost center manager sees every month|agent:yeah	so you're	0

user:well i do a little bit i just do mainly you know change the oil and uh i'll do an occasional tune-up things like that|agent:so do you do any of your own repairs or maintenance work|user:[noise]	change set of disc brakes but most of the stuff i have done i just don't have time to fool with it or	0
agent:getting into that kind of hassle|user:yeah|agent:has happened that you didn't know about and Advanced Auto closed fifteen minutes ago and	[noise] well have you had anything done to yours lately or	1
user:[laughter]|agent:wow|user:it was twelve hundred bucks	so something something that small and that minor uh well it's not really minor but something that small	0
user:but uh|agent:yeah|user:so i just rather than get tied up in in a bunch of you know garbage i just went ahead and and got it done and and to heck with it	and then the the truck i have i have uh	0
user:but uh they are probably one of the nicest running cars i've ever driven|agent:okay|user:i think it still has fuel injection there's i think the DX is the one that does not	they run good and they're and they're peppy	1
agent:it's been an absolute nightmare for them|agent:or says well it's supposed to be that way just get used to it|agent:either says there's nothing wrong it's your imagination	hum	1
agent:um-hum|user:if i had to say dollar for dollar spending on foreign and as opposed to to American|user:i have had	i spent far less on the foreign cars	1
user:good reliability but they're scaling up whereas the Americans now are scaling down|user:keep good gas mileage|user:are able to keep the same ga[s]- or keep	and they can't improve the gas mileage anymore	0
user:and i know a lot of people that have Ford trucks|user:except i've got a Ford truck|user:yeah	and really they're very maintenance free	1
user:and uh that's why i buy Ford trucks|agent:really|user:you can't even come close to a Ford	mine runs like a top it it i've like i say i've had absolutely nothing wrong with it other than taking it in for normal maintenance	0
agent:yeah|user:they're they're good cars i- i- i will say that you probably made a good choice|agent:you know you're not sure what you're going to get when you change	in that one	0
user:no|agent:and probably not quite as big as Dallas but uh|user:oh okay	well myself i- i go to Richardson which is a i teach school and so i don't [vocalized-noise] commute that far it's only about four miles but	0
agent:it's about two hundred and fifty thousand|user:how large is Raleigh|agent:i can ride it to downtown with no problem at all	so it's pretty big yeah	1
user:uh-huh|agent:on uh ecology and all that at at a middle school|agent:actually i've done some volunteer teaching on	uh-huh	1
user:it's ridiculous but|agent:yeah|user:well you know it just has to be when you consider the landfills we we're not going to have any soon and it's	the thing that the quandary that i'm in is that that we had a great big article in in in the newspaper last week about	0
user:uh-huh|agent:that's where i see that paper's got to be better|agent:i mean that's that's where the main	well you know and they say that	0
agent:not too slowly but [laughter]|user:right right|agent:and uh	well you know just	0
agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	okay	0
agent:give something of themselves|agent:it's important for people to uh also share|agent:i agree with you in the sense that uh i think that	right	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:yeah|user:or something they would understand how other people live	and uh	0
agent:yeah in in other words they don't dwell on on what they don't have they dwell on what they do have and they're happy with each other type of thing|agent:uh|user:um-hum demeanor yeah	um-hum	1
agent:right|user:but you they don't know what poor is|agent:yeah	unless they actually see it and you know help or something	1
user:it's|agent:uh-huh|user:or something like that and you can help a child	i don't know i guess it's just me but i don't know whether to trust that or not	0
agent:and it's uh people you know grow from a small town to a large town|user:um-hum|agent:a town change from a town to a city	um-hum	1
agent:if you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe you know|user:um-hum|user:uh-huh	yeah even when when i first moved to Dallas from New York	0
agent:okay with nothing missing|user:wow|agent:this is how confident they were	wow	1
agent:you know she had there are certain|user:yeah yeah|agent:being a woman alone	th[at]- that's a big	0
agent:and that that's why i think if people were more exposed to|user:you know instead of|user:for me to be you know i feel very safe where i am	um-hum	1
user:yeah|agent:and i don't know i- i attributed i think a lot of that to women working|user:um-hum	and it	1
agent:so to speak okay it it's what's important to you|user:right|user:right	um-hum	1
agent:okay|user:all right|agent:[noise]	what uh what baseball teams do you follow	1
user:oh|agent:yeah do you go to a lot of games|user:jammed in there	i get to i don't know quite a few in the summer	1
agent:you got to like that you know and building the team through draft picks and stuff like that|agent:and the draft and uh|user:yeah	yeah it says a lot for their future	1
user:uh maybe|user:yeah they have been off and on|agent:so they were contenders till about three or fours years ago	maybe three or four times since they've been here	1
user:well i i can understand his point i thought it was kind of childish to just cut him instead of trying to trade him because then Detroit picks him up and|agent:you didn't like that move|user:because he was upset at him	he started out real good for them and he he's gotten kind of shaky now	1
agent:blossom and make me a rich man someday|agent:so i'm hoping he's going to|user:hum	yeah [laughter] that'd be nice	1
agent:yeah yeah|user:well but it didn't didn't seem to really hurt the team in fact seemed to kind of fire them up and make them work harder|agent:carried over and has hurt his image and everything else	after he was gone	1
agent:and we find the campgrounds that have facilities which is really nice because there are a lot of them across the United States now|agent:and so we take our tent and we pitch it and our kids are just great at camping my husband and my son are scouts [noise] and are very adept at that kind of thing and so it makes it a successful thing you know we just pitch the tent|user:um-hum	right	1

user:you know stayed there over night|user:and it was still raining Sunday morning we went over and set up camp and|user:uh like that was a Saturday morning and it rained all day Saturday	we couldn't do anything so as soon as we woke up Sunday morning we you know we had breakfast and then we all came back home	0
agent:oh how fun|agent:uh-huh|user:but uh yeah we had we've had some really good experiences i[t]- it's been several years since i've been camping but uh as a matter of fact my son uh is camping now he camps every weekend he	he's uh involved with the uh	1
agent:um-hum|user:but yeah that's we uh my my wife and i took the uh the scout leadership training program|agent:we've done that before uh-huh	and we really had a good time with that we did have a uh	0

agent:oh no [noise]|agent:oh no|agent:oh no	where the h[air]- the heat came up out of the dryer you know	0
user:sit there and|agent:was the drumming|user:and he didn't he the only thing he didn't like very well was the drumming when Dan would drum he'd	scrunch up you know like he was trying to	0
user:and sometimes he would just make a racket until you came and got him and one night we'd forgotten to put water out for him and and Hal and i were in bed and all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the house and|user:for a while they built a a run for him out to the side of the house you know he'd been on the patio but they put the run out there and he didn't like this run because there were no people that came by|user:uh	and he'd pick up his dish and throw it in the air [laughter]	0
agent:oh my|user:uh it got too cold up there and he he died in a tree tha[t]- they found him the next day in a tree he was dead|agent:oh	so you ca[n't]- you have to be pretty tender with them we had a he had his own heat lamp and uh and uh hot pad he laid on you know	0
user:the winter time there was no smell at all no odor at all to it in the summertime when he was outside|agent:oh my goodness|user:it dried up a little bit like ashes and you could just vacuum it up	and eating outside the smell was a little bit like a cat you know	1
user:[laughter]|agent:oh my goodness these guys th[ey]- well actually they're my husband's pets|user:what do your cats do besides sitting and purring and letting you pet them_1 [laughter]	yeah	1
user:[laughter]|user:yeah|agent:[laughter] the [laughter] he is something he's like a dog he really he just flops for you he just wants his belly scratched and that's it you know	yeah	1
user:i usually stick m[ainly]- mainly with something i can put on the grill usually i'll get a|agent:right|agent:right	something like a Filet Mignon little eight ounce Filet Mignons and i'll marinate them_1	0
user:and put a little sugar in there and a little Worcestershire sauce|agent:uh-huh|user:a good red wine	and and garlic and pepper	1
user:same mixture|user:then i marinate mushrooms the same way i use the same|agent:yeah	but i just add i add a little butter in with the mushrooms and saute those	0
agent:some frozen what|user:i'll leave the the peel on them_1 and steam those and then i'll i'll pour some uh frozen peas|agent:uh-huh	frozen peas	1
user:uh let's see probably|agent:yeah one that you when you're in a hurry for a decent meal|user:my best simple one	stir fried	0
user:yeah|agent:you like the electric one then|user:and it does it does as good as anything	they're easy to clean you know they have the the nonstick uh	0
agent:well what what goes in them_1 i mean|user:uh they're not really that tough after you after you do it about two or three times the first few times learn how to wrap them_1 and everything else that that's really the key it's what goes in it is very simple|agent:i've never tried egg rolls	uh	1
user:and then kind of roll it up and|agent:uh-huh|user:and you just put the stuff in there in the middle you just take a spoonful of it and put it in the middle kind of form it you know like a tube	wrap the edges around it and roll it up all the way and then put a little bit of egg	0
user:but uh|agent:right|user:and that that should just you have to kind of taste one to see you know see if it's done or not	there's all kinds of neat little stuff i- i mean i enjoy it i just i get in the kitchen sometimes just try new stuff	0
agent:oh you talk Rotel tomatoes|user:and uh then they have other stuff in there with them_1 green peppers and stuff i just toss one of those in there|agent:they're peeled	do what	1
agent:and ground it up|user:uh-huh|agent:yeah if you take that sausage that tube sausage	it's good	1
agent:in Texas i've only been here about a year or two|agent:[laughter-well] [laughter-it] [laughter-seems] [laughter-like] every weekend we're somebody's got a cookout going on here|user:cookout everyday	oh yeah	1
agent:uh-huh|user:which does give it the appearance but i just i like the i like to be able to push the starter and have it light up|agent:uh-huh	and it you know if you do soak some of those hickory chips or pecan chips or you know	0
agent:[laughter]|user:in the kind of job or well i think that you probably have a full-time job if you're a college student|user:uh types of wardrobe that one might need to have	a full-ti[me]- do you consider that full-time	1
user:yes|agent:i would just say the only difference is you know like long sleeve and short sleeve between summer and winter|agent:so um	yes um what year are you in college	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and i went and had that uh Color Me Beautiful thing done [noise]|user:or that i wanted to wear	and uh	0
user:those bei[ge]- good looking cashmere beige suits|agent:um-hum|user:i have dark hair and kind of sallow {reddy} complexion and um	that i wanted so badly were horrible on me	0
user:and do you know it made traveling and working so much more simple|agent:uh-huh|user:in the colors that i out that i already to the colors that i already had that i could wear plus i bought some	because and i i did away with all those colors that	0
user:suits|agent:uh-huh|user:when i would wear those beige	so	0
user:yes exactly|agent:i wear a lot of like a magenta or a hot pink color you know and and in those shades|agent:um	[noise] uh-huh	1
agent:oh yeah i already started buying suits and i've already you know i've bought the suits that i always wear [laughter-colors] [laughter-in] [laughter-so]|user:will do you probably for several years|user:keep that in mind because those those pieces of clothing	yeah uh-huh	0
user:uh-huh|agent:and i have a number of different blouses i could wear with it one blouse that looks really nice with it is a real deep red blouse|agent:i have um this suede suit it's a double breasted coat with a skirt	sounds pretty	1
agent:no i don't even wear white stockings with this just because it's just too much white with the white shoes and everything|user:uh in fact she doesn't give white a real high grade|user:uh	it's too white isn't it	0
agent:yeah|agent:um-hum|user:the skirt and the shoes and you count you think of it as a total outfit	but it said also they find that navy skirt and navy stockings and navy shoes are very boring [laughter]	1
EMPTY	so i personally uh do consider the Soviet Union a threat i- i- i think that although there's been some fundamental changes and that there's uh uh the uh	1
agent:um-hum|user:right well i guess that that that brings up a question is it their i think in in the long term we could see a a situation where there are in [vocalized-noise] incredible civil wars and that the the structure of the country breaks down and there's strife and much much death|agent:uh they've got enough problems keeping their own people happy to worry about you know nuking other people who aren't bothering them	but until that happens be[tween]- between now and then there's a lot of other	0
agent:um and they so so i guess since the primary question is whether or not it's a military problem that's less than clear to me i mean if they're smart they're just going to let us head toward communism on our own very merry way|user:that's right|agent:uh [laughter] so um you know they might be perfectly happy to sit back and wait for it to happen [noise]	that's right	1
agent:and so for a moment Dan Quayle might have been [laughter] uh having his finger on the trigger and God knows what that would have done|agent:put this in perspective i mean George Bush was recently in the hospital|agent:but you know just just to	[laughter]	1

agent:right i understand uh and it is hard i there i work with a girl here that just went through a very traumatic change she has one that is uh six months old and another one that is three years old|agent:right|user:of having nothing else is what's uh unfortunate	yeah	1
user:that uh|user:you know it's a sad thing|user:and in some ways i[t]- rightly so	that you you realize the child care if it's done right	0
agent:right|user:sat and played and intermingled with them_1 you know and read to them_1 and change their pants and fed them_1 and|user:you know her interaction with the children she didn't do anything else all day she just	a[nd]- moved them_1 from one [laughter-thing] [laughter-to] [laughter-another]	0

EMPTY	[noise] okay Amy uh what do you think about taking care of the elderly	1
agent:you know have like a little separate wing or something where i wouldn't have to constantly be having my children you know be quiet and go away and that kind of thing to accommodate an elderly person|agent:and um we don't have a real large house if you had a lot of money and you were able to|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:it it would really be hard because when we go to visit i'm sure that places have you know their best foot forward kind of thing unless you drop in frequently and kind of get the since of what's going on behind the scenes it w[ould]- really would be hard to know it's kind of similar in away to some of the things you look for in going to try and find day care for your kids|agent:the things i brought up you know that i thought were important for my family member|user:[noise] right	yeah	1
agent:um-hum|user:to the point where she can't take care of the home herself that she would consider uh|user:my mother ever gets	the apartment type	1
user:you know a bigger issue as you know the medical profession continues|agent:so|user:yeah it's she'll become uh	to you know	0

agent:[noise]|user:bye|user:all right	[noise]	1
user:uh still you have to deal with the people that you know happen to be operating it locally|agent:right|user:quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain if i can use that word	and uh it's just a matter of	0
agent:at one point in time we've had au pairs|user:um-hum um-hum|agent:more creative avenues were the right answer for us uh	um-hum	1
user:these children were small you know four or five years old up until they were well into grade school|user:uh care givers and they they loved it they had stayed with this family from the time|user:right i do have a friend that uh uh she and her roommate became live in	and uh she was paid very well because they the parents trusted them and they you know had done such a good job	0
user:you know it's just there's so much pressure when you're talking about uh two people that work|user:and that's that's that's sad to have to admit too but uh|user:yeah	outside the home and and i think that's one reason why i	0
agent:most of the time it's worth it|agent:that|user:um-hum um-hum	yeah [laughter-most] [laughter-of] [laughter-the] [laughter-time]	0
user:might want to stay home or he as well but you know that they need the money|user:you know i have friends that [vocalized-noise] struggle financially and and they both do have to work it's a matter of not necessarily uh that she|user:the thing about the child care i	and uh when i seen some of my my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know to someone else and	0
user:right right right|user:uh-huh|agent:[omniscious/omniscent] [omniscipotent/omnipotent] they're they are not all things to all people or all children	yeah	1

agent:because_1 i didn't need it|agent:for many years|user:[laughter]	uh-huh	1
agent:that's true what one leads the other you know|user:that's just a difference in kids i suppose [noise]|user:yeah yeah	yeah	1
user:i don't know i- i- i have to admit i was a self[ish]- i was selfish as a child i didn't want a brother or sister and now that i'm older of course it's different|agent:[laughter]|user:[laughter-that's] [laughter-like] [laughter-World] [laughter-War] [laughter-Three] [laughter-every] [laughter-minute]	you know i think about uh wouldn't it be nice	0
agent:and then you don't really know what happened we gave up on one babysitter because we came home one night|user:um-hum um-hum|agent:that you don't really understand	yeah	1
agent:oh i don't know a little le[ss]- a little less bigoted in some ways i don't know|user:really|agent:when i was eighteen things haven't changed a whole lot people are being a little more uh	uh-huh	1
agent:i think|user:uh you know uh [vocalized-noise] as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a|user:yeah	tough job to do	1
agent:got to|user:yeah th[ink]- i think there's more pressure like|agent:i'm no [laughter-longer] a teenager in high school	on both parents to work and things like that than there used to be and	1
user:yeah the way that like tax laws and stuff are structured you can't ever|user:yeah just because they can't get into one yeah that's right|agent:forever you know you just don't buy a house	catch a break until you can get into a house	0

user:[noise] i haven't talked to him in a while but|user:but uh|user:and uh he works over in the Park Park Central building i think	um	0
user:[noise]	okay uh i really haven't thought about the topic of drug testing but uh just off the top of my head	1
agent:maybe there are some jobs where i guess it doesn't really|user:um-hum|agent:the job	hum	1
user:it follows|user:yeah for me i think that drug testing just i[t]-|agent:necessary	the path that society's going in if more and more people are using drugs then i think that some people have to	0
agent:i don't know the uh that that would actually be an interesting thing to find out i think i don't i don't actually know how long those things stay in the blood in the system i've heard some you know you so some things supposedly stay for six months some stay for less some stay for longer i mean|agent:yeah i don't know|user:you know i'm saying they can't they may not be able trace don't know how far you trace i don't know what the you know limits are or whate[ver]-	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:of some sort so i don't really know|user:hum|user:um-hum	yeah	0
agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:so the only thing i would hate is if i were to|user:um-hum	go and uh i mean it's kind of the same thing with the lie de[tector]-	0
agent:so|user:yeah yeah|user:um-hum	i mean i i took a lie detector test once and it did[n't]- i didn't mind it but	0
user:yeah [laughter]|agent:it can be shocking and it they want to see how easy it is shock you|user:um-hum	they ask that i was going what in the world are you asking me about here you know it's just	1
user:getting off drugs and trying to do better with their lives|user:i mean because society a lot of people are taking drugs there is also people that are|user:i don't think that some thing i mean there are some people	but they take a lie detector test or a drug test or whatever and the stuff that happened to them you know five years ago comes up and it spoils their chances	0
agent:but yeah it['s]- it['s]- it['s]- it's an interesting topic that they've actually thought about your right in that it doesn't|user:but|agent:i don't i don't of this stuff	um-hum yeah i the other day we had talked about uh	1
agent:the[n]- then this'll probably be i mean this isn't really excellent Italian food that sounds terrible to tell you go go somewhere where it's not that great|agent:then don't|user:it's it's not my favorite but i like it okay	uh-huh	1
user:right but when my husband and i go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere and we usually head on down um|user:right|agent:yeah and you can usually get a variety of what you're looking for like at Gatti's or something like that	oh what's the freeway down here	1
agent:the food is probably i'm not a i'm i'm not a Mexican food gourmet by any means but it's probably the best tasting i i don't know if it would you classify that as Tex-Mex|user:[laughter-yeah] but i love the food i love the food they just are great|agent:too much like a bar naturally and Mexico yeah i know i've seen it	yeah um-hum	1
agent:i'm glad i'm talking about food normally these conversations are [laughter]|user:[laughter-yeah] [laughter-yeah]|agent:yeah and i don't know how you feel about that but i think some of it's over priced	that's true	0
user:[laughter]|agent:and i remember when we went [laughter] we were married with another couple that was just dating and um|user:ooh	uh-huh	1
user:[laughter-yeah] yeah [laughter] free ice cream|agent:oh and my husband's going upstairs and he said and free ice cream [laughter] i didn't know they had that oh|agent:there had	yeah	1
agent:that's the way to yeah well we're getting ready to i shouldn't say this on this conversation but it's just on my mind we're getting ready to go overseas to adopt|user:they're good kids|user:well i love them_1	so	1
agent:the yuppie kind of crowd yeah yeah|user:go for that atmosphere kind of thing and|user:too much of a distraction and some restaurants are really trying to	wha[t]- yeah	1
agent:um|user:y[eah]- [laughter-oh] [laughter-dear]|agent:right like you're in a bad part of I[taly]- Italy or something	oh	1
agent:i guess they mean just one that's in your home|user:uh|user:you know it's uh i'm a CPA so i use computer quite a bit uh i'm not sure why they call them sometimes call them personal computers	yeah righ[t]- well ye[ah]- actual i think they mean one that's that is uh	0
user:Prior to that i had uh|user:which is one of the earlier models|user:i have an IBM it's uh one they call the XT	one that was a Heath Kit computer which is one that i	1
user:back then the computer that i built was uh one you know was a old pretty low|user:uh|agent:oh	level technology wise	0
agent:uh-huh|user:well i i say uh i said basically i built it myself when i got to a certain point i took it to a TI engineer|user:you know i had to had to learn a little bit about uh using a solder iron and and that kind of stuff	that uh was a friend of my wife's and	1
user:well you can have them connected by a by a modem if you want to|user:oh yeah oh|agent:one in your home that has the same stuff in it as your office does or have it kind of connect it	which is a telephone line	0
agent:microwaves all have these new little buttons and|agent:more or less close the computers the uh|agent:well a lot of them_1	right yeah	1
user:have to have computer for the students to use you know in every class uh right now i teach over at Brookhaven College|user:um accounting classes in college|user:i was just commenting the other night that it's uh going to reach the point where	and there's only one class that i happen to teach that that teaches the accounting students	0
agent:uh-huh|user:if uh if you have a computer you can buy you know some little cheap software that uh that uh you can buy like at Software House here in Richard in uh Dallas at uh over in Addison|agent:computer	you can go over there and buy an income tax package that will run on a personal computer	1
agent:and he'll be four|user:uh-huh|agent:i know they've got toy computers more or less just for kids who just starting	yeah	1
agent:yes|user:been nice talking to you and uh|user:yeah so it's been	guess uh m[aybe]- maybe they'll ring us up again sometime	1
user:electric or|user:into the utiliti[es]- anything that's to do with the house like utilities or|user:into the car	anything like that goes into the house budget	0
agent:d[oes]- does it i mean does it work pretty good i mean you are you able to stay on track pretty much|user:and that's pretty much how we do it|agent:um-hum	yeah	1
user:and i don't do that usually but when it does happen then i get into problems with|user:um to buy more food|agent:um-hum	you know then i have to take money from somewhere else to pay the bills on the house	0
user:uh|user:and what the his um company does for us is we allot a certain amount and like you said|agent:um-hum	they ta[ke]- they just take that straight out of the paycheck and put it right in the savings account	0
agent:so in case one of us decides to get weak or something like that you know say well you know if we won't miss this or we won't miss that you know|user:i think that's great|agent:in fact like CDs and money markets and all kind of stuff we've got it set up to where it takes both of us to sign it	yeah	1
user:it's too hard|agent:so i think if parents don't provide it's it's not going to be there|user:yeah	that's right	1
user:we would|user:um|user:the only reason i even went to a budget was i found that we	oh i can't think of the word	0
user:yeah|agent:sitting around that you can invest more in or do some other things that are a little bit more important|agent:uh than what we can pay for but i think if you do have a budget at least then maybe you'll have extra money	i didn't used to have uh a money allotted out for debt service	0
agent:i know just one little one little hiccup|user:yeah|agent:i say isn't that something about_1 medical bills golly	[laughter-yeah]	1
user:when you do that|agent:in some basic sense|user:uh	right right	1
user:uh o[n]- on the statement|user:or whoever takes money out of the ATM i write down that amount of money and as it comes through|user:for the amount of money	then i'll b[lock]- block it off in in a bright color so we know it's gone and i can see what's left out	0
agent:take down all this this information and put it into their format so that they can put it on to their computer and and know that a given|agent:and uh companies that do this kind of research hire people to sit there at the at the records office and|agent:they never told you it would be considered private but whenever you buy a house uh the purchase price is there for everybody to see where it's located is there and	right	1
agent:[laughter-so] it's kind of a strange deal do you have a phone that uh|user:right|agent:their phones and ironically the laws have has classified one of them as illegal to listen to and the other one not	no i don't have a cordless	1
user:you know if they they want to do a che[ck]- background check on you they've got|agent:um-hum|user:i think the government uses is quite a bit	y[ou]- everything on you from the time you got that social security card	1
agent:get's to be a a real chore with little kids who basically want every thing covered in cheese|agent:and it's not going to be fattening high in fat or high in cholesterol|agent:and i'm trying to figure out how how to feed him so he'll eat this stuff [laughter] and the kids will eat it too	right that's true	0
user:would be our night|user:uh every Friday night|user:but i tell you what we use to do even when the children were growing up	that um	0
agent:give me something that's really easy to do|user:so i can give you something that we like to do|user:um	or	1
user:and bread crumbs and mix it all together|user:fresh peppers and fresh tomatoes and fresh celery|user:and then cut up	and	0
agent:uh-huh|user:so they're fairly soft|user:and i put them in a microwave and cook them [noise]	and i slice them i peel the yam	0
user:close the tin foil and i throw it on the grill|agent:uh|user:put butter and salt on it garlic	cause i like it a little crispy on the bottom	0
agent:and it really only takes about fifteen or twenty minutes to do [laughter] but it gives me forty five minutes to sit by myself where it's quiet|agent:so when he [laughter] when he request this i always tell him he has to take the kids for an hour|user:oh [laughter]	that's nice	1
agent:and you just melt that in a skillet|user:oh yeah [laughter]|agent:which you know most people kind of go [noise] you know this is a a low fat recipe but it is	okay	1
agent:but you know the trick with pork most people think you have to cook it at a hundred and eighty five degrees well done|agent:uh-huh|agent:and	oh no	0

agent:by throwing in some spinach or some tomato or something and mixing it up it it it it's just a snap from there and then you get to roll it out yourself|user:right right|agent:and then um and with that it it becomes really easy to make colorful pasta	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:i usually find it when i make up for the first time i usually doctor it just a little bit you know my own way here and there and it works real well|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1

user:i think we have a lousy school system and i think a lot of it has to do with|agent:and what do you think that problem is|user:i certainly do i think	the fact that we don't train our teachers very well and then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents	0
agent:right|user:and all the auxiliary personnel the school bureaucracy that exists mainly to perpetuate itself|agent:uh-huh	and then i would provide uh use the money that we've been paying them to uh provide some special help in training and particularly uh mentor teachers	0
agent:uh-huh well you should uh run for a school board position|user:[laughter-well] i've done about all i can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people|agent:that's uh some pretty good ideas why don't you do something with those [laughter]	oh well that i'm not so sure about i've got	0
agent:that they could make|agent:how a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class you know if there's some gauge|agent:other than i guess how you kn[ow]-	yeah	1
agent:i don't know if i i'm in favor|user:[laughter]|user:um	i don't think that's going to work	1
agent:hum|agent:um-hum|user:then you had a built-in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject and all you had to do is just get your share of those adopted in the individual school districts	and you know a third of the Texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks	1
user:bye|agent:all righty good-bye|user:i have got to go i've got another line calling thanks	[noise]	1

user:[laughter]|agent:i know i mean i'm almo[st]- i almost got hooked on it cause everybody would took about it at dinner and everything else it you know it's like|user:and to this day twenty years later i'm like i'm in my thirties i'm not that old but i'm going jeez i can't believe that thing's still on [laughter-television]	yeah they you know about the only other kinds of things i like um i like to watch a lot of news um don't you miss that with not having a television so far	1
agent:uh Sherman Texas|agent:yeah|user:no no no i like the pro i like actually i like pro basketball as opposed to ev[en]- i'll watch pro football but i like the NBA play-offs back when like the Pistons were in them_1 and now and where are you calling from	or where	0
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:i like tennis so i mean i'm not i haven't played in years but um i just like to watch you know two two players really get go at it on television	gets boring after a while but i don't	0
agent:really|user:[laughter] i don't know yeah let's see what all's on television oh if you don't have a VCR we just got one after nine years don't even spend your money on it|agent:[laughter] i'd eat too	yeah cause you know if you like movies like we do you do it once in awhile and then you know you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it and then it usually comes on television within two years	0
agent:has it gotten better|user:i mean i haven't seen it in a couple months but used to|agent:huh-uh	uh yeah actually i think it has i mean they finally like Dana Carvey and some of those people they really have some funny characters on there	0
agent:uh Purdue|agent:that's funny|user:is that on tape [laughter] there you go yeah [laughter] oh my what else is on i don't know what did they watch in college when you where in where did you go to school	oh that's a good school	0
user:uh-huh|agent:you know and watch it like four or five times a day|agent:MTV twenty four hours a day and then every now and then they'd watch Days they'd tape Days	okay	1
agent:yeah well that's where the rich see uh certainly have a second third fourth and fifth house|user:tax deductions on uh say a second third fourth house that you own on paying uh taxes on on that|user:that uh you can't uh get uh	right	1
user:um|agent:but on the other hand how how um how would we change it to encourage saving|agent:no it really doesn't	well that that's a good question	1
agent:at a lower interest rate becomes the thing to do|agent:the uh idea of refinancing|agent:drastically such that	right well you can do that with say a mortgage payment but they charge so many points	0
user:right|agent:then i'm not being fairly appraised|agent:uh get again at least what i could have gotten for my house a year ago	there's no justification here for an increase in uh the value of a home	0
agent:or later if if they have the data they don't always have that much data because they may not have sold that many of your model|agent:at least three of them have sold for within the last twelve months|agent:now out here they do they take pictures of house and everything and what they do is they look at what your particular model	okay	1
agent:[laughter]|user:oh i wouldn't know|agent:oh really what kind of square footage	i measured it one time	1
agent:right right [laughter] also i lived in Georgia for about four years so|user:that area that dialect [laughter]|user:oh okay	[laughter]	1
agent:they tend to put windows in the strangest places|agent:there's they uh i know what you're saying there ours is the same and|agent:right	yeah	1
agent:um i'd say almost thirty years old|agent:right i do the house is about|user:you must live in an older home too then	uh-huh	1
user:yeah instead of wallpaper i wouldn't mind it if it was like|user:the huge one|user:the	short tiles for that	0
agent:oh wow i|user:he rewired the house and it's shorting out here and there and|user:and	[laughter]	1
agent:um|user:we hooked it back up and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again|user:and then the power went off again lightning or something knocked it out and	but on the east side of the house it runs fine	1
agent:well that's the way mine is you know i mean he he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around and he was like|user:my husband he'll change out a light switch but that's about as far as he'll go|agent:that's right	yeah [laughter]	1
agent:and i woke up and i got up and it was about four o'clock in the morning and i heard all these these drips drip drip drip drip drip drip|agent:and the wind came in from the north and just blew everything off in the middle of the night and we were asleep and|agent:real thick gauge stuff i mean	oh no	1
user:overdone something i don't know but it was leaking just pouring water and it all went through to her|user:had uh|user:she woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning water dripping from hers the neighbor's [vocalized-noise] uh washing machine	roof and it was coming out of the lights fixtures	0
agent:you know which really wasn't our fault i mean we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather|user:uh-huh|agent:also ended up having to pay for the damage when the r[oof]- roof was being repaired	[noise]	1
user:[noise]	yeah so um	0
user:right i you know i guess i can certainly agree with that|agent:i feel like too much government is too much government [laughter]|agent:i- i feel like	but um	1
user:maybe i don't know much about HMO's but my impression is maybe|user:um-hum|user:right	maybe some uh HMO's are sort of a low form of centralization	1
user:um-hum|agent:uh you know [noise] see one in operation so|agent:that i[n]- in my lifetime i will see	is that because of of the the cost or or government wants it you think	1
user:right|agent:but that's i guess that's [noise] i had not thought about before so|agent:but uh	well it was nice talking to you	0
user:okay|agent:[laughter]|user:[laughter-okay] [noise]	uh you want to start off	1
agent:to continue in that vein i think it got a little bit warped and off the track [vocalized-noise] in several areas but i really do think that women have made a contribution|user:um-hum um-hum|agent:and to make a change you know you have to make a splash but	um-hum	1
agent:team it has to be a team partnership now and they both have to work|user:very much|user:um	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|user:um|agent:absolutely and so that's you know they sort of threw the thing back another you know ten years that they've had to you know restructure but i saw the greatest T-shirt the other day i got to get some for all my men friends it says let men run the world women have more important things to [laughter-do]	[laughter]	1
user:um-hum|user:um-hum|user:yeah yeah	yeah yeah yeah	1
user:right|user:right|user:yeah	yeah	0
user:um-hum|agent:i- i tell you what i don't know what i would do without my friends having all their kids i just love the babies and and since i'm sort of in a medical situation where i can't do that it's|user:it's been real exciting	um-hum	1
agent:all all ego aside do a lot of things that really|agent:being able to you know|agent:just pitching in and and his	uh-huh uh-huh	1
agent:it's so dangerous|user:a um-hum um-hum|agent:yeah but i wish they weren't so many i- i wish they weren't role models for everybody because	it it really is yeah	1
agent:um oh yeah yeah and and i think that um|user:yeah you mean it's stronger there|user:yeah	much stronger yeah	1
agent:and then my other girlfriend that has you know just runs the whole household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy all the time [laughter]|user:ah|agent:working for her and then she has her business in the back	uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh	1
user:and they seem to do fine she has been talk[ing]- has talked about quitting you know and staying home for a few years|agent:uh-huh|user:uh well uh i have one daughter that works full-time she has two little boys	but then it's real hard because she's got an excellent job	1
user:yeah thirty years ago i i had a college job uh working as a programmer|agent:and uh|user:right	and we had to write code in binary and uh [vocalized-noise] have it punched in on those little cardboard [laughter-cards]	0
user:right|agent:yeah and you can you can flip through the commercials so you don't have to watch the commercials|user:i tape it and then watch it when it's convenient and that way i don't have to worry about being interrupted i can just [laughter-put] [laughter-it] [laughter-on] [laughter-pause]	yeah	1
user:kind of bulky and all they did was|agent:yeah|user:uh ten years ago i was working in a job at a medical center and i had to carry a beeper around and they were	just uh make a beep noise and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call	0
agent:wow|user:and they still didn't even know what caused it or anything uh there was a suspicion that it was a virus but nobody had identified it and|user:uh	they were really just going on epidemiological uh	1
user:and let's see twenty years ago i guess we're were just beginning to get into what they were calling the|user:[laughter]|agent:yeah	uh	0
user:four kids in college right now children and stepchildren|agent:yeah|user:i do i really do i have uh	and	0
user:i certainly wouldn't have been able to|agent:yeah|user:and i guess the answer is is stay flexible because nobody can predict what's going to [laughter-happen] [laughter-in] [laughter-twenty] [laughter-years]	twenty years ago tell you what uh	0
user:and even you know that reminds me Federal Express was around ten years ago but it was used|user:yeah|agent:it's pretty wild	as kind of an extreme emergency	0
EMPTY	[noise] okay	1
agent:um-hum|user:probably right if you look at it from that stand point|user:proba[bly]-	what uh is there anything that uh	0
agent:hm|user:but it's pretty congested|agent:um-hum	we are considered in the country but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country	1
agent:um-hum but why why is it happening|user:probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon|user:i would say the majority of it's happening during the day uh between	most	0
agent:hm|user:that sort of stuff|user:are the major targets guns	very few you know penny penny ante stuff	1
user:uh|user:[noise] yeah and and it's i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences|agent:right they're doing that in our state t[oo]-	but for the	1
agent:[noise]|user:uh|agent:hm	especially you you know in the case of murder	1
user:oh|agent:well you probably sue him for mental anguish or something right and try to get money from him and|user:n[o]- no i'm not real familiar with that	well	0
user:you know|agent:um-hum|user:a real real possibility [noise] uh we've had a couple instances where break-ins where the the people have actually	shot the people	1
user:and uh|agent:um-hum [noise]|user:yeah that's i mean that's certainly a a possibility an[d]- an[d]- we have had a a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death	it helps for a while	0
agent:and and worry about these things where people are getting hurt and i think one of the big things that you can do is to increase deterrence is um|user:right|agent:um there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it	[noise]	1
user:but it must be interesting now trying to|agent:um-hum|agent:yeah	do something to a basic ranch style home	0
agent:oh yeah|user:i spent almost three years redoing|user:and uh so i tried to make it after i sold my business i in in	and i considered it a full time job	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:yeah|user:they uh auctioned some tools and things like that but then they went over and started uh	auctioning this big stack of bricks	1
agent:well let me ask you when you laid those bricks i know my parents bought a house about ten years ago they're fixing to sell it again but and move again they're kind of my mom's like i am she's a renovator a lover of old things|user:i hated to leave it|agent:yeah but but you did sta[gger]- stagger back and say oh doesn't this look nice	um-hum	1
user:um|agent:as tight as you can that's probably because_1 they had you know every spring my mom says we're going to have a par[ty]- a barbecue and tell everybody guess what we're going to we're going to redo the [laughter-patio] you know we're going to pull up all the bricks but|user:an eighth of an inch or whatever you just put them together as close as you can	um-hum	1
agent:you know i just had a ball with it it was so much fun|user:wow|agent:but um gosh you know i ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house um up up the stairway even	oh	1
agent:so the number of kids that tend to get hurt i don't even keep the gun in our house so uh we don't have that problem but uh [noise] i[t's]- it's a hard hard topic i guess for a lot of people have a lot of hard issue a lot of hard feelings about it|agent:joy of shooting is is that much of a driving factor i think uh society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety|agent:the	yes	1
agent:yeah|agent:um-hum|user:Dallas yeah that's a big city [laughter] um then you know that uh	uh if you live anywhere real close that uh the safety is uh some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break-ins and you know but uh	0
user:right|user:that's right|user:that's right	that's right	1
agent:right|agent:right|user:i mean i don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either [laughter] so um uh i i think they should have at least some control over over those things um wh[en]- and when you were speaking about [noise] they can check up you know on credit cards well i i understand about the privacy act and everything [noise] but why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not that to me would not be an unreasonable thing and if they do course	the argument with the people in the gun club um is that uh well the people that are going to get guns are the ones who are going to steal them_1 anyway	1
agent:the Gramm the Gramm Rudman Act yeah|user:the act where they had to cut everything across the board|user:uh	they kept doing they kept putting off doing that why did they do that that's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together	1
agent:do you really need this this is going to cost a lot of money oh yes we need it but do you know that the drug agency doesn't want this|user:yeah this is that's right|agent:and it was ridiculous you know the whole thing and and you know they they asked him about it and	yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah when you talk about the trillions of dollars on this and that our national debt in the trillions of dollars you know|user:no you can't even can't even conceive of what they're talking about	yeah	1
user:and get things on a on an even if it were if it were a family we'd be up before the|user:you know|agent:um-hum	the magistrate [laughter]	0
user:yeah i think that's right|agent:i think that paying for school schools is the schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime and so i don't mind paying for school taxes even though my kids will be out of it you know|agent:i have two daughters one's in college already and one's about uh to be in high school but uh	well i don't	0
user:well i think that's right if they don't do if they don't if they don't pull it in and start|user:yeah|agent:i- i think that's a wide open subject what i think that uh people need to take a stand i think the people will here shortly uh	doing something i think they're really going to have to i think	1
user:yeah they've done some good things|agent:looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us you know|agent:we've had good water supply and that's due to the Corps of Engineers building	the state actually did some good good work on that in that a couple of years ago	0
agent:thanks for calling|user:right [laughter]|agent:[laughter] well it's been some interesting subjects yeah	uh-huh bye now	1
user:in society at large|user:some of the so many problems i [vocalized-noise] i work in a high school are that kids don't have a a degree uh a of self-discipline which may be reflected|user:and i was expressing my frustrations that uh	uh and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract uh	0
user:whether maybe through a commitment of the PTA|agent:yeah|user:how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it	uh and the parents being informed better that in fact	0
user:but there are i think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve and this is something that i see|agent:yeah|user:that that's really scary	too many times	0
user:there really needs to be a bridge some sort of|user:and uh|agent:right	transition	1
agent:uh less intelligent than the than the person who|agent:i personally i will i would take a person who's motivated and a little|agent:uh	that's yeah	1
agent:uh-huh|user:this is a we're in a rather wealthy suburb of Washington|agent:you actually have students with with beepers	and a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the uh	0
agent:uh sitting in the barber shop i'm i'm an officer in the Air Force and i was having my hair cut|agent:oh yeah i- i was|user:is there a problem that we should be aware of	um-hum	1
user:i was trying to think [laughter] as i was asking you just exactly what movies i had seen recently i i|user:well uh a few i guess uh|agent:[noise] yeah i have what uh about yourself	took my wife to see one uh	0
agent:wow|user:yeah they well i got one runs around i got two boys and one boy runs around with one his group of friends and the other boy runs around with his group of friends i think both of them separately saw it at two different times even with their group of friends [laughter]|agent:oh they went another time though	and then mom and dad went to see it when it went to the dollar and a half movie house	1
user:but it was fun i think uh|agent:yeah|user:i mean it wasn't a great show it's just a B movie	i think uh you and your wife would enjoy that it's pretty light hearted humor and and and it was uh it was kind of neat kind of cute	1
user:one movie i can't remember the name of it now though but it was uh|user:we went to see|user:uh you know we uh rather enjoyed trying to think of a couple of others that we went to see that	oh what was it i can't remember it's just terrible	0
agent:and he runs around the screen for an hour and half just kicking teeth you know|user:uh-huh|agent:like if we would go see a Von Dame movie	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:yeah that's what the guy told me last night he's like a gangster or something|user:i think's out now|user:Stallone just did a comedy incidentally that uh	yeah yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:and uh so we're going to go see that|user:and you talk about funny at least the little snapshot previews that they've shown on TV advertising it are hilarious i mean it is really funny	now we saw a movie called Sisters	0
user:uh sort of serious piece it had some light moments but basically it was a serious piece|user:no no this this was a real uh|agent:oh okay this was a comedy so it probably wouldn't be the same one	i thought it was just called Sisters or something like that or the The Sisters or The Three Sisters or something	1
agent:yes i have|user:have you seen that|agent:i would suggest that it's	was it really good i- i have heard all kinds of mixed things about it	1
user:yeah|agent:Rain Man|user:that Dustin Hoffman starred in	now wasn't that a good show	1
agent:language is harsh every now and then|agent:but uh you know about Rain Man it was|user:rain man	yeah yeah	1
agent:yeah True Grit|user:i like almost everything he yeah i really love rue Grit|user:oh yeah yeah	and uh	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:yeah|agent:Kelly's Heroes yeah	now that's one of my favorite shows i really enjoy i've been trying to tape that one for years	0
agent:do you remember much about that movie|user:of Kelly Heroes the|user:uh the uh the uh [vocalized-noise] the opening and the closing score	the Kelly's Heroes the movie	0
agent:yep|user:um-hum that's great|agent:and we color a lot and i read her stories and	i think uh a lot of families now for they probably don't spend enough time together	0
agent:yeah and even even when i was when i was uh living with her and we did stuff then too so|agent:um-hum|user:helps j[ust]- just build your family	um-hum	0
agent:um-hum|user:you know kids these days are growing up so much faster|agent:yeah	you know once they hit like ten or eleven or twelve you know you've pretty much lost them_1 [laughter]	1
user:right|agent:because she always likes to do things whenever the TV's off you know she'll forget about the TV completely|user:hm	i think that's the first thing a lot of people do and i know i'm guilty of it like i came in from work today first thing i did was turn the TV on	0
agent:um-hum|user:and that people are you know starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like that|user:um i[t's]- it's becoming really health conscious	and that's probably good you know if you get your family involved in	0
agent:yeah|agent:um-hum|user:up in years [laughter] that's good that's good	hm	1
agent:um-hum|user:are you|agent:okay i'm a walker also	uh and that my walking was a fast walk uh to get the heart rate up to an aerobic level	0
user:as i|user:and it was i was it was so much fun to watch the progress because|user:but and	uh went along when i started uh at first	0

agent:and people knew it people knew that you know this person put out this kind of print and that's what they said that's what they felt|agent:the history of newspapers were to be a hundred percent biased that's all they were were that guys opinion he owned the press and he could say what he wanted and he got politicians in office and he did everything he wanted to|agent:i listened to a program one time on uh i believe it was Larry King Live was had an old newspaper guy on there and he was saying that uh	yeah	1

agent:my career design over into the accounting and business field and uh|agent:didn't really have the interest in it so i changed my|agent:and when i got into the mathematics and science classes i was not a bad student in tho[se]- in those areas but	uh-huh	1
agent:right|user:that was needed for an engineering degree|user:was that i underestimated the amount of math	uh	0

user:but like a physician it seems like you know they can pretty much|user:like your peers you said you have to if they're going to work it you're going to have to work it too|agent:right	work whatever they need as their financial requirements fluctuate	1
user:right right|agent:but i'd of had to know it twenty years ago|user:okay	see that's yeah that's that's what i'm looking at now is you know because i'm where you were probably twenty years ago or or maybe fifteen just trying to	0
user:i know what you mean no i actually i don't but i can imagine|user:yeah|user:or too [laughter-tired]	okay	1

agent:[noise]|user:yeah i i think i think that would be the ideal situation i think that|agent:um kind of regretful i think	a lot of people like in my case i i do shift work	0
agent:and so it was kind of like they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses this relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends or something you know so it was really sad just you know that a lot of families|user:uh-huh|agent:they like when i worked on second shift um their paren[t]- their kids go to school during the day and then they wouldn't see them at night because they would be in you know at work and the kids are going to be in bed	yeah	1
agent:not really uh|agent:do you think s[ome]- the the parents spend quality time with their kids are do you think it's more like watching TV and stuff like that|agent:um	i yeah i i think that i think very few spend quality time i think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff stuff like that	0
user:of course be able to teach them right from wrong i hope i hope to be able to spend|user:um i i hope to|agent:what kind of things do you hope to do	um their growing up years being in the home you know not having to work	0
agent:in my case|user:yeah but i think that's for the|agent:i hope that happens	the few and far between i think that uh	0
user:yeah i i see it seems like that's that's a big trend you know in the last|agent:huh i well i don't even think we [laughter-had] i don't even remember them being around when we were little|agent:huh	ten years day cares have have have popped up and become	0
user:[laughter] touch yes|agent:oh yeah in fact most of the world liked them back then whether you did or not|agent:um	well when i moved here in the uh mid seventies um are you in Dallas	0
agent:the best tight end in football is now their coach [laughter]|user:um-hum|agent:well they've had some very good players and fact uh	eighty nine	0
agent:yeah|agent:[noise]|user:it seemed like it's up to about ten to twelve years ago i mean all the sports including football it used to seem uh before the higher ticket prices in terms of just not for fans but i mean what	what the salaries some of the players were getting	1
user:who is he who um the guy the young guy from uh Ohio State i think he's already over the hill isn't he|agent:[vocalized-noise] it|agent:hum	oh i can't remember	0
agent:yeah|user:yeah and there's some technical stuff you know this Minicam stuff these instant replay things that uh|agent:now then there's a lot of dirty stuff going on on the line that the [vocalized-noise] that the referees don't call things get out of hand	i'm not sure that i would agree with some of it	0
agent:yeah|user:either the coach or somebody protesting|user:usually when that happens and i mean it always seems to go the way of the ref's call though it never seems to go the way of you know	um	1
user:it's um|user:there you go yeah|agent:domestic engineering right right	i don't know i just really had to laugh today i mean the what the subject was when i placed this call when the subject was football because_1 uh we had just	0
user:uh-huh|agent:well no i think it's mainly the offense the defense is better than the offense really the the|agent:yeah	in terms of running yeah	1
agent:oh well uh when they were little we did lots of reading and playing and going to parks and things of that sort and|user:tell me what are some of the things that you did with your children when they were growing up|user:yes	um-hum	1
agent:oh that's great|user:and so we would drive up to see that when w[e]- whenever it was reasonably close but|agent:oh wonderful	we did a lot of things um and we tried to do things both together and individually with the children um	0
agent:ah yes|agent:um-hum|user:uh as as they've gotten older when they were younger we would go to the beach but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things and that there would be a a feature each day	whether it would be going to one summer we uh we went up to New England and we went to the	0
agent:around for a few more hours|user:um-hum|agent:well it loo[k]- w[ell]- the one trend i would say is that with so many more women choosing professional careers there are fewer of them home in the afternoons and i don't think it needs to be the mothers but i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be	yeah when they [vocalized-noise] you know it was funny i can remember and my mother and i have talked about it	0
user:bothering them or they were concerned about and it was uh|user:because it was something that was|agent:right	you just felt gee if i weren't here	0

user:and so we've got a lot of houses|agent:um-hum|user:but it stimulated a lot of the builders to start building fancy homes	within a a few miles of us that are	0
user:because they built them and put all this money into|agent:yeah oh really|user:are not selling	them and nobody's interested in buying	1

agent:um-hum|user:although uh i what i saw was at the end of the first quarter i think he only had like [eightch/eight] eight points|agent:oh okay	at the end of the first quarter they thought that was big news	1
user:anybody who was old as that playing that well|agent:um-hum|user:but uh when they had uh Akeem	you know i just kind of had to go with them then i kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players	0
user:uh each one you know individually at their spot|user:and uh yet the Lakers continue to win so you're right i think they do really play much better as a team than they do uh|agent:uh-huh	but uh	1
user:yeah|agent:it really gets you know the i mean they're sleeping in different bed every night and|agent:so	yeah	1
agent:i figured|user:[laughter-yeah] really [laughter]|agent:yeah and they don't wear any pads so i	[noise] some of those guys got pretty f[unny]- funny looking uh eye wear	1
user:uh you know six ten|user:they were all like uh like six eight and|agent:uh-huh	and they were standing in water that was like six foot	0
agent:um-hum|agent:yeah|user:that's a that's a [laughter-lot] that's a lot of a lot of guy coming down on you	jeez	1
user:i i don't know i haven't i didn't go down there last year|agent:um-hum|user:you know and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the Mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage both the good and the bad	but uh it it was only like a couple dollars to get in and it was really kind of interesting	1
user:right|agent:Utah Portland Boston and Detroit|user:i can't remember them_1 all now	yeah	1
user:you know i i'd like to see them_1 back up there again|agent:um-hum|user:i tell you what those guys really hang tough	they really uh	0
user:so|agent:well and uh we felt the same way he was an institution and how how could they do that|user:i say that i support them there's been just so much that's happened to that team since they got rid of Tom Landry that was just like you know blasphemy around here [laughter]	yeah	1
user:uh-huh|user:yeah|agent:and then we had Jerry Glanville who is guess is now in Atlanta and now we get the guy who was the University of Houston	uh-huh	1
user:[laughter]|user:yeah yeah|user:uh-huh uh-huh	[laughter]	0
user:uh-huh|agent:it seems like though uh it seems like all my teams always you know that i that are local to me wherever i live from when my husband was in college you know you just never on a given day they could do anything and then on another day but they the consistency just when it really gets down to the championship or or the really meaningful uh game|agent:so	right	1
user:yeah|agent:so you have the teams that stay up on top for several years and then they start|user:yeah yeah and	right i think and it's a sad thing to say but i think it really depends on how much money i[t]- you know m[oney]- it always comes back to money everything does	0
agent:well this should be uh we did pretty well last year so i'm thinking this ought to this ought to be a good year for us so well h[ave]- have you been involved at all in this new World Football League i haven't watched the first thing|user:they'll eventually be a contender so|user:so we'll see as i said i really think that they'll eventually	yeah yeah it's	1
user:uh i you know as much as i love it i would think that i would sit down and watch it but it just as i said for some reason it's like oh they you know they're just out there playing around they don't uh|user:yeah yeah i mean you know you see you can definitely get involved in it more when it's somebody that you've supported all along and it's someone local because you've got all the press you know you read more about them of course and and hear more about them on on television and and such but|user:yeah	they don't really they don't really count	1
agent:i think his was it his little finger or his thumb i forget toward the last couple of games of the season so he was out|user:you know|agent:well Warren Moon broke his	yeah	0
agent:and played in one game you know we made some play-offs or something toward the end it seems like and this guy came in|user:uh-huh|agent:because we had the guy the i forget the guy's name the one who came in for him	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:football hardly in her life and she sat there with me and i was explaining some of it to her and she was getting really excited and that was so neat yeah|user:uh-huh	[laughter] uh-huh	1
agent:which is a shame but that's uh way people are|user:yeah you know it's like wh[y]-|user:yeah	uh-huh	1
user:um|agent:yeah|user:playing such a a softy	i tend to uh i like the lighter movies myself	1
agent:uh-huh|user:we're kind of uh uh we look at the movies and we say yeah we're going to go and see them go and we probably don't usually end up until|user:but no i didn't see that one i didn't um	until they come out on in tape	1
agent:[laughter-no]|user:you didn't see Two Thousand and One|agent:see i haven't seen many of those but i do like them_1 i mean	oh that was that was excellent	0
agent:i liked the first one best i think|user:[noise] [laughter] yeah i like him i like|agent:[laughter] yeah i've seen all those those are pretty good	they're usually yes the the first movie out is usually the best one and then they try and do other sequels some of the sequels	1
user:actually not|user:what's out there now|user:uh	there isn't much of anything really	1
agent:it was pretty it was pretty neat|agent:but uh they came back and their lives were different after that and all this it was|user:[laughter]	yes so	0
agent:i've never even seen any of those part one or zero or ten|user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter-yeah]	yeah i don't like that but that getting back to that theatre you got	1
agent:what was that Flashback or something like that Total Recall|agent:oh um|user:oh the Terminator where he came back from the future	hum	0
agent:right|agent:uh-huh|agent:[noise]	and my opinion is that uh the [noise] biggest changes uh probably are about two	0
user:thing that i want to talk about is which of the the changes that you can think of|user:another uh|user:[noise] well uh	are the most significant	1
agent:within even within the the accounting practice|agent:uh|agent:uh there's you know there's still some stereotypes	wh[at]- and even within women	1
user:well i'll tell you what worries me a little bit about uh|agent:you know the movement of women into into the political arena as being very important uh|agent:and uh you know i- s[ee]- i see uh	the role of women these days and i'm hoping that that's going to be a change and i don't know if you see it or not my husband doesn't always	0
agent:that you can ha[ve]- you know women can have all things you you just can't have them all at once [noise] and uh i think that's you know that's the case for men [vocalized-noise] you know for the most part too|agent:and i think that's uh you know that's the way that uh|user:uh-huh	yes and	1
user:uh-huh|agent:boat somewhere out in the Caribbean with you know with some|agent:congressman's not going to have her picture taken on a	um-hum	1
user:bye|agent:okay thank you you too|agent:yeah it's been nice talking to you too	[noise]	1

agent:well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings and they used to have a program called T News and just updates of of different things that were going on within TI well when all the the mess with uh|agent:uh they used to have|agent:i noticed that one thing that that TI did you know they had uh	uh-huh	1
agent:yes|user:wasn't home i'm a college teacher and sometimes i teach in the evening so i'll miss the evening news and uh you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on CNN i think that's|user:uh which was a big disappointment i used to watch that was my if i	that really has changed the way um i look at the news	1
user:i uh|user:and uh because uh i i don't drive that much i only live about a mile from where i go to school and work|user:yeah i find i read very little i don't even get a regular newspaper	i find i spend so little time in the ra[dio]- in the car that i don't really listen to the radio	0
agent:uh well no in in DC area|user:oh really in Baltimore|agent:i have two kids over there	uh-huh	1
user:yeah that's i i like it i like it a little bit better too it's interesting though um to meet different populations i i'm just now|agent:oh no i'd i'd rather have Baltimore with the home town atmosphere|user:you know it there's really uh most people have relocated to the Washington area [laughter] you know	being uh from Pittsburgh originally i'm just now meeting different populations like Chinese students and things	0
user:uh-huh|agent:crime problems that they're having there|agent:well most of what they're talking about in Washington is is the	yeah they in fact they just it was just a big thing recently they've had some terrible problems with Hispanics	0
user:i guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the District of Columbia at Washington and then she left that to get a position with the Democratic party and now she ran for mayor so she's uh fiscally she's pretty tight|user:this position she was a state auditor|user:something like a [noise] uh state auditor or something like that before	and uh	0
agent:uh well now i i think he carpools because he's got fairly regular hours since he came back|user:yeah well they might be car pooling too do they car pool in are they driven by themselves|agent:yeah it's means they have to drive a little bit but	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:well i thank you for calling i have enjoyed it i really do like this program because i get to talk to people from all over the United States yeah|user:well i guess we should stop now	oh good	1
user:yeah|agent:more against gun control than pro i think probably|agent:uh	i guess i would pick a five i'm not quite sure i	0
agent:access you almost have to go like to an indoor range or something to to be able for your children to learn gun safety|user:no|agent:[noise] this isn't just really great hunting country [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] you know there's not a lot of	right	1
agent:that to me is the other end of the coin that's hiding your head in the sand|user:yeah|agent:you know ooh you know i i i don't go for that you know i	oh yeah and i i	1
agent:how do they get access to that kind of thing you know where|user:you know a teenager you know below eighteen or whatever the age should be|agent:that's right	right	0
agent:militarily sophisticated types of weapon[s]- mercenary type things is what i think of|agent:that they're just replete with advertisements for these really uh|user:oh yeah	i know it's	0
agent:not even available you know they've been built up so much around it's no longer|user:yeah|agent:area uh um out off one fifty seven and you know those are just [es/extinct] extinct now	well my m[y]-	0
agent:[noise] [laughter]|agent:oh|user:and he would just look over everyone's shoulder and say hey your your gun's not unloaded you know you have to unload because_1 you walk out there	uh in this particular range uh uh in Fort Worth now the other ranges it's always somebody else but	0
agent:<b_aside> [vocalized-noise] <e_aside>|user:should we have and then it'll slowly change it's going to take twenty five years or so|user:for the next ten or twenty years you know what kind of gun uh not controls gun uh legislature	maybe to get the the the the guns into a controlled atmosphere where	0
agent:when i was when i was very young unfortunately a a little bit too young to really appreciate|user:oh that's neat|agent:so we we traveled all over Europe	uh-huh	1
user:oh uh-huh|user:uh-huh|agent:uh but we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip we had to have like eleven people for this package uh deal	yeah	1
user:uh-huh|agent:well my husband and i both like water so any any vacation that we go on is usually involves close to the ocean or or something like that|user:uh	it's got to be the water	1
user:just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and and just really|agent:uh-huh|user:the New Jersey area too because the [noise] the lakes were really pretty close you know you could you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and	and then we weren't too for from the Appalachian Trail we did quite a bit of hiking	0
agent:yeah it's a it's a little more difficult planning a vacation when you have have children|agent:yeah|user:we had little children all the time so some of the things are not as quite as uh	adaptable	0
agent:um|user:Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate|user:uh	from uh with his Master's degree in	0
agent:uh-huh|user:where you could stop and sleep maybe you know like a a|user:we we've tra[veled]- we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile	small camper we've	0
user:yeah|agent:you know not be settled anywhere just see see the rest of the country|user:yeah	yeah i think it	1
user:or Mississippi or Alabama|user:in Georgia or Florida|user:there are a lot of neat neat places to visit in America that's for sure we've i haven't been much to the south i haven't been in	i guess that's those are the only states i have not visited	0
user:we we read Bruce Catton's book before we went you know and|user:uh had about three kids then i think but that was a really fun interesting trip i|agent:uh-huh	so we were ready to look up the places we read about	0
user:a change|agent:as long as i have a a shower nearby i'm fine [laughter] and electricity|user:yeah i find the outdoors very relaxing and you know kind of	yeah [laughter] well i'm with you [laughter-i] [laughter-need] my creature comforts too	0
agent:uh-huh|user:yeah well it costs uh so much in taxes here|agent:they just didn't like what was going on	and uh even if they do give money to the poorer school districts i don't think it's going to lower my taxes at all	1
agent:and i don't know what y[ou]-|user:uh-huh|user:right	well we need qualified teachers no matter whether they're teaching in the inner city or the suburbs	1
agent:uh-huh|user:well the good school districts here do have honors programs|agent:you know i would send a child there	uh they do encourage that among the students who are uh prepared to go to college	0
agent:yeah twelve years and you add more than one child to that and you say oh my goodness|user:so you're you're talking about uh college uh level fees here|user:and that doesn't include their personal expense	sure	0
agent:uh-huh|user:i can relate to part of that uh in in my high school uh|user:no	say just for for example in my math courses uh i i was not to brag about this at all i was so far ahead of everybody else that i didn't have to go to class	1
agent:and they probably would shoot me if they heard that and i know a lot of teachers|user:i i believe in that|agent:i don't know i think of two or three things in my mind i think teachers should be tested	[laughter]	1
user:okay|agent:[noise]	do you vote regular	1
agent:yeah yeah and Democrats usually are su[pportive]- more supportive of public|user:okay and you vote for the Democrats or|agent:you know the issues are	usually okay	1
agent:yeah well|user:to pick the right person|agent:yep	so that's what they need well	1
agent:you don't|agent:just|user:okay i don't remember anything about Dukakis	but	1
agent:and but you get you know it all depends again on whose writing it and who they're for because they can slant that too|user:right|agent:what [noise] if some of the newspaper articles or the i don't trust TV as much but newspaper articles can show wheth[er]- how they voted in the past	right and like i said most of the poli[ticians]- the politicians i'm the	0
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:oh i know if enough people think like that it you know would make a difference if people stopped thinking like that	um	1
agent:yeah|user:a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking not that i think he was good looking but|agent:uh-huh	he was young	0
agent:unless they've done something really horrible you know or something real abnormal|agent:you know and i that's very true i i think that doesn't really have that much to do with um|user:yeah	well	0
agent:did you i always liked him i thought he was great at the time and i i just couldn't get over the fact that Reagan beat him i you know that|user:i thought Carter was good too and that was|agent:but he actually all right [laughter-this] i thought he was great [laughter]	yeah	1
agent:okay_1|user:it's uh Robert Townsend movie|agent:who who was in that	um i i don't know all the actors or anything but it was just it was a lot of music a lot of old songs things like that	1

agent:uh you go to a pla[ce]- after you die you go to a place called Judgment City|agent:uh|agent:anyway the ba[sis]- the premise of the story is that uh	oh i know what you're talking about	1
user:w[ell]- it's not a late movie|user:one of my favorite movies it's not one that i've haven't seen i|agent:um	it's uh	0
agent:yeah that's|user:and i liked the woman that played in that i forgot what her name is now|agent:but uh	Anne Archer	1
agent:what i've seen|user:yeah|agent:i haven't seen a whole lot either but [noise] i know i'm drawing a blank on	um-hum	1
agent:yeah the problem is you always have to wait until they're out|agent:ea[t]- eat for thirty dollars|user:it's almost more fun really yeah it's almost more fun really to rent movies you know just kind of stay at home maybe	yeah that's true too	1
agent:that was pretty good|user:no i never did|user:it's	was that Arnold Schwarzenegger	0
user:uh near to where i live and they were saying that some of the patients there you can't leave by themselves because_1 they'll make a weapon out of anything|agent:um-hum|user:it was pretty scary because i was visiting a VA Hospital	you know out of a piece of paper they can kill somebody you know	0
user:oh very good|agent:to see it in a little while here but it's been out for a while|user:um-hum	oh yeah oh yeah	1
agent:speaking of that i think Terminator 2 is supposed to be out|user:yeah it is i i d[on't]- i don't like that a lot i don't watch a lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger or anything like that either|agent:because it's a macho movie	yeah yeah that might be good though	0
user:um-hum|agent:i haven't heard much lately i just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews|agent:i haven't	yeah a friend of mine saw it and she said it was okay	0
user:yeah|agent:and uh they have F FX 2 out|user:um-hum	yeah yeah	1
agent:you see the same story lines different characters and|user:um-hum|agent:that's probably true i i i just	um-hum yeah exactly	1
agent:recognize some trends there|agent:see if if we don't uh|user:oh	okay okay	1
agent:uh-huh uh-huh Whitmire is is she still the|agent:yes|user:you do yeah we we do in Houston too	yeah	1
agent:um-hum um-hum|user:been pushed out|user:as far as in the local like our [vocalized-noise] our our our our chief of police is a woman our our mayor is a woman our s[uperintendent]- superintendent of of schools was a woman she's just now you know	but i don't know if you would consider that a trend or not	1
user:i'm not sure what the name maybe it was another woman|agent:uh-huh uh-huh|user:and they just she just lost out to someone from the Dallas area like assistants somebody who's an ass[istant]- one of the assistants in your	so	1
user:seem to be women it would be nice to have|user:yeah but but then again you know it would be nice to have more you know the majority of teachers|user:so	but the problem is the pay scale probably it's because	0
agent:part-time part-time money|agent:you know|user:uh	uh-huh	1
agent:you know generated|user:uh-huh|agent:and not just private enterprise	which i think is something that has to happen in order to	1
agent:um-hum um-hum|user:but you're you're finally getting to the point where it's just kind of second nature to find some place to to throw it|user:because in the past you know it seemed like i can remember people just just throw it down they don't care	uh [vocalized-noise] can you remember driving down the highway i could as a kid you know you just	0
agent:i agree for it to and to be adopted and funded|user:so|agent:yes yes	yeah	1
agent:he he added something to the team but uh i think they need to let him go maybe|agent:i i think without uh Roy Tarpley they're|user:but	yeah	1
agent:that uh he he sometimes ends up being a one man team|agent:i you know like i said i like Isaiah Thomas but i think sometimes that uh|agent:um-hum	yeah	1
agent:i think sometimes but i'm glad he's playing in the in the pros|agent:uh name him with some of the very top players|agent:uh it's it's hard to	yeah he's uh	0
user:but it seems that|user:i don't know if it's mainly because of him|user:seems like uh	he plays for top teams	0
user:uh well i'm from Indiana|agent:yeah|user:oh do i have a favorite team	so i like the Pacers	1
agent:yeah|user:and uh|agent:yeah	even then once they got him they didn't make the play-offs for a couple years they had to gradually build up a supporting cast because you can't just win with one player in the NBA you have to have a	0
user:uh well|user:well they made a couple trades th[is]- this year that|agent:so i i guess that's [laughter]	Fat Lever was hurt most of the year	0
user:yeah i think uh|agent:yeah that's [laughter-true] that's true|user:get know who he is	like you said i mean Tarpley if he was	0
agent:one loss to the play-off|agent:they uh i think they were one off|agent:and uh	oh	1
agent:i think if if any of these boys want to do it they really can if that's really their dream|user:oh yeah he's|agent:[vocalized-noise] he's he really goes for it and he's a good little player you know so	yeah	1
agent:Lake Ontario is right near here|agent:yeah actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me we actu[ally]- uh we have the those little the the the Great Lakes you know Grea[t]- uh|user:are there many lakes up there	uh-huh	1

agent:right we the one thing that uh we did decide as it's it's not uh we wanted it to be as authentic as possible but we did break down and put a CD player in it [laughter] that's not quite authentic but at any rate that that was one thing that i one of the features that i did want|agent:yeah|agent:yeah yeah	[laughter]	0
agent:yeah i would that that there's i see a marked improvement you know|agent:yeah right yeah|agent:really	oh yeah	1

agent:yeah|user:they say ruins the whole batch and|user:problems that uh some of the recycling centers are having because of the slick magazine pages in with the newspaper which	uh uh	0
user:uh-huh|user:right|agent:with arrows uh and that indicates it can be recycled but there are different grades of plastic and that's probably what you're talking about sometimes some of those plastics cannot be reused in certain ways some can now even our grocery stores here we have two different large chains that	recollecting the the plastic bags yeah we	1

agent:uh you know there's n[o]- no restrictions whatsoever on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that which|agent:i know it there is it's very easy to get uh|agent:and	uh-huh	1
agent:right|user:but i but i don't but i know it's not a end all and be all that's the problem i have with it in Texas|user:right in that particular instance um	they think it's an end all and be all they think that if they electrocute or slip or do something e[lse]- gas somebody	0
agent:so it's|agent:uh|user:sure	how would how is the situation in there in terms of crime and	0
user:oh i did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class and i just|user:yeah i just don't think that uh you can rehabilitate i mean i just don't uh|agent:pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and with a smile on their face as they did it	the subject i remember we drew things out of a hat and it was something uh just it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment and	0
agent:amazingly it's like uh Massachusetts went back and reinstated capital punishment oh maybe six or seven years ago|agent:i think yeah there's more that don't have it but|user:it's more that don't have it isn't that correct	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:oh you're down there in Texas oh okay|agent:i'm from Louisville Kentucky but i'm here in Texas	um	0

user:it's uh|agent:well that would be nice yeah|user:uh	it's getting away from that now i mean the town's growing bigger as as all towns are	1
user:yeah how about uh bond issues or referendum that they they put on|agent:what's real i guess|agent:you don't know	you don't	1

user:and they|agent:uh-huh|user:that way they don't get in there because some of these guys have been in there like for twenty years	they kind of run things the way they want to run them whether whether it's uh	0
user:uh|user:oh the [vocalized-noise] like uh|agent:well i want to know about politics in particular you know just you know what the workings of it is	parliamentary procedure and and that sort of thing	1
user:the running of|user:um i don't even think running t[o]- to|user:there's too many special interest groups now that are in there that that can sway an election one way or another	the government now is done by the the president they say you know he's i think he's only really a figurehead he only can	0
agent:what did you think of that whole mess with Ollie North and all that|user:well|user:no one's held accountable anymore for things that happen	oh i think that	0
agent:yeah shortly after|agent:or|user:well shortly there after yeah	yeah so there was some collusion in there i guess	1
user:you know|agent:uh-huh|user:yeah because you because it might give you uh an insight	uh you have to vote i've always i've always voted i even though sometimes it's hard to choose between whose running	1
user:tuition if it's|agent:right|user:well i have a lot of them but i don't use them very much though [laughter] i use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes uh	you know if i'm short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can	0
user:but uh i you really do need to be very|agent:right|user:helpful plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes	um	1
user:going in the deep end and|user:uh|user:but uh it's true you have to be very careful or you end up	uh and an	0
agent:[laughter]|user:well i'm not that uh other than that i don't have too much on credit cards but|user:so	it's good to talk to you	1
agent:hm|user:yeah see now i'd never get my wife to be able to follow that before we got married i had money in the bank i owned my own home|agent:it keeps us hopping [laughter]	i put in so much money each you know month towards long term savings you know like in uh mutual funds and things you know	0
agent:out of her paycheck each week|agent:yeah [laughter] so what we do is we take money out of her|user:yeah so does mine [laughter]	uh-huh	1
agent:right exactly so you know that but that to her is sort of a waste but|user:yeah but you need a hobby|user:um-hum	yeah that's true yeah	1
user:yeah|user:yeah|agent:[vocalized-noise] always soft [vocalized-noise] you know uh so so that's helpful	yeah but i i think um	0
agent:right my God|agent:eventually right i mean you're not|user:you know yeah by fi[ve]- by four fifths you know if if if she's here	so it's it's actually tough this year but it'll be better in June she'll be move live together in June so hopefully our budget will in increase then	1
agent:[laughter]|user:i don't i don't argue with her but i just get all i guess i i it must show on my face|agent:um	you know must be like [noise] like must be cringes or something you know	0
agent:you know we managed do it that way|user:yeah|user:um-hum	yeah see i i was when i had when i was living alone and i had my own house and things uh you know i put one i was paid twice a month one paycheck went into savings and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage	0
agent:still not all of it they don't get you know and that|user:yeah|agent:we went and lived with friends you know this and that and and then the whole ice storm cost us still quite a bit of money even though insurance picked up some of it	um-hum	1
agent:um-hum|user:i don't know a little more development in the area of respect as well i don't know if women in higher positions are necessarily given the same respect|user:that can be	as men	1
agent:i don't know the understanding that that daughters should go on for a college degree uh had they been sons uh you know that would have been expected but for daughters it wasn't as necessary um and see i don't think that's so true anymore i think people expect both daughters and sons to have whatever opportunities are available|agent:th[e]- the uh|user:yeah	sure oh yeah	1
user:had the uh had three sisters and one brother|agent:um-hum|user:well my mother i my parents are older because my siblings are all older i'm the youngest of older siblings and my mother um was	um so she had two sisters and one brother in any case um	1
user:um-hum|agent:somewhat uh less uh technical jobs or y[ou]- you know too perhaps uh you know start working their way up but i don't think it's quite as um|agent:until they work their way up and i don't think very many young men are ask to do that although perhaps they are asked to do	um-hum	1
user:but y[ou]- it's it's i've always heard i- i don't know if you know this joke it's uh it talks about um this this|agent:um|user:um-hum	child and his parents were in a car and there was a car accident	0
agent:well i don't have yeah r[ight]- right i i suppose my feeling is that it doesn't matter male or female uh at least they if they're given the same opportunity then that's good although they can't always th[ere]- there are certainly differences of men and women the i guess the other thing that was asked in this to for us to discuss was um what kind of changes this has brought about or what do we see in the future and uh just because this Sund[ay]- past Sunday was Mother's Day of course there was some articles in the newspaper about the uh mothers in the work force|user:um i i don't know if i necessarily agree with that but i [vocalized-noise] i don't think i agree with the Army but that's a whole different topic|agent:yeah	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|user:um-hum|user:um	right	0
user:right|user:yeah|agent:oh yeah it it's very difficult so that needs to be done and ed[ucation]- perhaps education will eventually do it but uh the idea that that all those uh things that were traditionally thought to be the housewife when she was home as a housewife are still hers even if she's out working uh you know that's a serious problem uh	um-hum	1
agent:guitar lessons and does a lot of uh professional playing you know for weekends and so on|user:oh|agent:is a musician so he does uh was uh	um-hum	1
user:[laughter]|agent:no [laughter] been playing on my computer|user:did i interrupt your reading schedule	oh oh	1
user:and so uh and our furniture is stored somewhere else so i've had a lot of time i've read a lot of books|agent:um-hum|user:well uh i'm at a stand still right now but uh um we haven't lived in Charlotte very long	but and this is uh one group of books i'm wondering if you've read	0
agent:hm|user:uh uh Plains of Passage|agent:um-hum	but uh	1
agent:yeah with the leper|user:yes i have|agent:Power that Preserves and have you ever read those by Donaldson	yes	1
agent:it's kind of what i've been studying in school and stuff|user:uh-huh|agent:and artificial intelligence	are you uh working or you a student	1
user:and so they needed someone to uh|agent:um-hum|user:and they really needed he's an accountant also	uh	0
user:that you can find|agent:uh-huh|user:as good at troubleshooting as anybody	but	0
user:one of also one of the best books that i've ever read|user:and i believe that it's|agent:hm	and there is a series of them	0
user:and|agent:uh-huh|user:or somewhere like that	and i said well let me have them first and go through them and see which ones i want to read and sh[e]- they said well sure take them all	0
agent:bye|user:okay|agent:all right i'll remember that all right	good-bye	1
user:so i mean in that kind of situation|agent:right|user:um like my husband works and i do so i don't take some of i have certain things that i take and he has other things he takes	it's really almost redundant	0
agent:uh-huh|user:uh-huh that's see that's probably why because_1 Cana[dian]- Canada has the the um government run health care systems social medicine|agent:yeah actually they're from Canada they're Canada based	and you don't pay them_1 and if you live there it's like Europe you don't pay a dime	0
agent:yeah|user:the kind of people that can't sit in the airline airplane chair you know|agent:right	you know who's going to croak first the people that smoke or you know	0
agent:and they have the 401K and the usual benefits like that uh|user:oh my goodness|agent:to[tally]- totally vested	uh-huh	1
user:but i i don't know i think everywhere they just need to uh sit down and hire|user:u[m]- not EDS TI um|agent:uh-huh	some uh [vocalized-noise] people	0
agent:uh-huh|user:they uh the health the h[ealth]- the health program|user:and the other thing i think is really good is that EDS is much better than TI at i think right now that that we have day care um	like TI has Texans	0
agent:oh i see|user:and like EDS reimburses you for adoption|user:so i don't know i guess it's just where they um	and TI doesn't have anything like that	0
user:oh j[ust]-|agent:uh price of homes has went up dr[astically]- drastically like an average house is now a hundred thirty thousand|agent:and homes that are	yeah exactly	1
agent:no [laughter]|user:um-hum and that doesn't doesn't make it any better it's just i guess something you have to keep telling yourself you know that um|agent:somehow we're better off than a lot of them_1	that's what i want	0
agent:right|user:right yeah that's a good word for it um|agent:empowerment issue [noise]	how is TI in that mode	1
agent:yeah|user:they're better but they're a little bit too um stiff collared in terms of you know what you want to do they're pretty much put the if that's where the widget goes stick it in the hole you know|user:EDS is oh	they're kind of formula oriented	1
user:i think news today um|agent:right|agent:right	it's kind of losing its importance like on in in on radio if you hear any news at all it's like two seconds	0
user:or i don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news|agent:right|user:i usually don't intentionally although i should i don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news	if it comes on i just happen to hear it	1
agent:like Headline News if you listen to it for an hour when you|agent:tends to get|user:yeah	is it is it pretty good coverage on there i mean	0
agent:and only in the morning i guess there's a little bit|agent:yeah|user:news is is pretty much nonexistent they'll have little little teeny weeny news breaks you know	yeah yeah basically	1
user:i think it would be nonex[istent]- pretty [laughter-much] nonexistent except maybe through the paper|user:you know how|user:i'm wondering where it's going	uh i know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news	0
user:i know in Dallas you can probably get two two all news radio stations|user:well just because i'm i'm thinking that it it's getting so short on radio just you you still you have two or three|user:i don't	out of i don't know how many popular radio stations and then on television you have just the news at six and ten	1
user:yeah|agent:and it's it's informative it's a lot more informative than you know a quick half hour news show that|user:um-hum um-hum	yeah	1
user:could tell us so all we had to sit here and and ask is well what aren't they telling us|agent:right|user:yeah because_1 even though we do get the story right away they were censored as to what they	you know so that that was pretty scary but we i talked to one woman and	1
agent:and you just tune it out because it's the same thing but|user:yeah|agent:like i say turn on Headline News and it'll play [laughter-over] and over	and then too a lot of times	1

user:and he used to paint um|user:yeah|agent:that's great that he has a lot of hobbies and stuff	a long time ago but i think he's stopped pretty much now	1
user:but it's it's not one of my favorite things especially from the vapors and|user:oh yeah sometimes|agent:[vocalized-noise] does he ever uh refinish furniture or anything like that	we had uh an entertainment center we did last year	1
user:and uh|agent:uh-huh|user:and the people at the unfinished store recommended it that's called a it's Z A R	it spreads real evenly and it doesn't dry too fast so it's if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out	1
agent:have a good day now|user:well it was nice talking to you|agent:anyway it was nice talking to you Dudley	okay you too	0
agent:[laughter]|user:yes|agent:came out even	oh well it sounds like really sounds like you do wonderful things uh in fact	0

user:two or three games both uh during the seasons|user:maybe got into uh|user:and	for a minute or two	1

user:yes|agent:oh that sounds great you know i used to read to them and now my two oldest can read to me every so often and that's really been fun too that they read to me|user:so it was just really wonderful so	there was an experiment here well i don't guess it was an experiment it was just a project	0
agent:and they say when you don't watch TV as much [vocalized-noise] you're more creative and and imaginative in your own mind of games to play and things to do|agent:yeah|user:so	well of course	1
agent:i say dollar theater i think they're actually two dollars these days [laughter]|agent:something or maybe rent the video although i prefer the dollar theater because_1 it is kind of fun and|agent:so we uh a lot of times will just kind of hold on until it comes to a dollar theater or	right [vocalized-noise] there's been inflation all the way along	1
agent:um-hum um-hum|user:especially to kids and i have had to hope that they would enforce the R ratings and not let kids under eighteen in|user:i just think are uh unconscionable to be shown on	[noise] excuse me	1
user:so the two|agent:yeah yeah|user:or educational [laughter-or] [laughter-something]	re[cent]- recent films that we have seen where i've been able to drag them along um are the uh Henry the Fifth the Kenneth Bronoff	0

agent:um-hum|user:so they're really crisp and|user:and they get these absolutely terrific prints that are from the uh film archives in Los Angeles that have ju[st]- been specially restored and sometimes they are made from the original negatives so they're really crisp and good	good like they were when they first came out	1
agent:absolutely absolutely and and these lawyers i get so made at them because they|agent:[laughter-right] [laughter]|user:tortured or beaten into uh giving his confession	no	1
user:um-hum|agent:oh ten months my goodness|user:he's uh ten months	yeah he's getting to be a big boy really	1

agent:yes yes that's dumb|agent:i wouldn't either|user:well i'm in favor of spending money on a strong defense but not of wasting it and some of the things that we do uh like have three different kinds of incompatible computer equipment for the three services it's just dumb	there's no reason why we shouldn't have somebody take a look at uh all of the things that the various services use and make them_1 interchangeable	1

agent:you talk to them and you talk to like the big aircraft companies and all they say well if they didn't spend the money and they didn't then they're overruns and if it didn't cost a hundred dollars for a hammer|user:in some ways i just don't|agent:and	um-hum	1

agent:bye-bye|user:okay bye|agent:take care	[noise]	1
agent:so it|user:changing it such that that|user:yeah i think trial by jury is very good i actually they said i think the tape said something about changing uh	or leaving sentencing up to the judge only i think that's actually good idea	1
user:right|agent:and everything|user:right	or just you know there are two people who say well he just looks guilty um	1
agent:does it have to be unanimous|user:can't decide for hours unless they convince that one person you know|user:one person thinks that that they're not guilty and they	i believe it does have to be unanimous actually	1
agent:yeah|user:yeah|agent:to you know just say he's guilty so we can get out of here and go home	yeah	0
user:yeah i often wonder about that i wonder if|agent:yeah bec[ause]-|user:right and they can't do anything about it	if maybe you know i- i- i don't i don't i don't know the law on that but if they have new evidence can they can they tr[y]- retry or can they you know bring you back	1
user:you can't uh|user:for instance you can't um|user:yeah well well there's also the issue of	very often you can't um	1
agent:capable of lesser [noise] assaults like that and stuff|user:right|agent:well you're allowed to show their character do you know what i mean and if it shows that their character's you know	then right then then	1
agent:yeah|user:that's true that's true i often i mean that that like you say that's another discussion but i have had|agent:they won't say yes and they won't say no to just certain issues just because they don't know what the public wants or the public's split on it	that discussion before as well where	0
user:because he was he was on some sort of news special though he was|user:i'm not sure if they had one yet but i'm sure they will um|agent:well did they have a T V movie about him	he was uh	1
user:and|agent:i think my sister is married to a guy from Rochester|user:eleven and twelve women at least	oh really	0
user:right i mean i don't know what you do with them at that point if you're that crazy but what what struck me is you know they had a psychiatrist testifying for hours and hours|user:and should just be locked up for life|agent:well of course but they need to do something with him he needs to be annihilated [laughter]	and by the end i realized that you know maybe it would have been better if they had	0
agent:yeah|user:i mean that opens a lot of questions that i don't have any answers [laughter-for]|user:for some really strong gun control measures but	it's like i'd i'd like to see a lot of controls	0
user:i'm not sure that those people would be able to get a hold of the guns|user:b[e]- be able to find a way to get the guns but i think in a lot of domestic [vocalized-noise] uh disputes and a lot of family disputes um|agent:um-hum	you know in other words a a family that has a history say of physical abuse or physical violence but isn't the kind of family that's involved in criminal activities if if there were gun controls and that there just were not guns accessible to that type of family	1
user:uh-huh|agent:and uh you know with my wife and daughter|user:you have	oh my goodness	1
user:no i'm really i'm so much of pacifist that|user:but yeah that's the that is the thing see as [vocalized-noise] in the past say five years i've evolved from thinking|agent:uh	i would have to find another way to deal with the situation or	0
agent:you know because_1 we've been through a lot of the the court battles and all this other stuff over the years because_1 they're behind bars now but|user:yeah|user:just i don't think that's it will i'm sure	yeah	1
agent:[noise]|user:holy smoke that's wild i was ta[lking]- again i was talking with somebody just last week and a[bout]- about crime in general i guess it's been on the news a lot lately and i g[uess]- must be in the back of everybody's mind but i was saying|agent:whether it be just normal robbery or whatever	if people around here think if they just get a better security system and a higher fence that you know they're going to take care of themselves and i said there's it's going to come to a point it	0
user:they weren't yeah|agent:and you know they they physically were not harmed in any way they were very lucky|agent:yeah	um-hum	1
user:yeah yeah|agent:but that's his normal style i mean that that's what he would do in a in a confronted situation|user:yeah	yeah if he could	0
user:um-hum|user:um-hum|agent:out of cold blood the chances are they would do it again because they feel no remorse	gosh	1
user:molesters that have molested several children over and over again|user:that uh have raped several times or child|user:they're taking criminals who are repeat offenders and i mean really repeat offenders	and they have put them in i don't even think they call it a poli[ce]- a a prison	0
user:that's right|user:no|agent:i and that and and i hate to say that but i- i mean it's it's just you they they violate your family of course at that point you don't have much to lose and i ha[te]- and i- like i said i really hate to say that but i think that i would be that uh	that's right	1
user:right|agent:to help themselves some they have by being extra careful|user:um-hum	right	1
agent:um-hum|agent:right|user:don't seem to be able to produce the students that ind[eed]- indeed many uh manufacturing and other enterprises want they can't seem to they can't seem to read properly do math properly	and conform to what employers want	0
agent:i[t]- it's amazing i have a friend who's an e[lementary]- who's an elementary school teacher and she said that they recently|agent:our elementary grades um|agent:i have similar views that's you know where	yeah	1
agent:yeah by the time they get there they can't read the[y]- they they can't read anything|user:oh so you're close to the subject|agent:yeah an[d]- and they can't	and yet you know i have grandchildren i have ten uh nine grandchildren uh in various parts of the country	0
agent:you know what the parents are going to be like when they come in and the responses the parents will give back oh yeah|user:yeah|agent:you know give or take eighty ninety percent	no kidding oh i- i- i yeah i guess i could i can understand that	0
user:and i guess you got to take them away from the tube also another thing that i have another|agent:yeah|agent:um-hum	problem i have is	0
agent:and they were winning|user:right right right|user:right	yeah	1
agent:because when Georgetown was number one their their their m[oney]- money that was donated to them from companies from from l[ocal]- from business people from graduates whatever was up into you know like twenty million dollars and now it's down to like fourteen million|user:really i|agent:right right but see the sports brings in the money	well i guess they're	0
user:yeah|user:yeah|user:no	yeah	1
user:right|agent:and but he's was trying to make it in the sprinter's event and most of them are under twenty five|user:right	well	1
user:yeah|user:yeah|agent:before i would continue the agony	that's [laughter-right] [laughter]	1
agent:huh well what brought you guys down to Texas then|user:it's a lot colder too so|user:it just it's a lot cleaner up there but um	uh his job he came back to start work again for a different company so	1
agent:uh the people down here typically don't think it gets above you know fifty degrees [laughter]|agent:up there and if you kind of interesting|agent:so i'm uh quite familiar with how it is	[laughter] this is very true	1
agent:yeah me neither [noise]|user:the greenhouse i[s]- i don't really [laughter-know]|user:um so i don't know what's happening if it's you know we are	it just [noise] you know	0
user:recycled and a truck comes around uh|user:regime in which uh bottles and newspapers are|user:has just uh put in a city wide recycling uh	once every couple of weeks and they separate your bottles for you and your newspapers and uh	0
user:uh a central location in the city and then do all the separation yourself|user:so they've made it uh they've made it convenient it used to be if you wanted to recycle you had to drive to a|agent:wow	and a lot of people didn't do it just because the recycling location was so unpleasant	0
user:you know just for the the sake of argument here|user:but uh it it it sounds let's see you you may you said one thing that uh uh|user:yeah	um	0
agent:you know they provide the bags didn't you say that|agent:that the government there in Raleigh i mean they've|agent:uh	they pro[vide]- well they provide these big plastic uh boxes actually	0
user:sort of uh high tech uh|agent:huh|user:and have the various bins for the re[cyclable]- various colored glasses and a bin for the plastic and a place for the newspaper and they're kind of these high	uh uh trash collector trucks they're big things too they must be as long as at least as long as a school bus	1
agent:uh-huh|user:costs about twenty five or thirty percent of what recycled newsprint costs so|user:one of the problems with newsprint especially is that virgin newsprint	a newspaper company is not is not going to buy recycled newsprint when virgin newsprint is available at a third of the cost	1
agent:hum|agent:uh-huh|user:now i'm just guessing but i bet you that that's an accurate guess	and	1
agent:what about oil recycling oil|agent:price difference there|agent:you know i didn't know there was such a	well the the um	0
user:do they have options on who they|user:uh-huh|agent:providing that plan	uh you know like choices of doctors and that type of thing	1
agent:anything with him|user:uh-huh|agent:with your doctor that you can feel free to discuss	uh-huh	1
user:if you couldn't change or|user:and that that something like that you know i thought|agent:yes and the expense of that yes	look elsewhere	1
agent:and uh|user:uh-huh|agent:but those guidelines have to be set up and i think they should be voted on by the public	for them to have a choice on	0
agent:eye care and uh [noise] our body as a whole should be included in that because|user:uh-huh|agent:uh included in all of that uh dental	uh	1
agent:and does he have an option|user:that the company has selected|user:if they take the doctor that the	he get	1
agent:under doctor's care that's for sure|agent:it's quite different from when i was uh|user:what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take	uh-huh [vocalized-noise]	1
agent:i'm a former Michiganian so|agent:okay so|user:yes uh-huh	oh uh-huh that's a nice state	1

agent:uh-huh|user:i can't remember the name it's it's on the Oklahoma Arkansas border|user:Arkansas	and it won't take but just a you know just a quick look at a map to find where those mountains are but i took a drive up through there as a matter of fact last September just took the drive through to see what was there	0
agent:and then try to tread back [laughter]|user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	0
agent:so we didn't do much outdoors stuff except swimming|user:uh-huh|agent:i don't know but we just didn't get out my mother and my father split up when we were young so and my mother wasn't into that and that's who i stayed with	uh-huh	1

agent:um-hum|user:i made a vow that when i had kids no matter what they did i was going to be there you know|user:but at least i'm really making the most of the time while they're little and um everything Taylor even attempts to do you know we go and watch her and and support her and that was something my parents weren't able to do and i resented that because i would be in i was always in plays in high school and in all kinds of drama and they could never come and watch me and that just it was so hard for me so	and see them do it so	0
agent:and i wished that she could have been home more it would have been greater because she was|user:yeah|agent:but uh it really was really was a special	yeah	1
agent:right|user:but um the fr[iends]- the friends that i've kept in contact with from you know when i did work and they're still working moms you know|agent:right	uh that	0

agent:but uh|agent:you can just spot them_1 because the cei[ling]- the roof is so high much higher|agent:again it's not typical in this area	well i hadn't thought about it in that sense	0
user:if it's the kind of river i'm thinking of better them than than us you know|agent:which is kind [laughter-of] [laughter-nice]|agent:but of course they have a little river going down their area too	are you talking about a real river creek	1
user:i'm more accustomed to|user:in fact i have been real disappointed in the six years that i've lived out here about lot sizes|user:uh	a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being	1
user:by that|user:hemmed in|user:i just feel	it's not as comfortable a living	1
user:when i first came out here in|user:sort of what drove me to Denton|user:the one that's	eighty five	0
user:oh well|agent:i got laid off by TI [laughter]|user:you all both you all both work downtown	this is a wonderful thing that y[ou]- that you're doing here still helping them out	1
agent:work those hours or|agent:but do they uh determine your benefits on whether or not you do|user:um i have been	yeah you like you have to work twelve hundred hours um within a year to get holiday pay and	0
agent:you were going to get more of a profit sharing or you know or just you know|agent:if you knew that uh long term the|agent:lower salary or hourly wage	right yeah	1
agent:you know the best good was not gleaned from the [laughter-money] [laughter-spent]|agent:and uh well i mean i guess you can't ever totally say that but|user:yeah really	right yeah	1
agent:but uh|user:yeah|agent:to get anything	does that just supplement like Medic[are]- Medicare or	1
agent:um-hum|user:well the last three days it's been pretty rainy we went to the beach|agent:how's the weather been out there	and uh it started uh let's see around	0
agent:the radar just looked nasty|user:hum|agent:over i think it was over the weekend	uh-huh	1
agent:is the temperature like sixty sixty to eighties there too or|agent:um-hum|user:it's finally cleared up it's just now st[ill]- still a little overcast but the s[un]- but the sun has finally started popping out	oh yeah well right now as a matter of fact i'm fixing to go play tennis it's um i'd say it's at least seventy nine eighty well about seventy eight seventy nine degrees	1
agent:um well uh Richardson's a suburb of Dallas|user:how f[ar]- how far are you from Houston|agent:-[de]pends on how strong the cold fronts are	oh i see so you so you don't ha[ve]- you don't get anything off the Gulf uh immediately from from the ocean	1
user:so the the beaches here just get really beat up uh|user:yeah and they're still uh [noise] rebuilding from that storm|agent:wiped everything out	and it usually comes this way [laughter]	0
user:you know go downstairs or go into the bedroo[m]- bathroom|user:[laughter-so] of course that woke everybody up and we knew what was going on to uh|agent:huh	and uh take cover	0
agent:under an underpass and it was tossing around the car|agent:kind of chased them_1 it was a few hundred yards away and it chased them|agent:um they took a bunch of film of it it it uh	oh gosh	1
user:and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground|agent:yeah|agent:uh	but otherwise we'd just sit back there and watch them_1 go in and out of those clouds	1
agent:um-hum|user:and the lightning was almost continuous just uh you know as if you put your hand on one of those electric uh things that causes lightning|agent:yeah	uh i think it was called the storm	0
agent:vegetable garden and i'm from Chicago and the way that uh b[ug]- bugs and weeds grow down here is very [laughter-different] [laughter-from] [laughter-Chicago] and we have tried several years in a row and we've given up between the fire ants the pill bugs the|agent:well we've tried having let me turn the TV off we've tried having uh|user:well what kind of garden do you have	[laughter]	1
user:so|agent:oh boy that's frustrating|agent:uh-huh	but yeah it it's interesting and i enjoy gardening my son does the mowing of the grass	1
agent:it really does the job but it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here and|user:um-hum|agent:and installed that and um that's really what makes the most sense because_1 you don't have to use so much water and	[laughter]	1
user:sure|agent:yeah yeah|user:oh sure	well it sounds like you you've got your hands full [laughter]	1
user:uh i i've been thinking about the fact that the uh Gramm-Rudman Act that was eventua[lly]- originally passed uh to s[atisfy]- to s[atisfy]- satisfy some of these deficiencies and place a|agent:oh really|user:well i've had a a little bit longer to think here because uh they waited about ten calls before they found you Bob but	set of handcuffs on Congress just doesn't work because now we do things outside the Gramm-Rudman	0
agent:and one of the bases that's being closed or that's on the you know on the agenda to be closed is Carswell Air Force base in Fort Worth which is right you know right close by|user:yes|agent:and uh Dick Armey is Congressman from Texas is one of the the sponsors of the the uh bill that's that called for the closing of military bases	yes	1
agent:yeah|user:i mean i don't know it just seems to me we'd almost have to change the way we do business in government if we didn't have special interest groups i mean right down to the state and city levels and so on but|user:oh i guess we'd almost have to	i was wondering about	0
user:yeah|user:state tax|user:yes	yeah yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:you know i- i think that uh you know i think we're just going to have to [laughter] as as Gerald Ford said we're going to have to bite the bullet and uh uh and|user:that i don't know if there is any short term or long terms steps without a greater crisis that takes place	but how do you get people to do that though i mean i- i- i- i- i don't even find myself you know i see i- i play that game with myself sometimes	0
agent:um-hum|agent:right|user:as long as you continue to buy in your country more than you continue to sell you'll have a trade deficit and until that comes under control uh the lending comes under control that that's your problem well i mean i- i started to laugh at that i mean it seems so simplistic but	i guess it is the truth we just keep [laughter-buying] [laughter-this] [laughter-stuff]	0
user:okay Pat can you tell me uh|user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	wha[t]- actually they want what everyday occurrences are	1

agent:uh well we will be glad i will be glad to give you some of ours [laughter] usually we get it in in great quantities in April and May|user:we could use a little more rain|user:uh-huh	i believe	1
agent:um are you in an agricultural area|user:[noise] well not too many miles|user:the weather forecast has missed us the the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us just by	yes um-hum	0
user:uh-huh yeah well and that makes it bad too because uh when more with water|user:uh-huh|agent:they they really do and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered	being at a premium	0
user:oh|agent:[noise] um what is your hum[idity]- humidity like|user:a bit of a difference too	i don't know i think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in Texas	0
agent:um-hum|user:he's just in an area where it is just low enough that it's you know it it collects there|user:and uh	and uh he has had a couple of inches in his house several times	1
user:right|agent:to warm places during the winter and you go to cold cool places that well i go to cool places during the summer if i can anyway|agent:i hope you visited during the winter one of my one of my theories is that you always go	right that is the best time to go yeah an[d]- and usually it has been when we have gone it has been nice it has been hot but it is it is hot to me in the wintertime down there	1
agent:and uh she is five years younger than me she is more wrinkled|user:uh-huh|agent:but you you know it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot now my sister is a a sun fiend	is that right	0
user:uh|user:soaking rain and|agent:good	it's just been a really nice Spring	1
user:[laughter]|agent:i'm sure i will in in fact if i hadn't been preparing for this the out of town visitors i probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple of days|user:good luck in your this venture it is uh like i said it has been real interesting so i hope you enjoy it as much as i have been [laughter-enjoying] [laughter-it]	yeah i forget to the day goes by and i forget to make a call usually [laughter]	1
user:and then i start wanting something|user:uh i'm just do ver[y]- you know just just all depends that it when i have everything all paid off|agent:[laughter]	and i don't really have enough well don't have enough in savings s[avings]- you know like for a big purchase	0
agent:you know summarize what your balance is going to be at a particular time and i can do that|agent:your budget has to be so that you can uh|agent:um-hum	yeah and the pro[blem]- the problem is especially with young people is they they want things now they don't want to have to wait for them_1 and credit cards are the way to do that	0
agent:Neiman Marcus and things like that and i am sure that they probably would not have a problem [laughter-either]|user:no Palley Royal|agent:we have Dillard's and uh Sanger Harris and Macy's and	i know i know a lot of people who uh some ga[ls]- some ladies at work who don't have any problems with money or anything but they they really love Palley Royal	0
user:uh you have to|user:the only good thi[ng]- one good thing about credit cards though uh especially in business if you|agent:if you can heed to advice given	you know you are going to be reimbursed by your company	0
agent:and you've got to live that down|agent:and so you know that is the shame about that is uh and people won't touch you|user:oh yeah yeah	um-hum that is true	1
agent:in a in a really bad situation|agent:to me they were criminals and they used th[at]- that|agent:instead of uh	yeah	1
user:[laughter]|user:um-hum|agent:well uh i have two children so i don't have a whole lot of spare time right now one of the things that i've made time for is uh playing softball i really enjoy i enjoy softball but i enjoy all kind of sports i enjoy watching and participating	uh-huh	1
agent:so i'm i've become a garage sale shopper and it is fun on the weekends i drive around|user:yeah|agent:use them_1 and wear them_1 you know for that many years or anything	[laughter]	0
agent:so i think that'll be a lot of fun|user:right|agent:yeah because_1 my oldest daughter's in school and she gets bored real fast when she's home with nothing to do	yeah	1
agent:another thing i enjoy doing is cooking i i like especially it's real strange but i like to cook for other people like i have a friend that's uh pregnant but she can't get up and walk around right now|agent:yeah|user:yeah if it doesn't go [crite/quite] quite right	oh no	1
agent:i think it'll be real good for them [laughter] they can go fishing [laughter]|user:uh-huh|agent:yeah my uh my husband loves to fish i'm not much into fishing but uh my daughter thinks she wants to learn how to fish so	[laughter]	0
agent:was something easy i could [laughter-do]|user:yeah i remember that yeah|agent:but uh for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big uh hobby it seemed like people did them_1 a lot uh uh people don't do that much anymore so it	yeah yeah they are pretty easy	1
agent:high school and college somewhere around in there i can't quite remember the year and|agent:well i wanted to go i was in Chicago and i guess i was close to eighteen or something i- i it was like i think the summer between my uh|user:what was yeah what was you doing during Woodstock	um-hum	1
user:well|agent:and a lot of the stuff that goes on today|agent:yeah planted trees and stuff and we didn't realize you know the implications of all that then	w[ell]- growing up with	1
user:we are totally equal now|agent:just assume|user:you know women's rights uh we just	there is not really a lot to fight fo[r]- now i saw something on TV last night	0
agent:see men are coming into their own now too|agent:but it|user:yeah it really does	yeah	0
agent:[laughter]|user:and he said well he said does that mean you are going to shoot them_1 if they break a leg and|user:custody to the mama	you know butcher them_1 if they get fat he said my kids are not cattle	0
agent:mother and father have to work now|user:uh-huh|agent:oh well see that that's the spirit of the sixties and whether we are talking about the rain forests i tell you you know the situation you have right now and and all of our generations is what to do with the children because both	well uh we are trying to keep away from that my husband works for the railroad	0
user:so she had to work and|agent:uh-huh|user:and my mom had six kids	you know i was raised by my sisters and stuff and i can i can't see the difference but	0
agent:they definitely do i|user:twenty four hours a day|agent:they definitely do	do you stay home with yours	1
agent:yeah|user:or that what do they call it the nuclear family|agent:yeah	yeah but uh	1
agent:what that whole system is going to look like because that's that's our choice now too that's that's our cause|agent:and i think you know the more we try to you know shape that the more input we have into|agent:right	w[ell]- i think f[or]- i think one that would be uh	1
user:he went wild|user:oh my little boy just|agent:oh	you know i mean because	1
agent:i said we passed them on to you i mean you know because it takes a lot of hard work it takes writing letters to congressmen and|user:you you what|agent:yeah but we we gr[ew]- we passed them on to you [laughter] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-i] [laughter-mean]	we passed them on to us [laughter]	1
agent:it|user:because_1|agent:huh-uh	um we've had sort of	1
user:yeah it sounds nice|agent:um-hum|user:vacation home	um are there kids that are there too or mostly adults	1
agent:yeah|user:in Texas the rest of it is sort of a big void to me|agent:uh-huh	but uh	0
user:not quite French but uh [laughter] it was sort of a reunion before leaving it was fun it was on um|agent:yeah|user:well	New Year's Day so it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time	1
agent:[laughter-right]|user:where [laughter-nobody] lives|agent:um-hum	but at least that way it is at nobody's house so nobody one no one person is responsible for everything	1
agent:he gets|agent:so|user:um-hum	yeah i used	1
agent:the bass we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet so|agent:well he put some crappie too but|agent:put some bass in uh his pond a few years ago	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah|user:yep [laughter]|agent:oh it is probably in there just burping goldfish	we still have lots of little goldfish they propagate pretty well those little fish	0
user:um-hum|agent:yeah they live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota and up into Canada|user:but catfish do i think	so that you me[an]- well we could try it that is a good idea	0
agent:yeah that's what happens [laughter]|user:and so|agent:um-hum	but do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there	1
agent:and they're the cat[fish]- the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water|user:um-hum|agent:you can see their whiskers come through the water and	uh-huh	0
agent:yeah they get real fat|user:that's pretty big though|agent:that is only about three and a half feet long	yeah	0
agent:okay well yeah you're old enough|agent:[laughter-oh]|user:um just barely yeah i'm uh twenty nine so uh	yes but just uh	0
agent:yeah it just kind of dragged on um i don't know how you were historically but i w[as]- was a little bit older before i realized just how long it had been going on since LBJ and i mean|user:right which really wasn't the attitude with Vietnam it was sort of a president's war rather than a country's war|user:which uh	right yeah it seemed to me like it was	0
agent:yeah i mean i don't think they do but i just think it's kind of a shame that uh you still hear things about the children that are orphans there and|user:yeah i don't know if they uh i don't know if they have that resource or not|agent:you know and i don't know if it's because_1 there aren't any oil fields there [laughter]	yeah	1
agent:the money's after yeah i mean i think it started actually like like in the late fifties i mean like in fifty eight fifty nine|user:the Congress wouldn't approve you know|agent:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:DC yeah are you a native of there|user:yeah r[ight]- right near DC [noise]|agent:oh i know where that is that's beautiful where you're at	ah pretty much yep	0
user:we're probably making a comparison against uh some European and uh|user:uh|user:of our uh people are voting	and uh	0
agent:but [noise] i don't think it's difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place who or who are not just motivated who really believe that their|user:that uh if it is difficult to register to vote that would remove your eligibility to vote|agent:um-hum	well	1
user:and and put some sensational thing before the public as Mike Dukakis learned in the last campaign|user:th[an]- uh than than a positive factor and y[ou]- and you know to if you if you go on the attack|user:no the public would rather hear something negative about the other guy	and it's not refuted people will you know uh believe it if you don't refute it as he didn't	0
agent:yeah well|agent:yeah|agent:yeah yeah yeah	but i think it's	0
agent:yeah|user:[vocalized-noise] you know we had higher turnouts because at that time we [vocalized-noise] talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter right|user:but then but you know everything is relative to when uh	i mean is	0
agent:those|agent:to say that uh|agent:so that's y[ou]- you know i think that you have really hit on something there	what do you mean	1
user:uh-huh uh-huh|agent:there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the if the wife is going to actually be a mother|agent:at all i mean	that's interesting because that relates to the thing that that strikes me the most and i'm sure you've you've labeled the cause because what strikes me the most in uh the changes in society is the way kids behave	0
agent:it allows the government to subsidize her to be the mother of her children rather than to subsidize child care|user:oh that's great|agent:until it and um i'm sure until at least school age and maybe longer and what this does is	um-hum	1
user:so|user:you know nobody seemed to have a big problem with [laughter-that]|agent:um-hum	that's an interesting issue though	1
agent:um-hum|user:well no even families that don't have child care i mean you know when i think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year and i'm sure she spends at least that in clothes plus you know fast food every day and out to lunch every day|agent:i don't see how they could be especially not if they have to pay for child care	and	0
user:um-hum um-hum|agent:it's beginning i think|agent:yeah well it's it's um	i guess i haven't seen that as much in this area although every now and then you hear about it	1
user:to meet people and that|user:and that people were going basically just as you said as a social|agent:um-hum	but um it's hard to judge	1
user:the same percentage got them_1 but we didn't know it or|user:well it's just it's maybe it's more unusual now when you know somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer and in the past maybe|user:probably	i don't know	1
agent:that's good|agent:that's wonderful|user:he's always lived in the in the city and he's always been kind of independent he's uh	[noise] he's never had a a never owned an automobile never had a driver's license you know he's always	0
agent:um-hum|user:he started having mini strokes|user:about a year and a half ago he uh	[noise] and we got kind of concerned about him and then uh he had fallen in the street a couple of times but	1
user:and he had had another stroke and uh|agent:um-hum|user:my wife tried to call him and he wouldn't answer the phone so we kind of expected the worse so i went down	i found him he was just he was just standing in the middle of the room all covered with shaving cream he always trying to shave and	0
agent:um-hum|user:[noise] uh one morning he felt real dizzy so we took him to the hospital|agent:um-hum	and while he was in the hospital he had a a massive stroke	1
user:uh my wife couldn't|user:[noise]|user:um i was working during the day and and uh	she she couldn't get him up	1
user:and we started looking around and they said no|agent:right|user:because we couldn't take care of him	the first nursing home that's closest to you that has an available bed is where he's going to go	1
agent:oh|user:you get them_1 in uh you do what you have to do for them_1 and that's it|agent:right	um	1
agent:well then you did see some compassion from the people there|user:i guess|user:which was a surprise to us you know we didn't realize that they had	uh but most of the people were	1
agent:uh-huh uh-huh|user:my wife spent so much time there|user:but i think only because	she was there i mean every single day during the week and then on weekends we would go in the both of us	1
agent:yeah ye[ah]- so he kind of adopted you and your wife|agent:um-hum so he ki[nd]-|user:but he was young enough where they gave him therapy and he was beginning to move up but he could talk and [laughter] [laughter-tell] [laughter-us] things oh you want to see what they're doing here and do you want to see this but don't tell anybody you know [laughter]	yeah	0
agent:of course yes|user:um i hope that i never get into that situation where|agent:um	you know the kids will say well okay dad you know here you go	0
agent:okay how did it influence them|user:a couple|agent:okay	uh	0
agent:he was a Vietnam war veteran|agent:he was uh|user:right	yeah	1
agent:of southeast Asians it has affected the culture of this country|agent:uh not so much that i say i do not want you here but there is just such a surge|user:yeah	oh yeah	1
user:because_1 i know there's there's still people even in the Dallas area|agent:i know that they're|user:well they are probably not doing very well at all	there are there are still people trying to get some member of their family back	1
agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum|user:and all they did is run and hide and they weren't really fighting you know it it would've been the same as Desert Storm if all they had been fighting was North Vietnam	but and i am not even sure	0
user:well now even i think even now in in Vietnam they could probably have done a better job|agent:um-hum um-hum|agent:that's right	because they could [noise] they could kill all those plants you know which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on but	0
agent:right um-hum|user:look what happened when they were looking for Noriega and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him|agent:um-hum	you know he probably just went down into a tunnel	1
agent:on the other hand you know you can be angry about something for a very long time or you can say well that is the way it is and go on with your life|agent:but i sure can't blame them for being angry|user:um-hum	right	1
agent:i really i don't know i[t]- we should not have maybe gotten involved but if we did we certainly should have supported our people who were there|user:um-hum|agent:there there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world	yeah	1
agent:well do you watch much TV|agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	well i watch in the evening with my kids	1
agent:right|user:and the Cosby Show is uh is uh kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money|agent:okay	i think that sometimes the things they show on there though uh the problems that their kids get into are	0
agent:uh-huh|user:that he that he becomes|user:how the how he has to help with the people	um	0
agent:i do not like him glued to the TV all the time|agent:but other than that|user:uh-huh	well i do not think it's it's healthy all the time either	0
agent:Masters Of The Universe the movie|user:the cartoon or the|agent:and they have got the He Man uh	oh uh-huh	1
agent:they do not have any kids but they was told how to use that but still when the kids get older they learn how to break through that parental control|agent:and uh|user:uh-huh	oh do they [laughter]	0
user:uh now i like uh everything Mi[chael]- oh no not Michael Douglas um|agent:[noise] uh-huh|agent:no	oh i can't think of his name	1
agent:because there is not a lot of shows that do that|user:yeah|user:uh-huh	i	1
agent:teach him stuff from the Bible and i think it is just a real cute show i'm trying to get my little boy into reading uh like church books and things|user:[laughter]|agent:a dot [laughter] but it is real cute and like i say they they	uh-huh	1
agent:whether or not you know a lot of it is uh when they're in school and you know their after school thing you'd hope that they would have time for studying but most of the time they don't they just play|agent:um|agent:yeah uh i suppose uh d[epends]- it depends on what kind of program they have especially for summer summer programs	yeah	1
user:one parent doesn't work a part of the time|user:who have kids you know uh|user:i wonder actually i wonder about costs because_1 most people i know who	you know only works part time and takes care of the kid part time and then	0
user:yeah i don't i don't you know i just yeah it it just strange because people do i mean in that sense it probably is pretty good to go out and just|agent:i don't know|agent:so i would say maybe you know a day or two a week to get out to go do something else not necessarily go back to work or something but	who cares if it if if all your salary goes to pay somebody	0
agent:oh really|user:and the little boy and i all went out and had you know a a b[oy's]- a boys' night out|user:so we pitched a tent in the dark yard actually and his father and	in the back yard and about quarter of one he woke up half crying and he couldn't sleep and this and that i mean w[e]- we wanted to bring him inside [laughter]	0
user:um they're four to seven actually there's one at i work mostly with four to seven and then eight to twelve i i'm i'm the class [vocalized-noise] so i|agent:oh what age|agent:oh	i help out in this class and uh	1
user:he keeps them moving quick enough that you know|user:he does lots of you know he's he's he's fast moving with them they'll do this exercise they'll do that they'll do this they'll do that|user:wonderful with kids and he seems to know how to hold their attention you know he keeps them	when they stop losing attention they start	0
user:uh there are um more boys than girls but there are a number of|user:it it it it's mixed there are|agent:is that right	number of girls in there who actually uh	0
user:it seems to me that uh that i don't know whether the jury system uh i i shouldn't say i don't know i don't feel very|agent:[noise]|user:[noise] well uh	uh stronger that the jury system should be changed it seems to have worked uh uh time immemorial	0
agent:[noise]|user:there's always uh there's there's always a jury that might be [laughter-swayed]|user:uh	uh by the moment uh to either be too lenient or	0
agent:right|user:uh waving the normal uh procedures and the eighteen years will uh translate into something like uh four point seven if every if the if the prisoner is a model prisoner|user:uh uh uh uh uh	and indeed the present overcrowding conditions uh	0
user:yeah i guess we always focus on criminal trials with with the jury but|agent:th[ey]- they give the person the option for a jury|user:yeah well i guess we do	i know you have a right to ask for a jury in in any sort of a case that even where damages are	0
agent:anyways the deterrent|agent:i can't think of the word i'm looking for|agent:the the purpose of getting people in jail so that you know the the	yes	1
user:i imagine there's a certain certain right of the press to have|agent:right|agent:huh	the ability to ask that but i	0
agent:yeah|agent:one one count|user:i think they only f[ound]- uh found him guilty on one count which was uh not even which was a class something felony which was not even punishable	uh uh to the degree that they thought it but i don't know maybe when you're there in the r[oom]- in the courtroom yourself and you're sitting there and you've got to make a judgment on somebody	0

agent:you know anybody that does not have a a criminal background or you know any any real reason to not allow them to have one i think that anybody that wants one should be able to buy one|agent:are reasons for having a waiting period that uh i think that anybody that|agent:you know so i you know i can see that there are	um-hum	1

agent:so i am kind of at this point [laughter] getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year probably through the Fall too|agent:half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted or the plants do not make the winter time and|agent:and i have since then probably ripped out	um-hum	1
agent:nuke the lawn [laughter-with] chemicals|agent:Howard Garrett organic enthusiasts or a Neil Sperry|agent:but back to gardening are you one of these uh	if i can just nuke it i'd do it but i do not i just	1
agent:um-hum|user:the lea[f]- when the blooms died the leaves were just horrible looking|user:and i	so i just	0
agent:no i have probably have done hyacinths but i have just learned wi[th]- with doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming because_1 they do not take the heat here|user:of hyacinths|agent:um maybe six hundred bulbs	oh of everything	1
user:they get uh|user:that is what they call them_1 down here|agent:they call them_1 flags	just one bloom	1

agent:okay|user:i'm in the Air Force and so|agent:are you in the Air Force	people outside the Air Force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do	0
user:uh-huh|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:went to New Orleans for four days and came back late last night driving it's about seven hours um and that's a very we had never been there that's a very very neat town to visit uh in terms of the French Quarter and all of the things you hear about but the crime is so bad [laughter-there] i mean in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do how to carry your wallet um	right	1
agent:i came downstairs and i was real upset and i probably got more nasty [laughter] than i should have but i just said Howard|user:[vocalized-noise]|user:right	[laughter]	1

user:quality restaurants um|user:well i think we're very fortunate because um in the past twenty years Washington has really developed a a good number of|agent:well where what what's good in Washington DC to eat	mostly although you have your normal continental we've gotten the exc[ellent]- excellent ethnic restaurants um	0
agent:uh well no it's French actually|user:uh-huh is it continental|agent:i mean on the West Coast i think there's only like four in the US but	i[t]- it is French uh-huh	1
agent:[laughter]|user:[noise] uh-huh uh-huh|agent:and and would not order unless i had never had it before	well we're very fortunate we have we have two sons and ever since they were e[ven]- even very little they we very adventuresome i mean they tried frogs legs an	0
user:uh-huh uh-huh|user:and|agent:oh i know i know i- i used to live back in North Carolina and i remember going to up to to Richmond James River and we'd get [vocalized-noise] and and flounder you don't we don't get flounder out here on the West Coast	oh i know but you get some other kinds of fish that are just wonderful i know that you have abalone out there	1
user:the owners of which|user:besides the little ethnic things you've got your great seafood places and there's one great German restaurant there called Hausners|user:there are mostly um	um traveled all over the world and this place is room after room of art so that you feel you're in a museum except it's completely over done	0
user:and uh other things that they don't produce in you know in quality but other as[pect]- other Chinese restaurants you would eat other things so uh|agent:sure|user:where you only eat certain things	we we do tend to eat out at least once a week sometimes more although with two sons in college now that may be it may be a [laughter-little] [laughter-less]	1
agent:it's in you know it's just just down from the from um University of California Berkeley and uh and it's [laughter] and tha[t]- that's what's good about it is that th[e]- th[e]- th[e]- the prices are extremely reasonable and the competition is so keen that the food really is good so you know you|user:oh well how tempting|agent:uh	um-hum	1
agent:o[ne]- one more time what was the name of that restaurant in Baltimore the German|user:and very tasty meals and uh|user:uh even the some of the areas in Washi[ngton]- you can get very reasonable	Hausners	1
user:uh which is unusual for northeast Texas|agent:um-hum|agent:yeah	generally we have some	1
agent:well it's pre[tty]- Spring usually starts uh in May|user:well uh typically though what does your weather run when does your Spring actually start|user:um-hum i can imagine	um-hum	1
agent:uh|agent:oh i guess not that's you don't have as much humidity though do you|user:and i didn't know whether we would survive at all oh but	well actually you know we affect our humidity a great deal this at one time wasn't a real humid area	0
user:ri[ght]- yeah|agent:snow two you know uh three to five inches all the time or q[uite]- quite often they seem to be able to handle it when they have it like that but|user:right	oh yeah	1
agent:right|agent:[laughter] okay [laughter]|user:year before last they took a [laughter-snow] day because it was flooding [laughter] uh Spring flood and they just couldn't get to school so they just canceled school	so there's just too many we're in a a very uh they're low hills	0
agent:no i don't either [laughter-i] [laughter-know] [laughter-what] [laughter-you] [laughter-mean] [laughter-because] electric bills go up and [laughter] in fact uh i was at my daughter's on Sunday and they had their first brown out uh it just electricity just went off for about twenty minutes and then came back on|user:i really don't want that [laughter]|agent:yeah	oh	1
user:s[ome]- some of the|agent:oh i know the remote control was a great big box that was connected to the back of the TV|user:i guess over the last ten to twenty years or maybe the technological advances you know ten to twenty years ago there wasn't a VCR in every home and there wasn't uh	[laughter]	1
user:so that that has changed people are uh|user:no no never got around as it were but i uh i paid attention to it all being there|agent:did you go to like Woodstock and all that	i think the	0
agent:well how old are your kids|user:it's uh it's kind of sad|agent:h[ow]-	i've got a nine year old and a seven year old	0
agent:child abuse wasn't as bad as it is now either|agent:and [noise] this|user:um-hum	right	1
agent:yeah that is because|user:[noise] it's an interesting change in attitudes|user:they uh they're so outspoken on the topic that uh	there's coming coming along with the education	1
user:it's i don't know of any other major changes other than the political environment course that things are|user:well i guess there's uh|user:yeah it keeps going up and up	no longer the cold war scares and the things that are going on that realm and Russia's no longer the major enemy and	1
user:so that's an|user:uh that whole defense issue is just not quite as important to people's lives|user:so now that Russia's gone as a major focused on enemy	an interesting social change i guess	0
agent:like in AutoCAD i don't do those but we have that capability here|user:um-hum|agent:i don't do any plotting though i don't do any you know i don't do any uh device creations or anything like that	oh okay	1
user:games and and for entertainment games|user:for their educational|user:to use uh	and i soon discovered that it was running faster than the IBM PCAT that i had purchased to do my uh uh	1
user:and i've got to make a lot of improvements and uh improve my models and|agent:um-hum|user:and uh it's it's just now up and running in that mode	adjust coefficients and try to improve the performance a little bit	1
user:talking to MIT and uh Bobrank and [vocalized-noise]|agent:um-hum|user:talking to uh different groups i spent uh three or four days in Boston earlier this year	and a place named Sonotek	0
user:and there'll probably some be some very good systems available|agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum	by the turn of the century	1
user:uh my interest is in extracting the understanding|agent:um-hum|user:word recognition or something resembling word recognition	and in developing uh man machine dialogue type operations	0
user:teachers ordinarily use during the day they they're teaching a grade stool grade school student to|user:well it's it's all of parallels techniques that|agent:that's wonderful	add and subtract they	0
agent:okay well uh what's your opinion about capital punishment|user:[noise]	well Cathy i think that uh capital punishment certainly	1
user:uh do we say that|agent:right|user:um what i don't know is where do we draw the line	everyone who commits murder in the first degree	0
user:the cultures that we grew up in and what's|user:yes it does uh a lot of that has to do with|agent:yeah it's gets into a pretty sticky issues	termed acceptable and and uh	1
user:a|user:is a|user:civil liberties of purs[uit]- life liberty and pursuit of happiness then taking that away	heinous act	1
agent:yeah|user:involves the taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life|user:that	such as rape	1
user:than|agent:right|user:for food	a person who	1
agent:right|user:uh the loss of life|user:instead of	[noise]	1
agent:[laughter]|user:and i don't think that i saw it in him until maybe last year uh|user:you know i i have an eighteen year old and uh i[t]- well he's nineteen now	and i have an el[even]- and eleven year old and a nine year old and i don't	0
user:uh-huh|agent:uh recently but hopefully the job that i will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations|user:uh-huh	yeah [laughter]	0
agent:first of all health benefits because_1 it's more important with a family and you know our doctor's vi[sits]- routine doctor's visits covered my health insurance only covers um|agent:is|agent:and um so one thing that i'm very concerned with now	right	1
agent:and so the insurance would cost lower|agent:so i think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there|user:uh	uh well	1
agent:because it would be really nice to be able to have|user:yes uh-huh|agent:so i was pretty shocked at that but the other thing that i'm really concerned about and most companies don't have some are starting to have is day care	[noise]	1
user:oh|agent:life insurance and uh retirement plans but [laughter]|user:um-hum	i don't know i think those benefits you men[tioned]- mentioned sometimes they're even more important than you the wage itself	0
agent:and you're less preoccupied with it i think|user:yeah|user:right	right yeah	1
agent:and if you get two weeks off you get two weeks off and you're not allowed two weeks and one day|agent:right|user:they say you're going to do it this way and that's the way it's going to be yeah	um-hum	1
agent:and you know times are rough now so it's new it's harder to get|user:uh-huh|user:uh oh	uh-huh	1
user:no|agent:okay is uh that a sport you like to participate in [laughter]|agent:[noise]	actually i'm a spectator and i'm a second hand spectator as a result of my first husband's or my la[te]- late husband's interest in golf	1
agent:yeah|user:but golf was one that i|user:golf tended to be s[o]- i am not really deeply involved in any following any of the sports	developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers	1
agent:uh-huh|user:i decided Andy Bean was good [laughter-competition] any time they both played why he was just real excited when Tom was you know|user:interested in him so	shown on the television and	0
agent:oh really [laughter] i sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated and mad at themselves [laughter] when they don't do well|agent:[laughter]|user:and i know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier	[laughter]	1
agent:yeah|user:a[nd]- uh anything can be warped|user:but it is a good healthy wholesome lifestyle	but i think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to to move into maturity	1
user:um-hum|agent:oh yeah no my husband's pretty tolerant so he's not too bad to watch [laughter]|agent:[laughter]	oh mine had a very short fuse if he did something bad he's liable to take that club and throw it as far as he can throw it	0
user:well the one thing that is a is a drawback about it|user:[laughter]|user:um-hum	i think is the cost	1
agent:yeah at least you're just com[peting]- you're competing against yourself i guess more than|user:maybe golf is a forgiving sport i don't know|user:so i am not an athlete	it doesn't appear to be [laughter]	1
agent:Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of [laughter] lawn and garden|agent:and uh but grew up in uh|user:[laughter-okay]	<b_aside> hi <e_aside>	1

agent:yeah yeah|user:that's one of the hazards i guess of uh having a a yard|user:and i really hate to lose them_1 but um	because i	1
agent:uh u[p]- up until then they do[n't]- hadn't been big enough but what i just|agent:the last one that we lost a a year ago|agent:now th[e]- the one that the one that we lost	um-hum	1

user:um but as as times changed|user:yeah well i was kind of same thing it's you know i was i was brought up in a small town and and women tended to just get married and take care of the house|agent:how about you	um the price of things	0
user:and whether it was warranted or not people just stayed together|agent:yes|user:on a family to have a divorce in it	because of what the family thought uh	1
agent:slowly but it's definitely increasing so that probably ten years from now|agent:as as the years go by they run surveys to see how many women are CEOs or on the boards of major companies and the number is creeping up very|agent:and uh	is that right you think they you think that's the case	1
user:the ones that are up there|user:uh i don't know if that's just my imagination or not but it seems to be that's uh|user:uh they have to work twice as hard it seems like to achieve the same levels that a male does	uh seem to have a little bit more intelligence than their counterparts	0
user:uh just through i guess uh uh|user:is controlled by women now|user:and also they say that the bulk of the wealth	the men dying off and just leaving their uh fortunes to women	0
user:you know it it takes uh uh it takes a stick of dynamite to get them moving off center in a lot of cases|agent:yes|user:the old Yankees	where uh	0
user:[laughter] [laughter] the|agent:uh you know it's going to get to a point i some men are going to wonder if they're falling behind [laughter]|user:uh-huh	uh	1
agent:it's real bad there has been for a few years especially on the Dallas side|user:yes uh-huh|agent:they have a lot of drug dealers over on you know where Spring Valley is and Coit	um	1
user:the only problem that we have here are are you know just very minute sort of crime we have neighborhood crime watch programs and then the|user:um|user:i guess it moves in different uh areas at different times	uh city police patrol the areas at least one a day	0
agent:yeah i never i never heard all of the story about that i just heard it from people at work and on the radio uh a little bit|user:is that right|agent:and apparently they already they already caught him or they're talking about somebody else they're talking about two million dollar bond for somebody	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah it's real bad too|user:oh oh that was Redbird|user:the guy was that over in	hm	1

agent:oh really|user:oh different places for various reasons uh i got an application from Home Depot for their card|user:uh i get uh applications for cards from	and uh the incentive there was that they'd give you ten percent off on your first purchase with that credit card	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah and it just i don't i don't really go for them_1 and i in fact i had my own before we got married and ended up cutting them_1 up just for the fact that TI had lower rates|user:nobody bothers saving any money	sure	1

user:they'll they'll i have contacted them about this and they say that well it's it's they look [vocalized-noise] they every year they look at different areas and try to determine where|user:they'll|user:i'm hoping that that soon	where uh the most houses will be and so they	0
user:okay|user:right|user:[laughter]	all right bye	1

agent:really|user:no in fact some of the days we froze|agent:was it hot	it was well we were there in the winter	0
agent:really we we found that in Jamaica it was the same way that people would come up and try and sell you well try and sell drugs and things like that but they they were so destitute and i guess they they make all their money on tourism and and they would|user:and we had nothing taken because we knew and we had things in inside pockets and in you know in jacket underneath a coat type of thing|agent:uh-huh	but	1
agent:really|agent:no|agent:well you lived in France so you've been all through Europe	hopefully we'll get to travel a little bit too	0
agent:uh-huh|user:but uh no i didn't get to the Great Barrier Reef i drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to A[delaide]- Adelaide it's gorgeous absolutely gorgeous the coastline was just incredible it's|agent:uh-huh	huge	1
agent:oh wow|user:yeah|agent:really	China was a little bit more	0
agent:uh-huh|user:getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai it's just a train ride and that i had two internal|user:uh sort of	one yeah two internal plane flights	0
user:right|agent:because you don't really even get a flavor of the country if you're yeah yeah wow|user:right	uh but yeah that was tha[t]- i highly recommend that way to go if you're ever interested in going the route i dealt with this woman her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston	0
agent:started hunting when i was twelve years old of course my parents made me take hunters safety classes and|agent:i|agent:quite a collection myself and you know i'm a good hunter and	yeah	1
user:there was a an article in the paper just this week where i think it's uh|agent:you know yeah so|user:you have got them outgunned	one of the gun companies i can't remember which was developing a ten milli[meter]- ten millimeter	1
agent:yeah|user:but it was you had to register as a gun owner you didn't have to list your guns|user:a uh it wasn't really gun control	but you had to have this card it was like a driver's license card	0
agent:especially for handguns now rifles aren't too bad but|user:yeah|agent:before you can buy any big ammunition	yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:it would definitely be gun control|agent:you know	the uh the	0
agent:yeah|user:well i know what uh i took my kids out and taught them how to shoot a g[un]- gun my wife the same thing uh she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not not that i have an arsenal or anything but we have several guns around the house|user:yeah	[noise] one of these days my grandkids probably	1
user:[noise]|user:yeah|agent:you know we'd start with the BB gun deal you know so he started with the BB gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows and i took it away from him i said now	[laughter]	1
agent:yeah i think so uh|agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:well that's about all i we agreed pretty well on this i think so	okay well it's been real nice talking with you	0
agent:good grief|user:that they have to go through about four hundred people to get a a jury [noise] for [noise] this one case|user:it's amazing the	because um there was	0
user:yes i agree|agent:yeah they are i think th[ey]- uh i think they need to stay that way|user:um aren't they supposed to be unanimous though now isn't that the way it is okay	i do [vocalized-noise] although i do not know i think that the judge should be involved i re[ally]- at this point i am not sure how it works but let's say that a jury decides somebody is guilty	1
agent:i just|user:and he goes to jail um|user:yeah	and oh it's really scary	1
agent:that's|user:yet it was it was almost a type of thing where he almost wasn't guilty because they had this little flaw|user:and um	one piece of evidence	0
agent:he was doing it entrapment i'm sorry you know|agent:i'm sorry|user:i mean [vocalized-noise] this guy is dealing drugs it's not set up he was just doing it	yeah	1
agent:a couple of years ago and my my husband was called for jury duty on that|user:um-hum|agent:well you know they had uh a big drug trial in Roanoke Virginia	[noise] really	1
agent:so they have to retry them they have to bring in a whole new jury they have to absolutely start over again|user:oh so what happens nothing|agent:yeah you know it would be split one way or another and and that ends in a mistrial	oh	1
agent:oh my gosh yeah [laughter]|agent:oh that's nice|user:off of charges of killing their wives or their ex-wives yeah isn't that lovely so there's this guy um i forget what his name is and he is a lawyer someplace and he's gotten so far about four or five men um free of the charge one guy went in stabbed his ex-wife to death because she was sleeping with another guy i mean ex-wife you know we're talking	and	0
user:uh before uh simply because the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that|user:well i've had i used to have the opinion that there wa[s]- that there really wasn't any more crime in America in the cities anyway than there was in previous centuries|user:i've	the police now had advanced uh reporting methods with computers and other devices	1
user:yeah|agent:it just really grabs your attention it just makes the whole place seem like that|user:uh there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they uh	right now	1
user:yes well i uh i have three theories about it you know three things i have one theory|user:well|agent:what do you what do you think is is causing all this because it seems that there there even though crime though though i think it is increasing in number it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity and violence too	and it's [vocalized-noise] by two things one i i believe that this is a function of uh	0
user:that that's what i think about it that's some of the things i think about it plus uh|agent:yeah i- i haven't seen that but uh yeah|user:uh per capita i mean the Saturday night special stuff so	[noise]	1
agent:yeah|agent:[laughter]|user:kind of unheard of when i was young now i do not want to sound like an old fart but [laughter] but that that's what it seems that those things happened before it didn't happen in that manner before television and i i i i have to think that	that it has some influence on it	1
user:uh there's so mu[ch]- there's so much of a return from pris[on]- to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure|user:well i mean i i guess so what i wanted to say and i stopped uh i do not know i got diverted was uh that|user:yes yes	and	0
user:i i do not know how that's i do not think it's done by uh|user:yes that's right th[at]- yeah|agent:well nobody feels responsibility to do something it's like oh boy i wish they would stop doing that [laughter-yeah]	the changes come simply by statutory nature	0
user:pretty tough law and order state but [vocalized-noise] but yet that does not seem to have effected the|user:and uh uh short business stints and it seems to me they are a pretty|user:well Texas has uh Texas has uh has always struck me i mean i i i have lived in and out of Texas both in the service and	amount of violent right in the state just citing that you know	1
user:we have five bedrooms uh two kitchens two full kitchens|user:so uh|agent:wow	uh we have	0
agent:split level house|user:that's about all but it's all split level|user:let me think	yeah	1
agent:that's a pretty big area|user:yeah|agent:really	it's it's funny because we have um	0
agent:uh-huh|user:yeah well all our walls are white you know well they are plaster|agent:we'll try that last resort if uh if the painting does not help	except for our you know in the basement the playroom and we have	0
agent:real short|user:real short|agent:is it uh is it a real short or a thick carpet	yeah	1
agent:empty out i- [noise] instead of right near the house|user:[laughter]|agent:and making sure that the rain the rain gutters from you know the roof and all	yeah	1

agent:[noise] yep	okay i i do a fair amount of cooking	1
agent:un[less]- unless it is unless it is i catch a fish and i prepare it|agent:[noise] most i cooking i do just comes out of a can|agent:and um	uh	1
agent:sesame seeds and bread crumbs|user:if you are looking for a fish recipe that was good|user:so	sesame seeds and bread crumbs	1
agent:i like that it's just it's just home cooking|user:uh-huh|agent:oh there's a restaurant called String Bean on Spring Valley and Central	yes i've been there	1
agent:green beans and mashed potatoes|agent:you know a piece of chicken and then i get like|agent:it's like a baked	um-hum	1
user:hum|agent:and the dog never you know he treated it like a milk bone and he never did finish it he barely made a dent in it|agent:gave it to the dogs	yeah	1
agent:huh|user:was just a total fiasco|agent:um-hum	um	1
user:well when i was single i used to uh i think my favorite meal was a|user:yeah|agent:mostly i just cook for myself	a baked potato	1
agent:um-hum|user:i i never really enjoyed cooking for myself so i ate very simply|user:yeah that but you know um	and i was	1
user:for a pie by uh boiling evaporated milk|user:i had this wonderful recipe and and you were supposed to make a a toffee like substance|user:and uh	three hours and it does turn to toffee inside the can	1
agent:um well the last vacation i went was to Cozumel and that was last uh March and April|user:okay where have you been on vacation lately	oh yeah	1
agent:lay on those beaches over there|agent:as y[ou]- you know as opposed to the Mexican side i want drink rum drinks and uh|user:oh really	like in the in the Virgin Islands	1
agent:um-hum|user:really|agent:now that is probably the number one place on earth that i would like to go	wow well all the pictures i've ever seen of it has just been gorgeous but	0
agent:i guess Lake Michigan and then you take the ferry over to the other side and um-hum|agent:yeah we talked about doing one of those drive around trips you know you drive around|user:yeah	oh really	0
user:oh really|agent:well Nick just got back from San Diego last night and he said it was absolutely gorgeous and i haven't been there since i guess it was seventy|user:so i don't know we'll see	uh	1
user:but i mean a trip is a trip|agent:the vacation part of it [laughter] [laughter]|user:yes [laughter]	so	1
user:really|agent:San Diego i went to a [shore/show] a show you know one of those transvestite shows|agent:oh i saw them in uh	oh yeah yeah	1
agent:like [vocalized-noise] Carswell and things of that nature|agent:tends to be uh based on a lot of a lot of that lately of course it really wreaks havoc with the economy when the government decides to shut down things like bases and and uh|agent:uh basically government funded uh research and development and you know it's tends to create jobs our our economy	right	1
user:the variables that uh that might crop up and then they've been hit with a lot of those uh|user:[vocalized-noise] i think that they th[ought]- thought that they were going to get a lot more done quickly than they then they really did they didn't think out all of the|user:and you know they take [vocalized-noise] take some	a lot of i think they've had a lot of poorer ma[nagement]- poor management here in the past uh several years no no clearly defined goals uh	0
user:so that tha[t]- you know that's been good for them they've learned a lot and they've they've made some achievements in in that respect but they['ve]- they've been|agent:right|user:you know they they've had a man in s[pace]- in space for you know a quite a long time you know in in in in the different space stations that they've had and uh	doing it very slowly and very long range you know	0
user:technological advances but|user:the process of of creating space projects you know we you know we've seen that in terms of computers and and the the myriad of different uh|user:from the from	uh like you say you have to kind of weigh that as to what is it worth in the long you know for for the overall	0
agent:um-hum|user:early sixties you know big big boom of|user:know big things like that happen i me[an]- i've you know i've i went through the entire and i grew up in that	of uh you know all those Mercury and Gemini and uh Apollo	0

agent:and uh we went in and it was the m[ost]- it was the most wonderful food|user:[laughter]|agent:i'm not eating in there [laughter] are you nuts	my word it's like mama in the back kitchen huh	0
agent:A i think C H A N D|agent:K A L|agent:so [laughter]	okay	1
agent:well that's happened before|user:unless somebody is trying to blackball them|agent:yeah	um-hum	1
user:well i can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between|user:well like um|user:well	but they ought there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious	0
agent:for one person|user:okay whi[ch]- which is kind of high for lunch i guess|user:well it was pretty reasonable i it was around ten dollars for lunch	yes	1
user:like|user:well i guess if you were having if you were trying to impress somebody|user:uh-hum	taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and	0
agent:now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken|user:it was a marinated broiled chicken breast and it was exc[ellent]-|user:well i had the i had a broiled chicken breast and it was excellent	oh it was	1
user:i|agent:that's too bad because i'm probably not going to stop eating it [laughter]|user:i- and especially uh in Wisconsin and Michigan they say don['t]- buying of our fish	[laughter]	0
agent:had a half-life of oh five years if they sit empty on dry land|agent:and storing them in tin barrels which i- i guess|user:yeah	corrode	1
agent:so i'm either going to be i'm either going to starve to death or i'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can you know|user:well you know|agent:you know this is not in my control	um-hum	1
agent:yeah|user:oh definitely any any crimes against person|agent:crimes against children is one of them	uh i feel uh	0

agent:they may or may not have been willfully intending to kill that policeman but that family still has no provider|user:yeah|agent:people who kill policemen policemen who are killed in the line of duty	well	0
user:but these individuals if they have a gun with them|agent:um-hum|user:uh aside from domestic disputes husband shooting wives or vice versa	i think that the the sentence should be even longer than if they don't	1
agent:of the process in which the criminals were apprehended i mean uh you know the guy is guilty you know he's done what he's done y[ou]- you may have stood there and seen it but because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested|agent:never actually come to trial because of|agent:well one of the sad things is that so many of these	yeah	1
user:but you have to continue uh|agent:that's right|agent:um-hum	to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty	1
agent:oh that's nice|user:um you know they don't really care about gourmet stuff but it was the guys that got together and did all this|agent:great	and um like my husband just he really really likes to cook	0

user:oh okay|agent:i work at [vocalized-noise] laboratory from uh i'm an officer in the Air Force and uh|user:how did you find out about it	i see interesting	1
user:um|agent:uh-huh|user:so uh when they chose baseball i mean i'm i'm i can understand baseball you know i don't understand football	you know uh it's such a rugged game that it uh	0
agent:well|user:and uh that doesn't please grandma too much|agent:um-hum	i'm always af[raid]- because the injuries are s[o]- uh can be very very devastating	1
agent:no i did that wrestling|user:injury with|user:did you did you sustain any permanent uh	that	1
user:you know uh my broken arm and the way my ball would do and he says let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage and so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen|user:i[n]- on our league uh noticed uh|user:and uh one of the men that was in our l[eague]-	i had my high game of two eighty seven	1
agent:sure|user:uh fellowship but uh outside of that no|user:entertainment and i	i didn't and i and i still i like to bowl but uh	1
user:uh	our children are both uh	0
agent:and uh so w[e]- you know it keeps us pretty busy as you know|user:uh-huh|agent:well we have a uh three year old and a one year old	sure it does	1
user:i guess uh what i see is so far as uh the trends uh uh for children uh i don't know what kind of a area Virginia Beach is but|user:um|agent:yeah	course uh Richardson's in the Dallas area	0
agent:for for a three year old it's that uh there's a lot of emphasis on on on on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten|user:um-hum|agent:uh the only other thing i have noticed though is that uh [noise] it seems that there's been a lot o[f]- or more empha[sis]- emphasis at least in what we've been dealing with and and uh looking you know just start not ev[en]- not really looking for a school for him but uh like a preschool or something you know where he'd go maybe a couple hours a couple days a week or something	right	1
agent:and given given that knowledge and stuff with it and he seems to enjoy it|user:hm yeah i think uh|agent:and i think it's important because i think that uh you know it gives him the interaction with the computer because_1 it sure looks like that's gonna be your you know the big thing for a long time	oh	1
user:the systems are not|user:that uh the the school systems in uh particularly in this area|user:i kind of feel like uh	under enough control the the students	0
user:but uh|agent:and uh you know that's just a problem that who knows how that's gonna that's gonna come out or anything|user:right	yeah	1
user:i|agent:as i've gotten older i've started listening more to the words of music|user:country music	uh	1
user:go with|user:uh i would probably|agent:if you had to pick one what would you choose	it's tough uh	1
user:that was a real interesting time and you know the music sort of|user:and uh|user:i'm from the era where you know we had all the rock and roll i'm forty so i'm you know part of that whole deal	made the whole time	0
user:and as far as country music is i've never really|user:um|user:but you know same	uh listened to it	0
user:it seems sad to me it's always about some guy losing some girl and then|user:country music it's about|user:well whenever they talk about uh	you know playing the guitar and singing about it [laughter]	1
user:uh|user:oh okay i i must admit that's yeah they're fantastic so|agent:the Judds certainly	uh	1
agent:very much so|user:uh how about the Oak Ridge Boys|user:um	very much okay well i like them too so i guess i've had a smattering and i just uh	0
agent:that's true|user:yeah so i mean it it it'll if it stands the test of time we'll see|agent:yeah	and uh then it'll if it survives then it'll just probably be	0
agent:and it has grown from there|agent:i think you've already stated that all music is rooted in the classics|agent:well the big key is that	well	1
agent:now i've drawn a blank|agent:the no the the test uh|user:protection	um you mean uh uh the test to oh the	0
user:um-hum|agent:self incriminating evidence course we're talking about you know criminal cases in that in that case but|agent:of [vocalized-noise] defeating some of the purposes i think of the Constitution which you know which says you know you don't have to give	right	1
user:looking at it on the surface|user:and just|user:and um i feel	um	1
user:painless way of uh|user:and|user:that they feel that this is mo[st]- the most direct way	scanning their uh employees	1
agent:you know that kind of a situation|user:um-hum|agent:and in in almost all of those cases it was you know husband and wife or boyfriend girlfriend or	a casual user of drugs or	0
agent:right|user:um [noise] illicit drugs that are around and the methods by which they're made|user:i don't have any desire to but i would be awfully fearful because of all the uh	and some of them are very deadly [noise] and it's kind of playing Russian Roulette with drugs	1
user:i wonder if uh now in their applications when they hire people|agent:uh accept this test [noise] go through this testing|agent:but to uh a[ccept]-	i know it wasn't in the application that i filled out years ago but	0
agent:you know the bourgeoisie was was was definitely out of uh style then|agent:and the the Chin[a]- the commu[nist]- the communist Chinese didn't like this at all|agent:anyway she as she grew up towards maturity her parents well her dad was a doctor and and he was rather well you know rather well to do in the old regime	right	1
agent:uh to freedom|user:um-hum|agent:so she so she went across the border to her husband and another and other child that they'd already had	oh	1
user:he chose it and uh|agent:uh-huh|user:Green Card and and uh	it's got this wonderful French actor who's	0
agent:[laughter]|user:um started investigating so they had to get back together and get their stories straight [laughter]|agent:[laughter]	and	0
user:he was so proud of himself for giving ex[amples]- all the correct answers that|user:uh they did perfectly and then he said something because his English was so poor on for the most part he|user:query or inquisition or whatever	that on the last one he said oh i never remember that answer and that clued the	0
agent:she's my baby yeah|user:oh|agent:oh no no no no she's my baby	oh	1

agent:yes it is it's just a different lifestyle yes|user:it's just different|agent:you have to look on that on the uh positive side of that	yeah it's just very different	0
agent:of teamwork and uh|user:uh-huh|agent:there's less uh friction involved in relationships when you add that skill	uh-huh	1
agent:um-hum|user:and you owe you owe that|agent:oh absolutely that's right	back to God because he's given you that ability and that talent and	0
user:we need to we need to|user:i think i'm more worried about the deficit the national deficit than than uh a lot of other people are and think that|user:i uh	either raise our taxes or or cutback on something and i don't know what to cutback on to	0
agent:because of the cost of the taxes on them i know i live in Richardson|agent:that it's precluding people from being able to own a home|user:yeah i think so	yeah	1
user:for the schools and and realizing that that that|user:moved to R[ichardson]- Richardson one of the reasons we chose it was for the uh|user:when we	that	0
agent:but all the various t[axing]- taxing authorities that come through i think the one tax i resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime|user:huh|agent:i know uh my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes i think	yeah and and even if it is isn't going to uh	0
user:uh|user:on then then the business|user:yeah and the other thing is that wh[en]- when it when it's [vocalized-noise] the public transportation is established that early	business and residential patterns	0
user:as opposed to downtown|user:office buildings and stuff that are out here in in uh north Dallas|user:for instance all the all the the uh	uh to try to	0
user:yeah|agent:yeah just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere and new York and some people don't even own a car and know how to drive a car|user:you know like New York does yeah	yeah	1
user:yep|agent:you know|user:a little bit much oh yeah	yep	0
agent:a couple of days ago and really liked that actually i saw it twice because i [laughter-liked] it so much|user:oh did you|agent:i saw Thelma and Louise	oh see that's also on my list	1
agent:and that was pretty scandalous|agent:Truth and Dare|user:oh	scandalous	1
user:how can i tell|agent:really|user:well okay see we're getting back to last year that's probably the last [laughter] movie i saw um Dances With Wolves i just adored it	you um a couple years ago i guess well maybe ten years ago i i've read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee and so	0
user:have come to respect a little bit more the uh|user:well i think so i um i|agent:i thought it was a very interesting movie	you know what went on here but	0
user:ate a lot of popcorn|user:yeah|agent:that was that was it was it was good i looked at my watch only a few times which is a good thing but it put me in a really it put me in a really bad mood i don't know why yeah we did there were three of us who went we were just all grou[chy]- really grouchy when it was over	did it really	1
agent:which is probably the best movie i've seen ever it was just wonderful it's a uh story about a little boy in a Italian|user:oh|agent:which is an Italian movie	really	1
user:all the farmers you know|agent:oh well|user:yeah we need rain really bad	well it's good for hay	0
agent:we're in central Texas and it feels like we live in Houston|agent:we got a lot of uh|agent:yeah uh i don't know where where it came from but it's been really	oh really	1
agent:and it's just causing chaos and i mean these are good these are good summer rains you know electrical storms and|user:oh|user:out of the Gulf	yeah	1
agent:hotter than usual|user:we've had real hot weather|agent:um	yeah yeah we've you know	0
agent:still the|user:yeah|agent:i wouldn't not as early as it came i mean your talking September maybe that's a little early	uh-huh yeah i was wearing shorts in March	0
agent:so but i like it here i wouldn't i wouldn't trade it for snow any day|agent:it was really hot|user:oh my gosh	huh	1
agent:you know real cold weather for long periods of time|user:yeah|agent:and all that kind of stuff and because_1 Texas is just just isn't built for	well it's real dry down there you don't have the humidity either do you	1
agent:gotten used to it|user:[laughter]|agent:other areas and i'm just a sun person i think	well i don't	0
agent:our daughters are fifteen seventeen and twenty|user:how old are they|agent:things and we tr[y]- we have dinner every night too but not everybody is always there	oh wow	1
agent:it's mainly what i you know what he wanted to do and and he's a swimmer he's a golfer|user:oh|agent:we aren't we aren't into boating either uh mainly because_1 my husband doesn't like boats that much and he uh	yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah i think that's i think that's a bridge that everybody uses to get used to taking the responsibility of caring for something and then|user:yeah yeah those are my children right now [laughter]	well it was real funny because_1 we were walking out of a store one morning and he turned to me and he said did you feed the kids this morning and i said no didn't you and this lady looked at us like we were child abusers	0
user:so|agent:yeah yeah well that's exactly how old my parents are|user:[noise] um my mother's seventy five and my dad's seventy three	oh really	1
agent:um|user:oh well see that's another thing that scares me about having kids because_1 i was the baby|user:uh-huh	so i haven't even really been around kids	1
user:yeah|user:oh yeah|agent:i think the fact that you have the boating and the camping is a good good thing i think it's hard for parents to find things to do with their kids once the sports aren't there	well	1
agent:well this is my first call so um yeah yeah i- i enjoy uh this is really going to be a neat thing i think|agent:[laughter]|user:well yeah but i just kind of keep talking until we quit [laughter]	oh really	0
agent:and a wax leaf ligustrums|user:uh-huh|agent:um we had monkey grass	uh-huh	1
user:[noise] and uh so we're trying to do is k[ill]-|agent:um-hum|user:left untended mostly for about_1 six years so there's a lot of clover growing in it and everything	to to kill back all the weeds and the clover and let so the grass can grow	0
user:and uh|user:into the landscape there|user:and uh we're also kind of looking at uh a little bit of landscaping as far as putting some uh azaleas in with uh you know different white azaleas and red azaleas and purple azaleas you know to give a little color into the	you know put a couple of plants around our deck in the back and a couple in the front with the existing plants uh to give a little color and everything	0
user:oh yeah whether you you know you put your whatever different grass clippings and all that in and and you let it sit there for a while and it kind of cooks or something a[s]- as it decomposes|agent:yeah|user:you know where you have you heard of that	and we sort of have one by guess by accident that's in our backyard and so we're thinking about using some of that to spread around you know the the the bush beds and flower beds and stuff	0
agent:i th[ink]- i think it's double-edged|user:oh i'll have to look for that i didn't know it was a separate blade|agent:that you can put on other mowers	uh-huh	1
user:oh|agent:parents have one and they live just about_1 three miles away so we use that one|agent:i don't have one in my home here my um	i see	1
agent:mostly business things uh his resume uh his uh|agent:folks house for|agent:that's part of it um my husband has used the one at his	yeah	1
agent:mine's broken at the moment but [laughter]|agent:oh i have one of those yeah|user:um and was finally able to this is oh been like fourteen years ago we moved here and i was finally able to afford a new typewriter and i got an IBM Selectric i thought i had died and gone to heaven because [laughter] i thought oh they're so wonderful well then um	yeah [laughter] ours really needs to have some work done on it but but then my husband um worked at TI and i got a um this has been years ago he doesn't work there anymore but he got a um	0
agent:yeah you had to memorize it and|user:but uh i mean like going um forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just you know didn't match with the kinds of keys you were using|agent:uh-huh	yeah and but WordPerfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways and you and it does a lot of things too that	0
agent:some day to have one here i'm they just talked to the other day other day about|agent:yeah i'm anxious|user:i- i just know right now that i couldn't have put out half of what i did if that much without the being in computers so that's been really great and uh i'm so i'm real spoiled	yeah	1
agent:and so i decided well if she's going to do that it would be a whole lot easier if she could type [laughter] so we'll slowly learn to to type here and then|user:oh great|user:right	right [laughter]	1
agent:huh|agent:[laughter]|user:most of them do now i don't have anybody that works for TI but uh	my son works for a computer company the National Institute of s[ome]-	0

agent:uh-huh|agent:they|agent:right [laughter]	and uh	1
agent:well yeah it could be bec[ause]- they don't i think it's the texture of it but it takes more chewing [laughter] and|agent:i guess|user:well maybe that's good the way way the things are going	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh uh-huh|user:uh-huh|agent:well most of the entertaining we do is church associated we have a real tiny little house we don't have room really to have people here but we do get together for wh[at]- fellowships at our church and	uh-huh	1
user:uh|agent:but the it's the only time that i can remember that i can't remember what food it was i it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with several people were supposed to bring you know each like uh a an appetizer and a main dish and a dessert and we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers and|user:uh-huh	uh uh-huh uh	1
agent:<b_aside> Cara hold on just a second <e_aside> as a matter of fact my little one is hollering [laughter-yeah]|user:oh great|user:oh	they're ready to go	0
agent:promote a college or anything huh|agent:uh [laughter] i guess you have not reached the stage where you need to uh|user:she's only about uh uh a little less than two years old	no	1
user:uh you know you y[ou]- you need to go to a school that that handles|user:so|agent:uh-huh	whatever it is you want to do	1
agent:uh-huh|user:uh state institutions|user:premed uh curriculum for the	it was a choice between there and uh	1
agent:yeah|user:kind of difficult sometimes too|user:it's kind of	especially if you have not been away a lot	0
agent:wh[at]- which group do you work in in TI|agent:yeah|user:have some latitude in choosing the place to go	um uh	0
agent:i see|user:no actually i mean i came straight from school to here|user:uh uh	so	1
user:uh|agent:uh-huh|user:i liked it almost as well	but uh	0
agent:um|agent:uh-huh|user:i was surprised by the number of kids that came came by and had heard of you know our school and and were interested in it and	uh you know we uh	0
user:in cost but in uh|user:the uh Vietnam War was uh certainly expensive not only in	the long term effects as far as lives go	0
user:just the whole idea though of of what we were over there for and uh the very unpopular|user:uh|user:people in Vietnam there in the immediate family so	problems that occurred here the riots and the protests and uh it just didn't seem to go over well with the general public like the last one did	1
agent:so you know i- i blame a lot on Uncle Sam because of the fact [vocalized-noise] you know they had it in your living room and|user:hum|agent:and i know my brother won't he spent a lot of time so he came back totally screwed up	um-hum	1
agent:because the people still over there is in trouble|user:yeah|agent:half doing the job	yeah it makes you wonder if if they'd had the same mentality in Nam if they'd have been able to	0
user:hum|agent:[laughter-he] would have just cleaned house i think he would have done better|agent:they should've just let him loose in the city	well that's uh	0
agent:no but here we are you know Saddam wouldn't have been so bad if we had not gave him half the stuff he's got|agent:that's the bad part|user:yeah they certainly shouldn't continue to deal with them as far as monies go	yeah there is already talks of you know	0
agent:tell him hi|agent:oh|user:John Carruthers from Plano yeah so he's	all right will do	1
user:um|agent:uh-huh yeah|agent:oh [laughter] [laughter]	and he was the guy the guy that played in it	0
user:and that one was just a very poignant story it it|agent:okay|user:at any rate i also saw not long ago Once Around that was with Richard Dreyfuss [noise]	it had people it was it was [noise]	0
agent:i was going to read while it was on but then when it started i just couldn't you know read that was a really good movie|agent:yeah|user:oh whoa yeah that's one i can watch over and over and over again	it sure was and you know the second time you see it you understand more subtleties in it there are a number of good movies like that	1
agent:yeah|user:the uh price is as reasonable as renting a video|agent:yeah	and that's the way i do it and i go quite frequently	0
user:uh the action was comfortable and of course i enjoyed those good guy bad guy type conflicts things so|agent:yeah|user:uh i can't really say that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either but	i enjoyed that movie after the first few minutes of gore and there were some others but they were done a little more tastefully	1
user:and of course Robin Williams always just has a|agent:um-hum|user:[noise] the uh disabled person	an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing	0
agent:oh you haven't i've heard that is wonderful and|user:and i'm going to try to get in Dances With Wolves|agent:yeah	um-hum i've heard it's wonderful too but i it's just that they are both very long	0
agent:so i mean it really kind of had a|user:yeah i remember|agent:yeah	um-hum	1
agent:what was the last one i'm trying the last oh like Back to the Future then was the last one|user:and uh i enjoy those and i enj[oy]- i even enjoy some of the Michael J Fox movies i didn't care too much for the last one either it just was not enough to it|agent:[laughter]	uh	1
user:oh well my husband is is a very good golfer|agent:no uh i uh when i was younger i played a little bit and i was horrible [laughter] so i just stopped playing|user:oh really	he's got like a six handicap	0
agent:yes i was slicing actually and as it turns out uh i went and took some lessons for a while because i just i would lose so many balls and it uh make it a horrible time for everybody|user:yeah the slice goes to the right and the hook goes to the left i think|user:yeah	yeah yeah	1
agent:um|user:i can't hit a driver very far and in fact i don't even like to use a driver i use a three iron off the tee|agent:yeah	because i have more control over it	0
agent:may have actually i may have just checked random things i don't i don't recall anymore|agent:i don't i don't i don't know i|user:you know	well yeah if you ever played i mean i feel like anybody that's ever played golf can talk about it and maybe if you can even talk about it if you've if you've um	0
agent:that was about a week and a half ago it was just it it takes over the whole town you know it's all over the news|user:uh-huh|agent:when the LPGA came here i guess	oh sure	1
agent:yeah yeah i have this nasty habit of doing things like either turning my head at the last second or|agent:oh yeah|agent:yeah oh yeah	yeah well that that's interesting	1
user:when i|user:well|agent:that's okay go ahead i- it's no big deal	do you get get um reimbursed for the calls you make or the calls you talk on too	0
user:yeah|agent:and we both just sort of get these random checks in the mail and to be honest i- i really have not been accounting i just sort of figured well it's going to work you know if|user:i see	uh-huh	1
user:yeah it well i mean just recently|agent:year later|agent:i think what it bottom out about a ye[ar]-	i would say i would give it two years back when it was i think bottomed out	1
user:i-|agent:but it's a Sharif Myneer Homes if that means anything it did not really mean anything to me except i liked it|user:oh gee	i- i kept thinking of Omar Sharif every time i saw that name [laughter-somewhere] [laughter-so]	1
user:definitely|user:well because i know our our little house over here stuck in the middle of you know the subdivision is i think fifty five so i think the high end is|agent:i think	you know somewhere around there	1
agent:see when you have kids you like to be able to send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them but i have been watching these houses go up and i- i don't well somebody was telling me i know somebody who lives back there i've always questioned the quality of construction and i- i don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house|user:well see that's the house that we got is small enough so my husband and i because_1 there's just the two of us and the two cats um can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard and we thought that was important instead of [laughter-getting] swallowed up in something that you know|agent:yeah uh-huh	yeah that's [laughter-true]	1
user:i can't|agent:and he was talking he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here and i was thinking well you know i know why your God damn bill is so high it's because there's not a there's no insulation insulation in those things|user:[vocalized-noise]	he has no insulation [laughter-probably]	1
agent:it's a concern of yours right now is|user:something that [vocalized-noise]|user:father and stepmother are not in very good health so this is	yes it is	1
user:i read a lot and then i know people that then have visited nursing homes and|user:um|user:well i- i felt good about it because that's my personal feeling also i	uh have had great grandparents in the nursing homes and it was not a happy situation for	0
user:right and that's right i|agent:and that i think is what is scary and i also feel that that's where some of the bad images um of nursing homes come from is when people have to put people in a nursing homes and they really can not afford the best|user:right right	well i took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation and uh they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home	0
agent:what a shame they put him in the home so that he could be cared for|user:so you know and i [laughter-thought]|agent:oh	right [noise] right	1
user:to that one|agent:well good good i'm glad they have a solution|user:putting him in another home they said he will not go back	i'm glad they the option	1
agent:you can live with right|agent:uh|user:um-hum	visits everyday or	0
user:and uh|agent:um-hum|user:of what she was doing	i ca[n]- i can remember she had several strokes and the nursing home was right next to a hospital	0
user:oh [laughter]|agent:yeah they are always real interesting i remember even in high school that was one of our assignments to read Newsweek and i kind of got hooked on it then|user:i like Newsweek	yeah	1
agent:yeah that stuff and Mainframe Journal and|user:right are they like PC World or|agent:they are not really magazines they are periodicals but i do not know if they would really qualify as magazines i guess so because they have advertising and news print so	beyond that	1
agent:i can't see any of those|user:these are the bad signs|agent:[vocalized-noise] yeah really	so i don't know where i don't what we do with all our magazines we probably	0
agent:[laughter]|user:i just thought i was going to throw up right there in the library it was|agent:[laughter]	not a good day	0
user:um-hum|agent:i was getting some pictures developed at the grocery store and it was taking longer so i was hanging out over there and i was amazed at the different kinds|agent:yeah cause even like in the grocery store you know i do not ever go over and look at the magazines but	[laughter]	1
agent:yeah really|user:that's okay we keep the pu[blishers]- [laughter] magazine publishers in business|user:but	in the midst of the recession we're	1
agent:um-hum|user:oh yes uh-huh um the we have not camped in any of those places in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped um but we|agent:near Dinosaur Valley State Park	used to go to Tyler State Park and um to Dangerfield and	0

agent:trunk of your car all time right|user:uh everything was very convenient and you didn't have to to be hauling things out of your the trunk of you car so that was nice yeah|agent:yeah yeah	so um	0
user:uh are you um|user:it's really quite pretty|user:just we didn't camp there but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area and it's just real lovely it's close to the lake and close to the d[am]- i think it's close to the dam up there so it's	let's see what was i was going to ask you something else oh do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to	1
agent:hm|agent:that's right uh-huh|user:especially with uh uh when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty especially in east Texas it's really nice so	well uh um i've enjoyed talking with you	0

agent:yeah|user:well actually i- i have a whole wallet full of credit cards i don't use them very often um|user:yeah	oh i may use	0
user:uh and saves a lot of time and that's what i was using it for however we had a had a|agent:that's right|agent:yeah	a very	0
user:well i never did|user:um-hum|agent:and the only way to do it is go get you know an advance on a card and so like you were paying for it but it's one of those i'm glad it was there	[noise] right i never did use it for an advance most of my charges were	1

agent:uh-huh|user:pardon my expression there but um|user:people would begin to switch over you know and i think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed and	who would get really you know upset and start to complain and get all cranky and stuff but i think in the end it would make life a lot easier for us	0
agent:right [laughter]|user:could use it comfortably right now but i could convert you know i could carry around a little conversion card or something and|agent:right	i could handle it for a while and then and then eventually i'd learn and i think that	0

user:you know they i think that's what you just said you know having to do more with the size of the school the environment of the school uh|user:and stayed with it|user:i kn[ow]- i know very few people that uh started in one field	i think that's much more important i- i think i'd i'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school though that has a number of different types of programs you know that uh	0
user:um [noise]|user:i hate to talk to the parents because|user:i- i hate to uh	one of the reasons is because you know the kid doesn't know exactly what they want and i always say make sure you major in something that you like even if it's not going to be your career vocation	0

agent:uh-huh|user:that type of show is what we|user:uh Northern Exposure and and uh oh what's that one with Burt Reynolds	what uh we watch we generally just stay on one channel all for all of Monday night just to watch those just	0
user:of when a per[son]- person reaches seventy five|user:involved a tradition|user:uh they were uh it it	uh and i can't remember what day they call it but but uh	0
user:because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and|agent:oh he doesn't|agent:uh-huh	he's broken it and then we saw one where this there was a teenage	0
user:uh|agent:uh-huh|user:yeah it's it they they're trying to liken the the father in there of the teenage son to like Jackie Gleason Show	the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth and i guess maybe there are some parts of that but i didn't really see that in there but what i've read about it they	1
agent:i know|user:doing dishes or i may be sewing or you know i always have or letter writing or i may be working around in the room somehow but i don't|user:and i don't ever no matter what's on i don't ever just sit and watch TV i'm usually either	i don't ever just sit and i that's something that comes from your old age you know	1
agent:but then people started dumping trash and the wrong objects in there and i and that concerned me that people were using it as a way to get rid of things they just didn't want to set at the curb or take to the|user:yeah|user:that	yes	0
user:right|user:uh-huh|agent:the plastics and the and the aluminum and the glass and the paper	yes	1

agent:not such a bad way to go|user:that's right|agent:dad used to do that and pretty soon they're they're figuring out that's	that's true yeah	0
user:uh-huh|agent:to most people and i and even to people in our country who scavenge for food and|user:yes	yeah	0
agent:i i think the big question too we're looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product so it can be recycled|agent:huh|user:good example you know that even industry is willing to do it	yeah	0
agent:okay|user:certainly|agent:Lynn do you do you want to start	um	1
agent:yep i understand|user:and that's one of those things you just have to go once a year|agent:okay	so uh basically it it sorts out into that and then once about once every three or four years i try to get over to England because i lived there for a while	1
agent:we usually book just a month before it's ready to go|agent:gone fairly inexpensive from as most cruises go uh|agent:we've	yeah	1

user:uh-huh [noise]|agent:yeah as i said we've done them three times we'd be going again this this year if circumstances hadn't changed we we'd probably go my husband would you know the minute i said the word he he he's chomping at the bit|agent:oh they they they really are we've	[laughter]	1
agent:isn't that the truth uh-huh|user:but the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer so|agent:yeah	hum	0
user:uh-huh|agent:went to Panama last August our son-in-law is from Panama|user:oh that's interesting	oh	1
user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	well well Pat ha[ve]- did you vote in the last election	1
agent:uh-huh|user:so i- so i just haven't because i mean graduate school or whatever so i haven't kept track of it i did when i lived steadily in one community i always i voted|agent:sure	but this past time i didn't well actually i voted it for the presidential election but then i didn't vote	0
agent:well of course of course listening to government the instructors you'll find out that everything matters but then you could go crazy worrying about everything|user:yeah it's probably true|agent:uh-huh	[laughter]	0
agent:to take that kind of action and that's completely unnecessary In another particular case they were trying to [noise] put in a um|agent:to wake us up and cause us|agent:it took a close call	uh-huh	1
agent:it's very serious just across the street|agent:it's|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:uh campaigns that were based on issues there for two or three of the gubernatorial races but i|user:uh-huh|agent:we were having some pretty healthy	uh-huh	1
agent:we really could use a little positive motivation hey we think this guy can really make some changes and we're going to support him that was true in a lot of cases in|agent:isn't that too bad|user:yeah	uh-huh	1
agent:but i think that one was one that you had some very strong feelings among people and they voted their convictions|user:yeah|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh and you have state income tax also|user:uh we have a six percent sales tax|user:[laughter]	yes	1
agent:uh-huh|user:that's what i thought i know New York ha[s]- also has a sales tax on clothes|agent:um yes we do have tax on clothes	and i know a lot of kids like going to college with me that lived in New York or out of state and a lot of them would buy their clothes in Pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that	1
agent:can't do it any more [laughter] so|user:yeah|agent:can't do oh really	yeah uh-huh i know well i- i- i also was a student i just graduated in May	0
user:uh-huh i think they should go back i- i realize you know that we have uh graduated tax brackets|agent:and i there just i don't know i guess as you say you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what you are and|user:yeah	but i think they should still go back	0
user:right|user:uh-huh|agent:they were saying that the the whole system was going to be um bankrupt you know before very long because so much was going out for programs that were it wa[s]- that originally it was never intended to be used for or you know programs just weren't in existence	uh-huh	1
user:well one thing and i don't know how how long a span a|user:[noise]|agent:yeah	generation is considered whether we're talking you know twenty years or or or whatever	0

agent:yeah|user:y[eah]- yeah and that's how we kind of keep track of things so that when the car [vocalized-noise] you know when the car breaks down or something you you have some money at least you know earmarked for that|agent:that's a good idea	and and it seems to work	1
user:and uh we try to you know make sure where we go and uh|agent:yeah|user:just try not to spend a whole lot you know with some things of course you have to you know	try to catch something on sale or or something like that	0
agent:um|user:well that's a good idea yeah|agent:go ahead and stock up again	have you gone to any of those places that uh	0

user:you have anything else to say or any other|user:well|user:well that sounds that sounds pretty good	plans that you use uh i like what you say about the recycling thing looking at something before you get rid of it that's a good	0
EMPTY	all right um	0
user:i walk with my parents|agent:uh-huh|user:that's a hard question to answer because i do physical things but i don't always set out for them to be exercise	occasionally nothing's real regular about this because i have a weird schedule and they have	1
agent:right right so i'm thirty two years old which is probably different than yourself|user:have to do it|user:i mean i'll voluntarily clean the bathroom but i won't do it if i	uh-huh	1
agent:right|user:i'm getting better about this knowing that i need exercise and doing it but it's still at the task stage|agent:yeah	is it a pleasure for you or are you	0

agent:oh yeah i don't i don't let that bother me but yeah that that's something that comes with time too|user:there's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are|agent:but	yeah	1
user:it's i guess pretty|agent:yeah|user:so	pretty healthy but i don't have an a regular plan that's	0
agent:yep|user:that'll come|agent:and uh so i- i don't i don't think you should worry about not having a program yet	some day when i	1
user:brisket or a roast or a|user:like a|user:i guess if i was having a dinner party i depending on the number of people i might cook a	maybe a chicken dish	1
agent:corn yeah i made French bread with that one too|user:bread do you have bread to go with it|agent:let's see what else did i [noise] serve with that	gosh [noise]	1

agent:oh that's good|agent:oh|user:well i'll have to remember that well i just i that day i just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top and it really stayed longer than i ever thought it would so	i thought maybe that was the trick	1
agent:pork yeah [laughter]|user:less cho[lesterol]- less cholesterol|user:yeah yeah	yeah right right	0
agent:yes|user:[noise] okay	[noise] well this is a very timely topic in as much as we're going to a family reunion this weekend	0
user:right|user:[laughter-never] [laughter-get] [laughter-them_1] at both places|user:yeah yeah	listen they've uh they've had this one well it just of course over the years it has uh built up as far as the organization is concerned	0
agent:so sometimes when these other families get together they're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids and we're kind of off on the sidelines|user:oh|user:oh [laughter]	yeah	1
agent:fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion|user:yeah|user:[noise]	yeah	1

user:[noise] excuse me|agent:not contribute|agent:[noise] yeah and it's not fair that everybody	but um anyway that's the family reunion story [noise]	1
user:is it the do you think it's the values|user:yeah|agent:kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school i mean	that they're teaching in school or the the values they get from home	1
user:uh expect them to to pick it up at school and you're not going to do that you know you're going to carry|user:teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then|user:you know while we're not going to worry about uh	carry with carry to school	0
user:the living conditions of certain people are are subjected too uh|user:and uh part of it's the the family i think and part of it's uh|user:than uh we may have seen in the past uh	drugs is a big problem now and i think that's that's that's another root problem	1
user:basically uh|user:a lot of kids who are|user:where you got	that might be more well to well off you know going to a private	0
user:parochial school like that it's it's because_1 the parents are more interested in them receiving them|user:kids are going to a public|user:well you know in a lot of cases uh like that where you know if	uh uh an education it shows i think it shows that the parents	0
user:the school itself is is has more emphasis on uh|user:maybe the uh|user:um	trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller uh they may be able to to give the resources that's needed	1
user:more|user:uh|user:uh uh stress the importance of education to both both the parents and the students and	more classes that i think that are and i think this is is	0
agent:yeah|user:about learning i think|user:you're not going to care about uh	you know you're not going to really care about yourself	1
user:you don't have any|user:you kn[ow]-|user:the pits and uh	any kind of a en[vironment]- good environment to live in you know it's kind of hard to say well you need to take care of of other people's stuff as well when you're when you you barely have anything yourself so	0
user:i also keep uh|agent:uh-huh|user:right right	all my	0
agent:but y[ou]-|user:but again when you say budget|user:spent	that budget that i make that's supposed to work for the year	1
user:that a big part|user:our house is to an age that|user:uh	that's not budgeted	0
user:well maybe homes for have always been built|agent:the whole bit yes|agent:wet plaster walls and hardwood floors and	more sturdier in the north than down here because of the	0
agent:i think we should have steel girders in our homes and there're not|user:that they know w[hat]- these things to look for|user:i guess so many people don't know that much about construction	hum	1
agent:my income is|agent:but as far as a budget goes i do not have a budget i just know what|user:well if	uh-huh	1
EMPTY	okay	1
agent:up and until they were in the preschool situation i had them in a in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids and i felt like that home environment was very important to them|agent:uh when my children were growing up i actually had them|agent:than [vocalized-noise] the one on one care is	yes	1
agent:uh when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time the pay is minimal|agent:however|user:yes yes	yes it is	1
user:oh my goodness|agent:well i know that when my youngsters were small now my older son was adopted so he went into child care at two weeks [noise] and uh my younger son went into child care at six weeks|user:and that responsibility so uh it is it is a lot different	yeah yeah	1
agent:um-hum um-hum [noise]|user:and go to work after the children are in school you know|agent:that's right once they get up in sch[ool]- um-hum	but uh	1
user:yeah|agent:and uh so it didn't take me long to take them out of that place but that's the only bad experience i had the rest of the time they stayed in La Petite Academy|user:oh how awful	yeah	1
agent:and relay that to them and she said well she said you know kids do exaggerate but she said let's go ahead and send him another day|user:yes|agent:boy it didn't take me very long to hot foot it over to the school	oh good	1

user:[noise] yeah yeah|agent:is it programming related|user:but	program related research related i've	1
agent:no i'm not familiar with it|user:more uh do you know Latek|user:[vocalized-noise] well	word t[ext]- word text processing so i don't i don't use [vocalized-noise] i mean you can call it word processing but i don't usually	0
agent:so you've got you've got a modem in it then|user:just as a terminal and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that|user:[vocalized-noise] and also as [laughter-a]	uh neither one has a modem but we have a modem	1
user:oh i didn't hear it|agent:i think that's the thirty second warning|user:so that was it	do you hear the the beep in the background	1
agent:what time is it now where you are|user:often times that i can't talk on th[e]- can't do this much later than now between sort of like six five thirty and six thirty or something like that because the traffic outside they honk the horn so loud i can't even hear the phone conversation|user:yeah and	uh about twenty after four	1
agent:i do some and i and the D Base work i've done was strictly class related|user:[noise]|agent:um i haven't done much word processing work with my job	um-hum [noise]	1
user:well i don['t]-|agent:um [noise] i wouldn't say compatible but there certainly comparable|user:flexible or allows you to do more or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days	yeah i didn't mean [laughter-compatible] [laughter-i] [laughter-meant] [laughter-comparable] my brain is going to mush	1
agent:okay now now we're supposed to talk about music|agent:[noise]|user:[noise] okay	right	1

agent:it is pretty good she likes it it's a it's a little it's a little too country for me it's little|user:oh yeah well those should be good albums|agent:she bought that the same night we bought the Nat King Cole and the Garth Brooks	if you have the chance	1
agent:uh-huh|user:all my brothers and sisters listen to them even the ones that like the heavy metal|user:but we have i think all his records so far and	they really enjoy listening to him so	0
user:yeah i- i especially agree that if it's an area where they could|agent:they don't like it then they should not be employed there [laughter] that was you know i would not mind it|agent:to drug test employees and	cause somebody else	0
user:but|agent:well [vocalized-noise] unless an employer has a reason to believe that his|agent:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:right|user:probably more widely abused|user:i- i wish they would and that i think is even	by you know the masses	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and and you know our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a in a pool|agent:oh okay	you know so i've already been tested once when i was hired and and once since they initiated this random testing program	0
agent:so i i i would really rather know|agent:right|agent:right	and	1
user:i- i was trying to remember there was a|user:when they do that|agent:right	court case	1
user:and it's still tied up in the|agent:uh-huh uh-huh|user:amendment	legal channels they haven't ruled on whether they can test them or not	1
EMPTY	[noise] okay	0
agent:all the things that are out at the current time|agent:oh we got Memphis Belle and|user:yeah yeah definitely	now is that the one is that the one with uh	0
user:oh really|agent:[noise] down to her level it's songs about getting up and getting dressed and getting dressed on your own by yourself and|agent:and our little two year old granddaughter just loves it and it's real	that'd be neat	1
agent:yes exactly|agent:no who wants to|user:that yeah that don't have a lot of the blood and gore because_1 i just can't deal with that but i do kind of like the suspense	i i mean you know like i- i love old old [Hitchclock/Hitchcock] Hitchcock classics	0
agent:yes|user:yeah it's kind of difficult well like i said this weekend Disney had Singing in the Rain on|agent:and i don't find too many [laughter]	and so i taped it [laughter]	1
agent:[laughter-isn't] that the truth [laughter] that's exactly the truth|agent:we do too|user:no we really don't i mean we we both work and so we're exhausted when we get home and then the weekends there's always so much to do to catch up from what you didn't [laughter-do] all week	so really i think Sunday going to see Robin Hood was the first time i had gone with my husband to the show in a year probably	1
user:uh-huh|agent:no i don't use a family budget my father who's very old has kept one his entire life and i probably re[belled]- rebelled against it and probably should have kept one he keeps every penny that comes in and goes out|user:okay um well do you uh keep a family budget or or do you have some	[laughter]	1
agent:course he's from the depression and uh|agent:that was put over there and i mean uh of|user:oh my yeah	yes	1
agent:and that's really crazy because_1 that's about thirty years ago|agent:in nineteen sixty|user:oh isn't that something	really oh that is that is really really something	1
user:and you know yeah when you|agent:oh yeah you have to do it when you're in school my wife's still in school getting her doctorate and so i it it|agent:um	uh yes	0
agent:K U E N|agent:all right well what's your last name|agent:yeah	uh-huh Z E R	0
agent:i don't know if you've tried any of those there's about four of them around town|user:uh-huh|agent:we enjoy there's an Italian restaurant over in Garland also called Taste of Italy	no i haven't	1
agent:it's not a fancy place i've eaten their lunch primarily [laughter]|user:so what would|agent:which uh serves some excellent food too in that in that style of food	uh-huh [laughter] um so what is your favorite restaurant in Dallas	1
agent:a lots of good restaurants here i think the really hard thing is you want fresh seafood of course uh we're a little bit away from the coast|agent:oh there's|agent:there's uh	um-hum	1
user:[noise]|agent:i think we have i certainly enjoyed talking with you|user:[laughter] well i guess we probably have talked about our five minutes worth	well and i've also written down the Taste of Italy we'll have to try that sometime	1
user:uh i think|user:uh and so let me take the lead uh Angela|agent:okay	what is really important uh [noise] of course salary is very important because that's why you are working is for your it's for the money but job satisfaction to me is also uh very important	0
user:perhaps uh he has uh|agent:[noise]|user:in his benefits like uh	the benefit of having eyeglasses for the family	0
user:uh|user:from any company that we worked for whether they be a conglomerate or just a small|user:we could not do without the benefit package from	uh	0
user:uh a day care center for the|user:to have uh|user:my oldest daughter is uh is uh a nurse and she just received her masters degree and she is now into consulting and that's one of the areas that she is working on	indiv[idual]- the children of the of the nurses that are staffing the facility	0
agent:exactly|user:and they would be deprived of their mother|user:and they would not have the quality	yeah no i understand that totally	1
user:acceptable|agent:i think tha[t]- i think it would be fair i think if if the company could not provide it all on their own for the for the people that would be using it you know a a a certain amount of their salary would go to it but it would still probably be cheaper|user:do you think that would be	i do too	1
agent:the glasses that the exams themselves are not expensive it's the glasses|agent:it would be great i mean|agent:yeah	it depends on who ha[s]- examines your eyes	1
agent:now i think your insurance covers her|user:yes they are|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	0
agent:orthopedic care um not orthopedic orthodontic care|agent:um|user:uh-huh	that's very expensive	1
agent:right but just enough that his bite is off a little bit and it's like four hundred dollars and my insurance is only going to cover like fifty of it|user:uh-huh major|agent:and it affects his speech a little bit not not anything you know	uh-huh	1
agent:i i would much rather that do that to myself than make my five year old [laughter-go] [laughter-in] and do it that would kill me|agent:oh gosh|user:which amazed me	[laughter]	1
agent:where where do you usually go|user:or if it's at the beach the beach is great a pool is great and uh|user:i i enjoy playing tennis so i like to have a tennis court there or	oh well let's see we have plans this year to drive up to the uh	0
user:a smaller on a smaller scale i guess than Silverton but uh and then there's lots and lots of real|user:and uh and then actually north north of that is another town and|agent:right	uh of mountains that are covered with uh	0
agent:i think it's going to cost us per couple about three hundred dollars for the week|agent:because_1 it's got you know pull out couches and all that and uh|agent:and uh	oh [laughter] that's nice [laughter]	1
user:the neighborhood that we live in they're switching to an alternate calendar this year so|user:well we're uh|agent:so	it starting	1
user:so and they hope to boost the|agent:right|user:two month break	they hope to boost the learning of the children	0
agent:okay what uh TV shows do you like and what do you watch|user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	well i- i tend to be a	1
user:well|user:well what i find is that outside of uh|agent:so	sports because i'm a sports fan is	0
user:the it's probably as good a program as any for the audience to play along and see if you think you're smart or smarter then|user:an interesting combination of a a lot of luck and uh|user:which is uh	then those folks are	1
agent:but i do like that show a lot because it follows uh follows a good story line|user:um-hum|agent:and uh so i always end up missing it	yeah i find that it seems to me and uh maybe this is as you get older i'm in my mid forties now but uh	1
agent:um-hum|user:something that seems interesting there i just uh as i say don't find the modern sitcom very uh|user:if there's uh	well just very appealing to my interests	1
agent:right|user:with all their reruns of uh the aviators over the|user:i'm a history buff so	ages and uh who built what planes and all that was uh	1
user:uh i've read a little bit about it but uh|agent:let me see what other [vocalized-noise] oh there's a new TV show out called Dinosaurs did you catch any of that|agent:but uh	i haven't i don't even know if it's running here in Dallas It kind of shows the level of interest i have in	0
user:it's i think the comparison is like baseball managers this year they seem to uh|user:that they uh|agent:um-hum	say two weeks in uh you've had your chance time to uh [laughter]	0
agent:well same here usually it's already by the time we get everything done it's uh time to go to bed [laughter] but uh i've caught that a few times you know Thirty Something and all and uh|agent:right right|agent:[laughter]	um-hum	1
agent:so many things in their back pardon|agent:i think what you have is the way the the justice system works is they bend over backwards trying to protect the guilty|user:um	oh it's insane	0
user:and it seems as though we are uh|agent:yeah|user:um underhanded uh things going on that the public are not aware of	giving the criminal the benefit more than the victim the victim has been victimized twice not only by the perpetrator of the crime but also the courts that try to do the justice	1
agent:who had left the house with full intent to commit crimes carrying a gun in her purse|agent:and the person that killed him was a young woman|user:yes how sad	uh-huh	1
agent:this is it and most people don't take the time|user:people have to be involved|agent:right [noise]	yeah	1
user:i served on a jury for a lady that was having|user:well i am too i mean i i just can't i you know|user:yeah	a mental problem	0
agent:yes oh yes i think so are you um a[re]- are you someone who works outside of your home or have you uh-huh|user:yeah there's been a lot of changes i think there's still uh a lot to be made though [laughter] um-hum|agent:uh-huh	yeah yeah i work for TI	0
agent:well um i uh when i was in college i graduated from college with my bachelor's degree in nineteen sixty four and i was a math major which was a real rarity among women at that time so i was in a lot of classes where uh there i was either the only girl or you know one of just a very few women in the class so that was a change and um even uh i didn't [vocalized-noise] uh use my math um in my work i- i became a technical writer but uh even so there were very very few women in technical writing but that has changed a lot|agent:maybe not huh [laughter]|user:but i thought well i am not going to do that [laughter]	uh-huh	1
agent:one or two percent of the heads of uh chairmen of the board chair p[ersons]- chair persons uh if you say if you will of the board are women in this country and and i thought that you know that's pretty si[gnificantly]- a pretty significantly small number|agent:there was something on TV the other day that said that fewer than|user:oh definitely definitely	uh-huh	1
agent:so anyway do you have children|user:um-hum um-hum exactly|user:um-hum	no huh-uh	1
agent:uh like in the church uh where more and more women are becoming ministers in uh you know in uh protestant congregations and um|agent:uh also in|agent:i don't know i you you see it in	oh yeah	1
agent:and uh i spoke because see the women were filing f[lying]- flying m[issions]- missions into you know for whatever reason into uh|agent:and the only uh branch in the armed fo[rces]- ser[vices]- services that seems willing to do that is the Air Force|user:um-hum um-hum	huh	1
user:oh yeah yeah|agent:no i agree but i am sure that there are women who would would relish that you know kind of an a job so|user:[laughter]	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah well that's good that's good because um|agent:yeah well|agent:yeah	um-hum	0
user:[laughter]|user:[laughter]|user:yeah that's wonderful	yeah that's great	1
agent:and i really would be at a loss to to raise and train a girl i think i would|user:uh-huh|agent:but characteristically you know the women are trained or have been in the past trained in the home	[noise] yeah it's well	1
agent:and were expected to maintain a household|user:uh-huh|agent:women at one time did very heavy physical labor	uh-huh	1
agent:diseases now that used to be predominately male diseases heart disease was characteristic of men now there's almost equally predominant in women|agent:you know m[edical]- medical reports tell us that women are developing|user:uh-huh	right right	1
user:uh|agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh	the family has changed we you know we find ourselves doing things that	0
agent:and i was always very careful to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help i helped them with exactly what they asked for and that's all|user:uh-huh|agent:well in the first place it's not your homework it's your children's homework	uh-huh	1
agent:you know i think that's one of the things that we have today that is very useful and i think every woman ought to deal with it or ought to at least be exposed to it and that is mediation training|agent:uh-huh|user:the one who is going to fix it all and and soothe everybody and she said i am not doing it anymore i i just	um uh-huh	1
agent:uh laser disc players and we used to get uh some movies which is kind of hard with kids sometimes to you know [noise] get some movies that are enjoyable for the kids and not always a strict Disney thing you know when you get eleven and nine year olds they want something a little more active than a cartoon|agent:she had gotten one of those|agent:uh have picnics out there that kind of stuff that was our normal thing we also uh	uh-huh	1
agent:some [noise] [laughter] you know|user:probably some of that went over their heads anyway|agent:but um and it's it's fairly clean there was only one little section of it that they probably edited for TV [noise] but uh we used to watch that a lot i mean that was just real kind of [flap/slap] stick kind of fun stuff we used to watch that with her kids	you know [laughter]	1
user:it's just one of those kind of deals that she spends a lot of time with him she listens to what he has to say|user:i i would say that his mother is probably like one of the perfect mothers she|user:and uh	and he is turning out he is thirteen he is turning out to be a really good kid	0
agent:yeah i mean uh you hear people well there are some people that marry later and then they are very set in their ways and there are activities that they do and well i really do not want to make that sacrifice i have you know been single all these years and or you know we have been married and we have all of our [vocalized-noise] activities and i do not want to change my whole life or i came from a family that i had a very bad childhood and i do not know that right now|user:so i do not feel quite so bad|agent:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:i have some friends that have children uh not that many actually|agent:okay do you ha[ve]- but you have friends that have children that have been	uh	1
agent:oh my|agent:oh|user:and i've just come back and was doing consulting work so i am just taking	a little bit of time off right now	0
agent:i think it does when when they're real little and they're changing every day there's and|user:and|user:but at the same time i really it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now	oh yes	1
agent:right well that it is important for the bonding|user:and you know i play with her most of the time she's awake and i think that is so important|agent:right	[noise]	0
user:and so i think you know she'll be at a i have heard it's a roughage to put them|agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:whereas she'll be about eight or nine months old	into a	1
agent:i you know i- i like that but if it you do not have to put them in child care that's|user:uh-huh|agent:where i couldn't get my hands on them i'm afraid i would probably [laughter-go] [laughter-crazy]	are they all nearby	1
agent:oh that would be wonderful|user:my daughter with her|user:to work on a part time basis i'm hoping i can leave	because_1	0
agent:i do too|user:businesses should have|user:but i think the whole you know ideally i think the	the day care centers there whether it's the parents who take turns watching the kids	0
agent:okay|user:okay|user:[noise]	you there well have you had	0
agent:uh-huh|user:seventy nine and eighty one|user:now my parents are	and they're they're still	1
user:rather than in a city where you probably wouldn't know anyone so that would be to their|agent:uh-huh|user:the nursing home there if if they had to go there there would be some of their old friends there you know and it's and	advantage	1
user:or what but the last say three years since he had to have some kind of brain surgery|user:is failing bad you know i don't know if he has starting of Alzheimer or|user:but my stepfather's health is	he's been going down hill you know	0
user:so she has come to live with her|user:all that kind of stuff she just wasn't doing it you know|user:got to where she couldn't take care of herself anymore in Florida as far as you know eating meals and	daughter	1
agent:then in a sense you you have no friends at the new place|agent:parents had spent their life|agent:where the uh	uh-huh	1
agent:but uh it's something that we all face|agent:well it's it's not an easy choice because it's uh|agent:yes	right	1

agent:it was out out in [vocalized-noise] out in Garland|user:yeah that would be difficult where did you see the boat|agent:don't really have that time off yet so	oh well there's been one sitting up in Addison for the last few days that's really neat it's a Baja but it's huge	0
user:so even if we do not ski but|agent:oh that's true|user:we're forced to talk to each other and there's nothing to interrupt us and it's just so relaxing	now that the water is warm enough we have been skiing a lot	0
agent:huh|user:yeah that was really neat i had never seen the shad do that so that was pretty cool|agent:oh really	so anyway	0
agent:no i did not ev[en]- i did not even look at it i got around the price tag and said okay [laughter] i said that's enough|user:you don't know how big the engine was|agent:yeah	[laughter]	1
agent:well it yeah it is and [vocalized-noise]|user:[laughter] that's outrageous|user:i think i'll keep it in the garage [laughter]	just to have a place to park you boat	1
user:i do not know a lot of people say boats are just a hole in the water that you pour money into but we've been real fortunate we have not had any problems|user:really|agent:yeah [laughter] in it's truest sense right	so but Kyle's real good with the maintenance i think that that's real important	0
agent:yeah do you have any children|user:advice for people taking for parents uh help their their kids through college|agent:oh oh we are supposed to talk	no i just graduated from college	0
agent:i do not know i guess it a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something i do not know but|user:uh-huh|agent:but you know i know it's some people are real adamant about you know going to a certain school or whatever	yeah exactly	1
user:you know|agent:right|agent:uh-huh	you know and uh Clarion was oh it was roughly around six thousand a year	1
agent:oh are you|user:uh Maryland|agent:oh i see where are you going to move to	uh-huh	1
agent:uh since you were paid for school yourself did y[ou]- do you think you had a different outlook on it like your grades and things like that|agent:yeah well did you|agent:right	uh yeah because i was paying for it myself i kind of slacked off because i felt it was mine and i could do with it what i wanted	0
agent:uh-huh|user:so i went and i just took business|agent:yeah you are right exactly	well being as i was paying for it myself you know i just kept you do not get into your major until like your second or third year	1
agent:yeah|user:oh my gosh i would like to see the results on a study done i think they would do a lot better because they're more focused|agent:uh-huh	they know exactly what they want to do	1
agent:[noise] so uh yeah it was too bad it was really rough|user:yeah that|agent:uh it was always my mother's fault she was not uh sufficient you know she just was not good enough what was wrong with her was she not attractive enough did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest it was that kind of an attitude	that's too bad	1
user:oh|user:yeah|agent:yeah hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back you know	bless her heart	1
agent:uh-huh|user:and i can uh relate to that uh|user:well i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well uh Nickie	uh i think it's it's the image that the woman has and uh	0
user:in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition|user:and uh i think that uh|agent:uh-huh	that they deserve	0
agent:uh-huh|user:you know uh be on the same level|user:and they know that they can uh	and they do not have any	0
user:what i would like to see happen|user:and i|user:uh	futuristically	0
agent:you know it's always you said you were going to do something and you did not do it as if he is the boss and i am the you know and i am the slave and it those are the only only issues we ever fight about|agent:it's never over|agent:probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time but when he gets angry it's always over control issues it's always over power issues	hm uh-huh uh-huh	1
agent:hm|user:there's a conflict|user:before	uh and i think that can happen in a very won[derful]- wonderful way	1
agent:uh-huh it would be|user:relationship|user:that would be a beautiful	and i think there are some people that	1
user:uh-huh|agent:when they have teachers' holidays and that kind of stuff i will take my friends' kids that are usually in day care|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:well|user:and|agent:well how did you go about selecting a college then	we didn't do it right all the time [laughter] with our first boy we persuaded him to start here and i do not always think you should	0
agent:uh-huh|user:just learning to work on engines and that|user:[noise] oh	uh it has to do with airplanes and everything which is what his whole life is [laughter] and i really wish we would have let him go	0
user:and she soon realized you know even though she didn't like Clarion she came back and finished at Clarion|user:more expensive|user:uh she went there two years and it was	because it uh saved her quite a bit of money and she got really the same basic education that she wanted	1
user:had that|user:uh yeah they kind of|user:uh-huh	they just expected to go	0
agent:i was making more than i was making three times what my father was making|user:you know that boggles my mind|agent:[laughter] yeah i was	uh-huh uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|user:uh|agent:i am not going to say i resent it but i was well one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and you know one of the Rhodes Scholars kids and	uh-huh	1
user:[laughter]|agent:and put into someplace else where people thought differently looked differently sounded differently uh different life style|user:uh-huh uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:see that's the way we are we're more of a rural|agent:it's very different|user:it's quite a bit different	type of a area	1
agent:uh-huh|user:pretty much borrowed for their school|user:you know they're better off now our children all	uh we we did all we could	1
user:with that|agent:yeah if it's a it's a it presents a clear and present danger i mean it|user:deputies he is out free walking the street i have a real problem	i think so	1
agent:there should be a limit on how many appeals can be made|agent:i don't know how to fix it i mean it just seems like there|agent:you know a tri[al]- a trial	um-hum um-hum um-hum	1
user:because they have had them they have had them killed when they've|agent:well that bothers me that that bothers me a great deal i had a friend who was a police officer who was killed in the line of duty|user:hm and and how do you feel about murders of law officers or fire people or something that are	um um um	1
user:i think this giving excuses is pretty|agent:so i i d[o]- i do feel strongly about|agent:and that's uh	prevalent uh uh y[ou]- i work in the school district and the all these kids they've they've got an excuse for everything	0
user:i- i i sometimes think if if i were on a jury and and had to make the decision could i|user:it's it's uh|agent:yeah	and i like to think i could if like you if if e[specially]- e[specially]- especially violent	0
agent:yeah i Consumer Digest|agent:but we take Consumer|user:oh i see do you subscribe to any others	oh	1

user:uh you know because they come|user:i just kind of stick to these two now but|user:some of those but i	to i do subscribe and they come once a week so	0
user:movie stars or|user:about|user:usually	famous people	0
agent:uh-huh|user:yeah that's probably what we should do like they they do books [vocalized-noise] that way you know so uh|agent:yeah or get somebody in the neighborhood to to do it and then everybody pass it through	okay so does your mother still take People magazine	1
user:it's more|agent:more|user:uh-huh and and it's	as i can think more people do i think just read books	1
EMPTY	there we go uh	0

user:you know lowers the cost of everything and all insurance|user:in some sense that that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes|user:a news special or something like that and they were saying how	and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up	0
user:oh|agent:would go for it|agent:chauvinistic as far as women go uh oh it was it was entertaining but um yeah i don't think the general audience would	well the most recent one that uh my wife and i have seen was the City Slicker	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:was it oh good|user:but excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby	uh	1
agent:it's it's fun it's a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once|user:yeah|agent:oh we don't get out as much as we'd like we have two children so we [laughter] occasionally get out to the movies but uh	yeah	1

agent:yeah me too [laughter]|user:so if one of like my husband's driving then he soot scoots his seat back|user:like when my husband and my sons and sons-in-law all have long legs they're tall people and	and so we can't put a we can't put a tall person with long legs behind him	1

user:i- i don't know i you know i just hear that|user:well i just|user:oh my	when you read about Houston seems like they're course all their advertising or not advertising but news reporting is maybe an oil	1
agent:yeah never heard of limousines being a good buy know we had plenty of real estate though|user:you know to see her drive up [laughter-in] [laughter-front] [laughter-of] [laughter-the] [laughter-school] everybody wonders who it is|user:is this	it was just a	1
agent:longer probably if it's split it it varies though between the prin[cipal]- from one principal to another|agent:uh no i think it needs to be|agent:the only	yeah	1
agent:do you wear um suits very much|user:the one day that i did it and i got caught|agent:[laughter]	um no i really don't my	0
agent:but anyway they they still sit around in drawers and boxes and i i get them out|user:[noise] really|agent:yeah that's [laughter] that's really [laughter-true] [laughter-because] who would want it down here	hum	1
agent:hum i'll have to look at those that sounds interesting|user:yeah they do have them_1 at Dillard's and|agent:but they carry them_1 at Dillard's	yeah i really enjoy them_1 i've g[otten]- i've and it's real funny too because i've had a lot of compliments on them_1 when i wear them	0
agent:um-hum that's true|user:so i need to kind of acclimate my wardrobe to a lot of skirts and shirts i think where then that way i could at least wear the shirts on the weekend|agent:[laughter-um-hum]	put them_1 with my shorts or something	1
agent:my kids are twelve and fifteen|user:oh yeah i can imagine|agent:old enough that they really care what they're wearing	oh	1
user:[noise]|agent:i mean they are absolutely demolished there are pieces hanging off of them|user:[laughter]	oh my gosh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:of really good you know work leather nice men's dress shoes and they were about a hundred and fifty dollars or you know something like that and you know he said i felt terrible spending that amount of money|user:[laughter]	wow	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:you know|user:you know the suburb i'm in is more of the upper middle class so	i think our uh not that we don't have a certain amount of local	0
agent:uh-huh|user:well uh the thing is i don't it's one of those things where if you're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on unfortunately there are often these correlations that are|agent:can prevent crime	inverse of what they should be like uh	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:yeah i think|user:aspect of uh	uh the pushers the dealers and the addicts	0
user:it comes a bit from the angle that the uh|agent:yeah|user:you know in a sense i don't i'm n[ot]- i have real mixed feelings on that because	uh	0
user:who had ruined it|agent:um-hum|user:society didn't try to then save themselves from it they let this person	uh	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:yeah|user:yeah well th[e]- some of that and of course i'm a baby of the old school but it it bothers me from the fifties on not that i'd remember that much from the fifties but	but basically	1
user:people are|user:but you know the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the uh in Europe they seem to have mentality and drunk driving is a good one is that|agent:[laughter-yeah]	well indoctrinated their society that drunken driving is unacceptable	1
agent:you know of recovery and the difficulties|agent:that that was an awful three years afterwards|agent:that was a very uh	uh-huh	1
agent:so|user:oh|agent:and uh my brother became involved with them over twenty years ago as a manager and then ended up being both manager and conductor for quite a number of years	that that must have been wonderful [vocalized-noise] were you able to hear	1
user:to a lot of different um|user:my dad enjoyed opera and classical music and ballets and so um even as a child i got to go|user:um	kinds of musical events um i grew up in Detroit and so we	0
agent:oh yeah i- i was in the band in high school|user:with marching band and i really enjoy band music um|agent:uh-huh	it	1
user:so i've|agent:right|user:composers other than the traditional Sousa and things that everybody knows and	enjoyed this so much um with our son	0
agent:but then it's hard to find a place to stack that much music|agent:[laughter-if] i wanted [laughter-to] at this point|user:God	yes	1
user:i uh|user:okay well|agent:okay	i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers i'm not a lawyer	1
user:because_1 i find that uh|user:yeah|agent:from murder on up to like tax stuff you know	i've been on a few juries and uh	1
user:uh|user:or the fair sentence and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is|user:uh	you know the range of of possible values or terms or you know how heinous was the crime	1
agent:ha[ve]- have more pull which that does happen i mean w[e]- we can't say it doesn't because it does happen i mean not everybody is is|agent:and you know sometimes might|agent:that has a name that is the defendant	um-hum	1
user:uh|user:uh and we don't have uh again a lot of knowledge so we don't know what is really going on what is|user:because we see the headlines	really the range of sentences or awards	0
user:only decide the charges|user:juries|user:it's restricted in the sense that	that are actually	0
user:it's what information is presented and|agent:yeah|user:usually don't get to hear all the information	uh i don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards but often juries	0
user:so uh you're|agent:most of the criminal acts that are done are done by guns that are bought in a gun shop though i believe it's probably [noise] bought across the market and i don't think gun control is gonna have any control over that at all [noise]|agent:um i don't believe that	you're for no restrictions or	1
agent:that's right nobody over there carries guns|user:yeah don't they carry don't their policemen over there carry these billy clubs|user:England	yeah	1
agent:no i don't either [noise] well it is terrible when you have to ride down the street and think somebody could just shoot at you for nothing which has been in the news a lot lately|user:and uh of course i'm like you i don't like to kill things|user:and i worry about it being stolen	so	1
agent:not in this country|user:yeah so|agent:i don't either that's the problem	some[where]- somewhere along the line then uh	0
agent:yeah i think that would i think that's the only way|user:like like you suggested|agent:right i could go for that	okay Betty well	0
user:substitute teacher|agent:[vocalized-noise] i'm a s[ubstitute]- i'm a substitute teacher is is this Pat i'm talking to now yeah i'm a substitute teacher in i believe the same school system we both work in|user:teaching	yes it is it is uh-huh	1
agent:you know you try to layer so you can add or or or take off|user:i guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there|user:uh	subtract	0
agent:uh-huh|user:you know wear jackets more in the winter than i do in the summer|user:add a heavier jacket or	that's about	1
user:right right so that would kind of give you|agent:right it might be Thursday for the high schools and it may be Friday for the senior high schools|user:right on what Thursd[ay]- Thursday	a clue i guess and and sometimes you get the long term stuff so you're aware ahead of time	1
user:i don't know that that looks that bad|user:and and uh|user:uh you know they'll wear it with a nice top	but if you're going to tell the kids they c[an]- have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too	1
agent:yeah well at Vines the coaches don't do that they they dress pretty good i would say and then they go to their coaching and they they put their shorts on there|user:health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period so [laughter]|user:right that i didn't ever understand i mean we've got coaches that teach	whether	1
agent:well it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run i think that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe|user:in accordance with that|agent:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:well i think it does it it takes their minds off of of trying to compete|user:helps their educational process there|agent:yeah	Highland Park's thinking about going that route	1
user:i guess my favorite kind of f[oods]- foods would be|user:um|agent:uh-huh	uh the ones that	1
agent:and you know i always watched and thought well i wonder if that's any good you know it looks kind of [laughter-small] but actually it wasn't bad at all|agent:and uh|user:uh-huh	yeah yeah	1
agent:is some type of a like a a pianist or something that will play some music while your eating and stuff and that was that that was kind of neat|agent:the other thing i've liked too is uh now this isn't you don't have this at at family restaurants but uh|user:yeah	um-hum	1
agent:[noise]	[noise]	0
agent:well that's true of course uh you know i- for me my son he's only six and|user:and uh for more than just [vocalized-noise] academics but you know if it's a party school or not although i think every school [noise] is a party school to some degree personally [laughter]|user:i i think you know i- just in terms of of what happened i think that first of all i'd i would know the reputation of the school	right	1
user:uh-huh|agent:between uh students i knew everybody within my dorm but that was it|agent:a[nd]- and for me i had to admit the one thing that i lacked was the uh interaction	yeah	1
user:same deal|user:yeah|user:uh-huh	yeah	0
agent:forty dollars per semester hour|agent:to|agent:but then i was there for about two and a half years they then switched it	oh wow	1
agent:that's a long way|user:with with the travel expenses and so on although she didn't come home that much [vocalized-noise] actually|user:uh	i would say between	0
EMPTY	[noise]	0
agent:yeah|user:[noise] or what they do exactly but i do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before he can either you know either he or she can either|agent:agree	go free or to jail either one	1
user:um|user:i think in in the end the judge has the presiding you know|user:i- i- i think	vote i think he can be you know	0
user:but|user:i mean i think it's as fair as it can possibly get|user:i- i think it's just i don't	i just think it's really har[d]- you know i mean some cases go on for years	0
agent:but i'm not sure who gets [laughter-them] [laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-know] [laughter-anything] [laughter]|user:um-hum|agent:[noise] infraction	[noise]	0
agent:o[kay]- okay well it was nice talking with you|agent:just wait for someone else|user:no i don't know what else to say so	it was nice talking to you too [vocalized-noise] bye	1
agent:yeah my husband is a landscaper and so they all bought the rec[ycled]- or the mulching mowers so that they don't they don't bag anything anymore|user:and uh so that seems to be helping a little bit too|agent:yeah	oh	1
user:oh that's great|agent:yeah and i hadn't thought about that [laughter-so] i'm going to make everybody start doing that they think i'm nuts [laughter]|user:ooh that's a good idea	[laughter] well no you've got to do that uh	1
agent:yeah [laughter]|user:uh so until we get curbside service we cart it all over every once in a while but they're real good about it um they're real responsible much better than i am|agent:well that's neat	really about um sorting things out so	0
agent:yeah and even just the companies coming out with more things like that|user:more people doing that yeah|agent:i wish they'd get more into that	um-hum	1
user:um but we did an interesting thing in my classroom um calculating|agent:yeah|user:uh to where part of the diaper can be recycled or degraded	the number of uh diapers that were used for my class of kids just	0
agent:well did you go to college|user:okay|agent:okay	yes i did	1

user:um yeah those um and those were several uh|agent:areas to look at in making the decision|agent:on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford or you know there's all of these	that we did consider	0
user:they also had a strong language department and i'd always loved working with children um|user:i ended up majoring in French one of the reasons i picked the school was because they had a strong science department|user:i and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing and	and	1
user:um and really his his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of|user:yes [laughter]|agent:well then he should come to U T [laughter]	eight hundred and fifty to a thousand	0
user:well th[at's]- that's certainly um|agent:but um|agent:so that's how you know my decision was made	especially today with the cost of college i mean that is a a major	1
user:know what she'd like|user:we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind does your daughter|agent:huh	to do	1
user:[vocalized-noise]|user:uh-huh|agent:well i think for me i i'm from Alabama south Alabama and so i grew up in the midst of civil rights movement	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:we really didn't have things like that going on that we you know uh ran into|user:in Clarion County and uh	so we kind of uh i guess when i think of social changes i think	0
agent:well and they're so busy people people's personal schedules|user:well they're so spread out i think has a lot to do with it|user:uh-huh uh-huh	uh-huh uh-huh	1
agent:drop in on people anymore|user:no huh-uh they don't do as much|agent:but even just social visits people don't do that anymore you're right and people don't feel comfortable just to	uh-huh	1
agent:out of fifteen that|user:uh-huh|agent:go away i'm just one of the two	uh-huh	1
agent:well i think|user:tried to think of some other things and i couldn't really|user:so [noise] well there's the main things i can think of i really	that	1
user:effort and concentration [laughter] and if you're busy with school|user:before they settle in because a marriage takes a lot of|user:yeah well even to get school finished i think a lot of times it's better if they do finish their schooling	it's i think it's really difficult for a family	1
agent:they are the first generation that basically grew up with day care|user:yes uh-huh|user:uh-huh	that's right yeah	1
agent:i'm driving tomorr[ow]- i'm i'm driving home tomorrow so to go be there for the Fourth of July|agent:in fact i'm|user:uh-huh that's worse yet [laughter]	oh are you really	1

agent:just the kids|user:but our dog does have plenty of company let me because of the uh we have a|agent:um-hum	the fence that we have has slats in it so he can see outside	0
agent:uh rather than giving them a a break from that area during the day|agent:to eat|agent:i think my biggest c[omplaint]- problem with the Plano schools right now is that many of the schools do not have cafeterias and kids have to take their lunch back to their classroom	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:i think it makes very hard to tell where an actual problem is|user:uh the curriculums differ so much and i'm not saying that that's bad necessarily but	you know you can't really tell from a group of students if it's a	0
agent:yeah|user:by anything besides what they're interests are|user:it doesn't divide people by	and it's a mu[ch]- high[er]- it's a learning environment if you're grou[p]- if you're interested in sciences and you're grouped with other people that are interested in sciences	1
agent:it is somewhat divided by east and west Plano with Central Expressway down the middle|agent:uh i live on|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:middle school and elementary school all of those grades in one building|agent:uh fact they have a couple of huge schools that are actually almost all|agent:and then they'll have	huh	1
user:the weather has been certainly has been hot and it's been humid i don't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high|user:well|agent:[noise]	for uh this late into uh well it's not really late into the summer but the the humidity has hung around all of June	1
agent:you know and here it was like pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime and you really didn't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out|user:that's right that's right|user:oh yeah	yeah	1
user:anyway so that kind of uh well i had been down here to visit so i finished school and|user:new career but uh|agent:okay	said hey let's you know	0
agent:that's enough to uh do some boating and was lots of fun|user:yeah|agent:you know like maybe a mile two long	that's right	0
user:oh|agent:you know to go skiing and stuff|agent:we had uh Pine Knob	right right	1
agent:and i remember getting up and somebody telling me hey better wait to go to work because the roads are all you know snow [laughter] and i was laughing going yeah right that's a good practical joke ha ha|user:yeah yeah|agent:there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December be[fore]- couple days before Christmas it lasted only a few hours like by noon it was gone	[laughter]	1
agent:i'm not sure how they'll do this year i don't know who they'll use as quarterback|agent:right|agent:the Bears	Chica[go]- Chi[cago]-	1
user:wingback or something like that that would go down the field and|user:well is he a fragile uh football player you know they had an end or a a|agent:uh particularly probably down in the end zone where Troy can go back there and put one up in the sky and let him go up and get it	and uh he did real good for the Cowboys and every time he turned around he was getting hurt	1
agent:well that's the theory [laughter]|user:and Jimmy's going to leave the offense to the offensive coach|agent:so far the players are are uh re[sponding]- responding well to	yeah uh-huh [laughter] and what about the quarterback do you think he is uh going to stick in there and not wind up there with a concussion	1
user:yeah and it had holes in it and it had big tire on it where|agent:corrugated tin fence around it painted blue|agent:i think that was the place that had the looked like	the former coach you know uh stood up in there in there and	0
agent:[laughter]|user:of uh missing a play by talking to somebody in the group|user:yeah i i i find myself uh when i go to the football games of uh	or a st[ands]- a fan stands up or i'm looking at the cheerleaders	0
user:yes absolutely and|agent:they'll be successful and they'll have a lot more sellouts and fewer blackouts this year|agent:i'm hoping that	and uh if the team	0
agent:yeah he is that|user:he's all business and he got a lot he got he got rid of a lot of the cry babies uh the people that thought that had it they had it made because uh|user:i think that uh they will come back and Johnson while he's unorthodox i think he is doing a good job and he's all uh	they were stars	0
user:you know to|user:is interested in making a dollar and and they've certainly gone to uh great lengths to|user:that uh owns that oilman and his partners that own the team uh	bring the team back into Texas for spring training	0
user:yeah|agent:is that right|user:i like well what i usually do is fresh water fishing i haven't been salt water fishing since i was about ten	and i do everything up at Lake Texoma	0
agent:well i couldn't believe some of the striper that these people were pulling out and there were just people galore for that matter just just everywhere|agent:big time|user:oh my gosh that's supposed to be the greatest time to fish	yeah	1
user:but uh so now my cousin will i make him get up early in the morning and take me out striper fishing and then|agent:i'll be|user:yeah follow that channel on up	we usually fish under the bridge at night with the kids and his wife and stuff like that because	0
agent:and so i went with him in the middle of May and much to our surprise when we got there all the lakes were still frozen [laughter] [laughter-no] yeah the first week we were there we just had to camp and uh we could go on the streams they were open up you know the f[lowing]- where the water was flowing|user:oh my goodness|agent:he had a two week period he he had to work with before he got shipped off to Germany	oh you're kidding ooh not for me	1
agent:wow|user:and uh so then we had a huge fish fry the next afternoon and we went back out fishing and we caught and brought in thirty three more and had thrown a bunch of the little ones back but we had more fun|agent:yeah	those kids they've got real fishing poles but they're the little short ones	1
agent:uh-huh|user:but where we camp there there's a you know little bit of a inlet where we park the boats and stuff so real early in the morning before it gets hot and then you know right at dusk|agent:yeah	um down in the trees down there boy all those little sunfish come up	0
agent:and just fished you know from the shore like in the winter you know one Christmas trip|agent:and we've i guess we went out one time|agent:and	uh-huh	1
user:and course in Plano that's a big deal we'd|user:coached some and went to all the games and|user:were in gymnastics or soccer or baseball or basketball whatever we were always involved in the parent club and	even where we lived in Albuquerque before there's a lot of parent involvement in children's lives	1
user:um-hum|agent:mean that's that's one of my that's my downfall on my side of that that that aspect|user:oh	um-hum	1
agent:what do you what do you what difference do you see in those kids that than ones with a mother and father in the participation|user:lack of of uh family life|user:uh us[ually]- you know a lot of times it's a single mother trying to raise and of course i i deal with adolescents so that's where it fourteen fifteen that's where it really starts coming out this	well	0
user:when you've got a a child that's just coming from a situation a move is a terrible thing on a child it's it's just such a traumatic especially if they've lived|agent:right|user:to your classes and things like that and and uh	for any length of time	0
user:but i stayed home up until then when by that time my oldest was|agent:right|user:when my youngest was in third grade i went back to work	oh she's about	1
user:that that it would be handled the same way they h[andled]- dealt with other p[arents]- other kids|user:i said i don't want teachers coming to me in the middle of the day when they couldn't get to anybody else's mother in the middle of the day|user:and uh but i had an understanding with the principal that under no circumstances was i to be treated any differently i don't want	it it gets real easy when a mother is in a school or a father even for a teacher to every time some little thing goes wrong to run and pretty soon all you're hearing is negative things	0
user:uh for the parents who cannot be there to parent during the day|user:well i think unfortunately what what we're seeing in the very few of the instances is that|agent:and all kids do they they need discipline	their idea of parenting is	0
user:it it it's and i[t's]- it's difficult i understand i i know a lot of single women that are working two jobs just to keep a roof over the kid's head and keep food on the table and i don't know how these women are supposed to have|agent:get hooked up with the wrong people so|user:um-hum	time to to parent i[t's]- it's i don't i don't know what the answer is to it it's it's really sad	1
agent:well of course i'm the little short one that sits on the end by Judy Dillon|user:uh Christ United Methodist|agent:okay what choir are you from	oh okay i'm in the soprano parts	1
agent:great we can do that|user:and then maybe we can share a recipe with what they kind of what it kind of said|user:a menu for a dinner party	uh	0
user:yeah it's real good|agent:that's a wonderful recipe|user:and then you just use it for dipping your chip into [noise] and	and then a	1
agent:i'm [laughter-afraid] i'm not a real fancy sit down kind of use your best china|agent:so i|user:uh-huh uh-huh	oh	1
agent:it can be anything i [vocalized-noise] i may just bring fresh fruit because i know everybody will eat that even though it's not|user:okay|agent:it can be anything	okay	1
user:well|agent:okay i've enjoyed talking to you and i if i have a Mexican dinner at anytime i'll do i think i'll run your yours by and have fajitas and bean dip and the whole nine yards|user:okay well then if we're done it's all we do is just say good-bye right	yeah i'll get	1
agent:but uh|agent:uh it might be tied into the equation somehow|user:uh-huh	yeah i know uh	0
user:high beam drives as opposed to a low beam|user:you tend to think well there's one fuse operating the whole thing but sometimes the extra amperage that a|agent:uh-huh	uh requires uh the use of a of a maybe a higher fuse	1
agent:uh repaired i'd purchased it at at Sam's|agent:a uh one of these jam box portable dual cassette players|agent:however did uh have to get a	uh-huh	1
user:and we found that the uh|user:i don't know what else it all controls but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort|user:mixer and uh	uh we were having two problems it was	0
user:check it out and at first they thought it was just a|user:we took it back to the uh Oldsmobile place and asked them to|user:so	matter of timing so they adjusted timing and the problem didn't go away so we ended up taking it back again	0
user:a pickup|agent:do|user:we've got um	twice a week that they come out and they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody and	0
agent:and uh aluminum cans and plastics|agent:from there we now recycle glass and newspapers|user:uh-huh	really	1
user:when they turned them in but|agent:uh-huh|user:we got uh because when the kids first went down i said that you know that's great and i was thinking you know maybe i'd help supplement it you know	its amazing how many cans you go through	1
agent:uh if you're catching your grass clippings that that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn it's amazing|user:uh-huh|agent:sure it does sure it does it really does and it actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not	yeah	1
agent:oh they do uh-huh and do you have to sort that|user:they pick up the the plastic the glass and the newspaper|user:for them to do	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:oh i know well the kids have even got to the point where they if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can you know they they're oh no don't do that and they go to the sink they rinse them out and they put them upside down they let them drain and|user:it is	and then uh after a couple of days	0
user:[laughter]|user:didn't one|user:she'd	oh really	0
agent:i as i think i mentioned i was in the trust business and i've seen so many elderly people usually there has to be some wealth involved which is great if if you're financially if if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money|agent:yeah|user:yeah i don't understand that they they don't want to be with anybody else	uh-huh	1
agent:to to family members my husband's mother will have major surgery and we'll find out about it in a casual conversation|user:uh|agent:well they fear being dependent on somebody they they fear being a burden	[laughter]	1
agent:repainted a couple of chairs and repainted a dresser and|user:uh-huh|agent:August so i've been trying to get some things in the house organized for that and have	oh	1
user:later on|agent:yeah something to cover them and keep them [laughter-warm] [laughter] that's right|user:something they can keep for a long time and enjoy	keep them warm that's always beneficial too	1
user:yeah but um|agent:it's more tedious|user:of a hobby	[noise] i'm interested in music so i do a few things in that regard	1
agent:you're more interes[ted]- interested in the instruments then in voice|user:and uh i play it from time to time as well|user:i used to play the clarinet and i still have one or actually recently just got another one	well i am in a a church choir in fact it's that organization that uh	1
agent:yeah in in ninth grade our high school is Northern Highlands in New Jersey|user:well that's different|user:did you really	uh-huh	1
agent:i don't i don't know how long we've gone but|user:would be my guess so|agent:yeah c[ause]-	yeah oh i'm sure it's been adequate	1
user:that's something that my family has always believed strongly in and um|user:i guess that's [vocalized-noise] my|user:i just um	i had opportunities in high school	1
user:yeah well i think sometimes through groups and organizations um|agent:uh families for their friends where now i'm not sure they really do|agent:their	my first when i first thought of it i thought it uh	0
user:that could|agent:you know but eve[n]- even through those gr[oups]- groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to|user:number	no um not since um	1
agent:but i grew up in a real small town in Florida|agent:yeah|agent:gosh i hadn't even thought about it being out of the area but you're right	oh	1
agent:at least around here um|agent:early teenagers anyway i think it's too late now|agent:oh	yeah i think uh	1
agent:because_1 if you don't it for your for your own immediate family your sure not going to do it for anybody else|agent:uh yeah i would have to start in the families first|user:ah that's something that i think that has been lost in families and i think that's a good place to start again	yeah	1
agent:well that's that's great i'm glad that there are still some areas that|agent:um-hum|user:and that's just the t[wo]- two weeks during during the summer so if two weeks um could have that kind of effect i would	think uh	1
EMPTY	[noise]	1
user:you know yes but for those students who are determined to do well anyway|user:but then the follow-up the next day was i was kind of glad to see because it it said that|agent:um-hum	that you know handling a job was very possible	1
user:you know getting your education well when they meant said the the topic you know of what's wrong with the public schools my my first im[pulse]- impulse was|agent:your education|agent:right	it isn't	0
user:hm|agent:social problems uh mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security|agent:now are supposed to solve	yeah	1
user:tougher and rougher age and all that but you know part of my feeling is that if you solve|user:you know at a|user:and i was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school and they said oh but we need more in the middle school because that's when kids are	help them to work through their problems while they're littler	0
agent:than what are we going to do with them|agent:are not getting their education for one reason or another|agent:because um education is the key to our future and uh if we have children who	yeah that's right	1
user:economic value|user:the public education is the best|user:oh they have all these different names for things strategies and all these different things but anyway one of the key things was that that we believed that	then i think they decided to strike	0
user:um-hum|agent:where they don't try to educate everyone that's one of the things that we do we try to educate everyone|user:right	that's right	0
user:that is here in the ninth grade i believe it's something like that it's worded|user:um|user:the Plano school district's you know goal is that they will graduate every child that	and um	1
user:my folks talk about it a lot in Illinois my mother is was a teacher for years and years|user:to be in situations and schools where we don't see that|agent:we are	and um	1
agent:[noise]	[noise]	1
user:uh-huh|agent:and uh [noise] we've just been real lucky [laughter] i think anyway to not|user:yeah	it's not hard to find anything that's part-time so many of the churches have really strong	0
agent:did you have your children did you say in home in in private care was that in your home or in someone else's home|user:uh-huh|agent:well that's hard it's so difficult for them um	until they were two yeah yeah both times they were at our house	0
user:yeah|agent:and the the doctor that was on there the pediatrician said you know i can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day care and leaving them there|agent:and they've now moved it to Washington DC	oh that would be hard	1
agent:right|agent:right|user:our age group it's too late too little too late	but i [noise] i do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work	0
user:uh-huh|agent:you know a pri[vate]- a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age and they|agent:that's good to know i got a couple of friends that have have found the uh	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:when i was smaller we my family lived in Tennessee|user:that's nice oh i love blackberries and we w[e]- uh	and there used to be wild	0
agent:yeah|agent:had somehow gotten in [noise] yeah|user:and i went and took a shower and looked back out there and she was already in it and i was so mad so i can't do anything back there	because_1 she just she destroys it but i've tried out in the front but like you said that that freeze that came	0
agent:yeah|user:a[nd]- and they're big and [vocalized-noise] they're real full and everything you know in the summer time but it it's killing everything underneath|agent:um-hum	where the leaves are shading the tree but	0
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:and they've got mini-blinds and stuff but only only one is really like in the flower bed part and the other one is out on the porch	so there's not really much i can do about that	1
agent:uh-huh|user:it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard and|user:i'm	and i just [noise] i really do not	0
user:[laughter]|agent:real small they're maybe about oh two inches long they're real small they're real tiny they're cute they really are cute [laughter]|user:how big is a dwarf hamster	yeah	1
agent:uh-huh|user:we've uh we've tried various things we you know obviously do have children|agent:uh-huh	and uh we tried a dog first	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and then we tried cats|user:so we we have we gave up on that	and we ended up with a	1
user:uh so we gave it a try|user:you know wanted to get rid of these kittens and|user:uh	and uh they were impossible to house train	1
agent:huh|user:changed it frequently and|agent:really really huh	it was just unbelievable	0
agent:and he'd they said he's AKC registered he's two years old and he's going to go fast|user:good grief|agent:but we had one dropped off last night	i'll bet yeah	1
agent:the hamsters actually it's the dog that is enthralled with the hamsters because the hamsters are recent you know they were just last week|user:well has the cat discovered the uh the hamsters yet|agent:yeah	oh	1
user:pretty much over time has figured out a way|user:i think that|agent:really	to get those small creatures	0
agent:okay i guess we're going to discuss food and cooking|agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	alright	1
agent:yeah [laughter] that's true uh|user:and i told him he's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches teenage years so|agent:does he [laughter] well	he can eat	1
agent:a large amount and so i f[reeze]- usually we eat one and i freeze two containers of it|agent:but uh no this is just re[ally]- it is really good and and one thing that's good is it makes the|agent:if you do that yeah [laughter] i don't either	oh	1
user:yeah i've got a chicken casserole that's like that that|agent:you know to take over to somebody's house or something else|user:yeah	that i've	1
agent:ooh that sounds good|user:and that's it you just mix it all together|agent:yeah	and pop it in the oven just to you know heat it through	0
agent:like i told my husband this summer i love to eat you know chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that and|agent:new things like that because|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:so|agent:right|user:and they don't need any added help	when we're here at home	1
agent:and my other one does not so|user:not yet|agent:out about your kids	huh	1
user:oh yeah|agent:[laughter] i've had some from Plano too|user:no that's unusual seems like usually	i think all mine have been East Coast people so far	1
user:does uh|agent:that involves a lot of different areas i think|user:uh	yeah	0
agent:because of the way children are being raised they're not learning the values they need to learn|agent:are having a big effect on the social changes|agent:day care centers and things	yeah	1
agent:rather than that she has to have the money particularly|user:oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the|agent:situations where the woman goes back to work because that's what she wants to do you know	stimulating environment	1
agent:that um|agent:to look at them and watch the way they act and things|agent:it it's really obvious	yeah	1
user:that's right|agent:that's [laughter-right] Prissy get's you in trouble because you can't have them there|agent:that's right [laughter-i] [laughter-remembered]	she does shed a lot of fur	1
agent:all sealed up [laughter] [laughter] yeah i know that's that's the problem with it but um|user:i think Jay would go bananas over that though [laughter-he] he likes for our house to be as secure as possible [laughter]|agent:so that that's nice	um-hum	1
agent:she had done it years ago you know that she had um|agent:yeah it's really you know Barb said she wishes that|user:and it's really neat for people living alone like you say with your friend	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|agent:yeah it was it was very traumatic my sis[ter]- it was really upsetting to my little sister and and um so tha[t]- it just we didn't have many pets growing up just because_1 our house wasn't conducive to that|user:that was traumatic wasn't it yeah	yeah	1
agent:um-hum um-hum|agent:um|user:she's at least thirteen or fourteen we don't know exactly because_1 we got her as a young kitten or a young cat and didn't know that much about her she's a neat cat i mean she owns us all the way	but	1
agent:oh|user:very lightly sedate them so that they sleep a lot and that just gave me the creeps because_1 i you know i|user:and vets and that they all	hate to think they did that to anything or anybody	1
agent:so uh|user:yes|user:yes	well i	1
agent:right|user:and uh Chinese and things and and things of that sort now yes of course we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers [laughter] or something like that too|user:Tex-Mex and Italian	and uh	0
user:tha[t's]- that's one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me|agent:their pastas were great|agent:and uh	i i like different kinds of food	0

agent:that's true|agent:oh oh yeah we i guess we we use the coupons too that's true|agent:oh good	i mean it's wonderful particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that	1
agent:it's nice that they're attentive but it's not nice when they're too attentive|agent:yeah and do the dishes and uh actually it's kind of nice to you know i always uh a waitress or waiter that waits the table [noise]|user:and do the dishes [laughter]	oh yes	1
agent:oh i guess it's in the winter season well they've never had it when we've been back so but uh well you ought to try that it's it's it's very good|agent:and then i guess it must be seasonal and we've been back|agent:which was absolutely wonderful	uh-huh	1
user:and uh Colter's Bar B Q and and uh|user:sometimes we'll go you know we we also go to Chili's|user:and uh	we go to li[ttle]- there is a little	0

user:i've never had any personal|user:yeah the same in some of the areas around here but|agent:yeah i think they have them in Dallas because i hear them talking about in the schools different things happening and they've had some drive-by shootings outside of the schools	you know i never met anybody that i knew had anything to [laughter-do] [laughter-with] [laughter-it]	0

user:you know i- i'm originally from Connecticut and uh i was home a few years ago and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner and|agent:you can't find them like that and|user:you can't find them yeah [noise] yeah yeah yeah	i was really amazed you know the the restaurants up there were kind of quaint you know they were real	1
agent:well|user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	well	0
user:good engineering schools in relatively small towns like|user:he had never really lived in a large town so we looked at|user:uh	Purdue	0
agent:yeah|user:so that was kind of how uh we finally settled on small town and good engineering school with a coop program for him|agent:uh-huh	for Brian	1
user:and|user:to stick a little closer to home|user:Jana i think wanted to	really didn't have a major when she went in in fact	1
agent:we visited there and she visited some because her high school boyfriend's sister was there so she had spent some time there and|agent:but she just uh it was sort of her choice and i think it was a little bit of|agent:not a big deal for her	i see	1
agent:definitely|user:so uh|agent:yeah	he felt a little easier about that after uh after i told him it wouldn't upset me at all if he found something that he wanted to do rather then copy what i did	1
agent:start saying well do you really have to go there to get what you want [laughter]|user:oh i know it|agent:when you start looking at the twenty to thirty thousand dollar price tag and you	that's right	0
agent:it was a real brown area and|user:uh-huh|agent:it was it was quite evident [laughter] that	well i think it would be terrible to live in an area	0
user:i think it gives off|agent:was giving|agent:um	uh in the emissions it gives off gases which	0
user:well it was actually it was put on by the power companies and about the various sources of energy and|user:uh on uh|user:what's interesting several years ago i took a course	how much pollution there was and there wasn't from various kinds of of energy	0
user:from when i took that course now a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear|user:perspective|user:so it's kind of interesting the change in	uh i'm not afraid of nuclear having had that course because of how the nuclear that uh they use	0
user:but uh|user:uh-huh|agent:yeah i i get that sometimes um my line gets some static i don't know why	solar of course would be the clean cleanest	1
agent:yes|user:one of these days because that's perfectly clean|user:[laughter]	it's just we can't control it right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out so	0
agent:yes|user:receptive to ideas about the environment and protecting the earth|user:i've noticed students are are much more you know young young people are much more	and so if we can raise it uh you know generations with those concerns we'll solve a lot of our problems	1
user:and if we you know and if it's not|agent:yeah|user:all right well i guess you know i- i wasn't expecting that question about AIDS so i haven't thought too much about it but i guess i think that we should have more research um i'm just concerned that it's just going to be such a major health problem	i say it would seem to me the sooner we take care of it the better off we're going to be	1
user:w[ell]-|agent:you know at at least they're making progress but they've got to get it stopped they've got to find a cure|agent:so	well i think so too and so i guess i would you know personally i would be really in favor of that now i have had um i have two friends who've died of it	0
agent:right|user:this whole issue of the whole blood issue is very scary|agent:uh-huh	because you know people don't know that's the thing	0
user:uh|user:but|user:i don't know i guess they might	you know i- i would hate to be in a position where i would need a transfusion or my children i think it would be a real scary thing	1
agent:you got it|user:well and i worry you know the older my children get the more expo[sure]- chances of exposure they're going to have|agent:and just say well you know the research is going on is doing good enough because it's not there's no cure yet	i mean i can't imagine well even for you being a single person i mean i think	0
user:well it's just a|user:i know|agent:then we'll talk	it's just a sad thing and	1
agent:they've got to do it because it's it's everywhere|agent:i don't know but|agent:so	well i know and a[nd]- you know and make it available to people	0
agent:he he just oh it was horrible it was horrible|agent:just you name it|agent:um	so he was really susceptible	1
user:well my|agent:yeah and his friend had died the year before|agent:yeah	huh	1
user:one of the reasons that i'm against it is that uh um i'm a[fraid]- afraid of|user:i don't know i c[an't]- think that i|user:well like um	someone losing their life for s[omething]- um wrongly	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:i[t]-|user:well you know that's true because uh m[y]- but a lot of um these [laughter-conversations] i've had on this program this	these telephone conversations have revolved around um	1
user:uh|user:you know i just recently moved to Massachusetts i'm not sure what their policy is on capital punishment and that was one of the questions but|user:that's true	i do know that they are	0
agent:so she tried to enter her number and it wouldn't work so she said whew it's for you so|user:oh oh i see|user:handed it to you [laughter]	[laughter]	1
agent:i don't see you know that to me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for|agent:and|user:um-hum	that's right	1
agent:yeah|agent:right|user:or somebody's test get mixed up with somebody else's i mean those things do happen	uh i certainly wouldn't want people's lives	0
user:to me|user:uh|agent:right	it's to me it's not an invasion of privacy i think it's people have a right to know if if uh their	1
agent:hum|user:um-hum|agent:get the same effect	course i feel the same way on the AIDS problem	1
agent:we live in a town uh near a town called Temple|agent:and i'm i'm down in the the central but i don't know how familiar you are with Texas but i'm in a|user:uh-huh	um	1
agent:how about that|agent:wow|agent:hum	so	0
agent:one of the things i found interesting it it's funny that you mentioned that TI is pretty much a worldwide company and we have manufacturing plants|user:you know there's a lot of people that think there's nothing wrong with|user:objecting	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:yeah but like if you're going to do business in another country you've got to respect their rules i mean if if you know that's that's the trade off i guess|agent:right|user:whether it was legal or not it it would have to affect you the same way	um-hum	1
agent:so that's|user:yeah|agent:yeah	so	1
user:a g[ood]- good feel for maybe what's good jazz and what's not but|user:g[ood]- good understanding of it or a good|user:i guess i enjoy i enjoy jazz listening to jazz sometime although i don't feel like i have a good	but um i enjoy it and uh	1
agent:yeah|agent:[laughter]|user:oh gosh Chris Xeros [laughter] you grew up with his children too then	oh gosh	0
agent:it was really nice so|user:oh|agent:yeah they just had the baby's christening so	was it a boy or a girl	1
agent:yeah we've heard them and|user:yeah|agent:yes	yeah	1
agent:no no no no no just by itself just by itself|user:but you didn't have oboe or something with it|user:well i mean	oh	0
agent:i don't know the way it vibrates it's kind of haunting you know on on some of the notes it it's i'd i like it|agent:it r[eally]- really does and it it has such a different sound to it anyway it's almost|agent:it does	oh	1
agent:so|user:oh|user:probably	gosh	1
agent:yeah|user:and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning|user:to the piano when i hear it at other places or when i you know see some see and hear someone playing i sort of watch their technique too and	so it's been fun	1
agent:uh|user:oh my God|agent:upstairs into intensive care to see the baby and they were doing surgery on the baby and she didn't even know they were going to do surgery on the baby	what a terrible thing for her to go through	1
agent:and an Indian doctor that she couldn't understand|agent:uh in his late seventies|agent:that had one gentleman that was uh	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:i don't know some ache or pain or just how they you know reply um uh if they're going to be good or not the doctor that will sit down and talk to you and that will you know do things like that uh|agent:give him|agent:and get feel on you know you can usually tell if you go to a doctor and if you	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:okay|agent:[noise]	[noise]	1
user:uh i look at our big green containers and i say well they work fine and i keep mine outside the garage|user:convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is|user:we've gotten so	so that i don't have any odors but	0
user:growing up in rural South Dakota where|user:uh|user:you saw back uh years ago but for me the thing that strikes me is i	hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery	1
agent:you could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed and so you just put the empty ones back out there and he took them away and put you know put another gallon of glass glass bottle in there|user:uh-huh|agent:in glass bottles and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house	yeah	1
agent:right|user:uh taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans|user:yeah well i'll have to say i'm i'm the only one i'm good at at this point is the newspaper	uh getting rid of those but on the plastic i have uh	1
agent:uh the small Coke bottles|agent:do you know i saw in Tom Thumb yesterday i saw the return to the|agent:right	yeah	1
user:y[ou]- you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do we were doing and we had all the mechanisms in place|user:well i mean the|user:yeah	with the fold up paper cartons the wood	0
user:uh|user:yeah i'm the i'm the same way because otherwise|agent:no he doesn't like the paper sacks and uh but he but you know he likes to pick the grass up too he doesn't doesn't just	oh i'm	0
user:so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it|user:uh composts or stores and uh|user:just build a big mound of it and it naturally	and it will naturally decompose	0
agent:[noise]	[noise]	0
agent:oh i haven't seen that one yet|agent:so|user:uh-huh i- i saw uh Sleeping with the Enemy oh	um i saw it uh oh couple weeks ago i rented it and um	1
agent:well it was it was an amusing movie it j[ust]- i guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater [noise] as opposed to uh [noise] at the house watching it with|agent:did she|agent:unfortu[nately]-	um-hum	1
user:uh-huh|agent:oh i haven't i didn't hear that was coming out|user:and there's some i think there's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video um Shipwrecked	yeah it's fixing to come out on video and	0
agent:and uh someone said that was a lot of fun to go do you can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie i thought that might be kind of fun to do|user:uh-huh|agent:um-hum [laughter] that seems to happen i noticed that Dances With Wolves was playing at the uh Granada Theater	yeah that does sound fun	1
agent:yeah that's the one [laughter]|user:oh okay|agent:um-hum	okay yeah	0
user:and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as|user:a topic that's gonna probably take about a generation to uh catch on it seems or maybe a generation to two|agent:[noise]	moving that time schedule up but it does seem to be a lot of habits to break	0
user:to get a garbage sack full we just don't drink that many so as far as at home use uh we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion|user:[noise] almost a year|user:and we it took us um	of Dr Pepper or something and and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in	0
agent:told you to separate everything|agent:uh i'm not sure all what we're gonna have to do whether we have three separate containers i really don't understand that part on what they've|user:hm	right	0
agent:i- i- i know other places when they recycle they have to like wash out their glass jars and whatnot|user:yeah yeah|agent:well it'd get messy too	right	1
agent:[noise] so that's the main reason we're we uh sort of are into cans [laughter-at] [laughter-this] point rather than the liter [laughter-bottles]|user:right yep|agent:and then have it go flat	where do you take your cans	1
user:uh-huh|agent:[noise] communism is no more|agent:and everything there we lived our whole life under the fear of communism was going to get us and now	so it	1
agent:i'm not sure i|agent:since i you know first started|user:uh-huh	huh	1
user:and i [laughter-think] that uh [laughter] like they're all um|user:like uh my sister's younger than i am|agent:hum	uh well of course there's AIDS and i don't have to guess why you know because_1	0
agent:even ten years ago before the threat of AIDS entered|user:uh-huh|agent:five years ago	uh-huh	1
agent:i think they're going to pull back and we may find the pendulum swings you know|user:uh-huh|agent:uh i think they're going to pull back sexually	the other way	1
agent:yeah|user:yeah [laughter] i guess that's why i thought [laughter-of] [laughter-it]|agent:are in the midst of this	and uh	1
agent:um-hum um-hum|agent:it gets boring|user:after a while cross stitch i th[ink]- i don't know i have to put it away and then i have to bring it back you know	and	0
agent:oh i bet but it's such a lost art|agent:um-hum|user:long it's very tedious if you don't have a whole group you're not finishing a quilt in a long [laughter-time]	so uh	1
agent:really|user:because_1 if you could knit you could crochet it's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to|user:well i was gonna say because_1	to to weave the the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand	0
agent:um-hum|user:and a lot of people don't do that either|user:and i- i just think that um that's one of one of the arts that i think are real pretty	you know	0
user:and that's nice and everything|agent:ooh that d[oes]-|user:you know i like to sketch i can i can sketch something like if i see a picture like out of a book i can sketch that	but you know it's funny i can't	0

user:per let's say afflicted person|user:as much|user:the rumor i'm not really sure if it's true or not that uh we're not spending	on cancer uh there's some uh take breast cancer for instance it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more peo[ple]- mean more people than AIDS	0
agent:[laughter]|user:i i kind of i thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing but then i go[t]- i got to thinking|user:[noise] well	the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and there's only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood an[tigen]- antigen uh [vocalized-noise] antibody test for the antigen in the blood and that's fairly recent and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years	1
agent:all the sudden it's the most important thing|agent:so serious you know i mean it's not so serious i guess until it affects your family and then|agent:you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because_1 they're all	right	1
user:we have such an affluent -[s]ociety society that i wonder if if we|user:uh it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good i mean yeah they're kind of nice but|user:uh in our economy or in our system	took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a	0
user:such as uh you've got cases right now that are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read|user:you know the jury especially if it's a highly publicized case|user:uh sentencing in into their hands versus	uh certain uh things in regards to cases like the Dahmer case in Milwaukee and stuff so it's it may be an idea to think about	0
agent:[noise] Supreme Supreme Court decision perhaps that said that uh that uh as part of the trial by the peers that i had to include the sentencing or|agent:uh i gue[ss]- i guess [noise] uh and i don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some|agent:yeah and	changes	1
agent:yeah yeah|user:uh just basically with a judge guilty or not guilty verdict|user:kind of how i you knows in certain cases i can see them going uh	uh simply from a judge	0
agent:yeah|user:and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay i know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work or at lea[st]- give them the time off from work|agent:yeah	uh whether it i think it's with pay if	0
user:oh yeah|agent:taking care of children|user:and uh cleaning and all that good stuff	oh actually the children they they don't have as many children these days	1
agent:it was so limiting because of their clothes they weren't allowed to to wear certain things and so then they couldn't par[ticipate]- you know they couldn't participate in sports because of it|agent:i thought well|user:um-hum	uh-huh	1
agent:and that's always been amazing to me|agent:how short a time it's been since the women had the vote|agent:it's an interesting topic i the thing that's been hard for me to believe too is that how l[ong]-	um-hum	1
agent:uh may men may stay home with children better than some women may and so whoever|agent:[noise] well i think that you know that one of the things that may come out of this is to let people do what they're best at you know some people|user:and well i don't wanna talk about the husband's changing roles but they're all they're learning to cook now and to do the laundry and uh all of those good things	um-hum	1
agent:i thought it was good as a matter of fact um|agent:yes|user:uh-huh what do you think about that	uh-huh	1

agent:but you don't have anything right now|user:no i- i used to have fish when i was a kid|agent:and and so you have fish or do you have	but i don't have anything now i i guess when i moved out of my parent's house i uh gave my fish to my friends and fish tank i think i gave to someone else	0
agent:but um down here i haven't fished much in Texas|user:uh-huh|agent:a a little fresh water fish but mostly lake fishing like rainbow trout and stuff because i used to live in Utah	that's one of the few things i've ever fished for is rainbow trout	1
agent:oh how about_1 that|agent:right|agent:uh-huh	so yeah you just leave it at that level and in no time something would hit it and you could pull them_1 up two and three times in a row but you had to find out what level how many cranks they were off the bottom	0
agent:no i don't|user:yeah well if you do you have any friends with ponds|user:uh-huh	i um well if you can fi[nd]- well oh even a lake if uh seems like every time somebody's on the bank all they wanna do is throw it out just as far as they can	0
agent:uh-huh|user:it's a real small repala it's about an inch and a half long and they're pure sil[ver]- all silver something real shiny about that long|user:and uh the the other thing that's real good is small um	they'll go after that in a heartbeat also just anything that really shines or spins	1
user:ooh that sounds good what|agent:and i fixed uh a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy it's uh it's like uh eight ounces of cream cheese softened and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice one tablespoon Worcester sauce|user:uh-huh	um-hum	1
user:ooh that sounds|agent:i think i just served it by itself there's like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff|agent:uh what did i put it in	i've tried it and then i have it here on hand for about a week and all of a sudden it dawned on me wait is this totally imitation	0
user:and then you can refreeze|agent:yes it is frozen and i thaw it and then you -[c]an refreeze it and uh-huh it was they're very good very good and that's the one thing that i|user:so you can uh it is frozen isn't it	hey that sounds great that s[ounds]-	1
user:i spend an awful lot of [laughter-time]|user:uh|user:uh well since i initiated the call i guess i'll start off first uh number one i have absolutely no problem with random testing	traveling on the job and i feel [noise]	0
agent:um|user:and i am pushing towards that i- i honestly feel if people have nothing to hide|user:so i it's very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause this type of thing [noise] and even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs and we at the present time do not have random testing	they shouldn't have a problem with it	0
agent:in my opinion i i've had a lot of dental work done and the last dentist i went to didn't even use gloves at all so|user:yes|user:um-hum	oh really	1
user:and i think they've had it for several years and their program they had i don't think had a lot of uh|agent:uh-huh|user:well you where you're located i- i do know Texas Instruments has random drug testing	problems	0

user:nice long skiing career but now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me i've|user:and it it was a nice uh|user:realm where he was living underneath the dock and uh managed to get up didn't go very far but i got up	i've uh	0
user:i don't have anybody to teach me either that's another little thing you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do but just from what i've seen you just kind of w[ork]-|user:yeah it it'd be kind of nice i hadn't quite figured out|agent:that sounds like a real challenge	work your way up to it and turn around real quick [laughter-you] [laughter-know] grab the rope behind you and then just l[et]- let go real quick and let it whip you around	0
user:use only|user:major credit cards that we have and uh use uh|user:ours are just	when	0

agent:the float for more than a hundred dollars seems real nice for that|user:um-hum|agent:even if we have the i'm sure we'd have the cash before we got it but	sure	1
user:and so you know we always|user:yeah|agent:[laughter] we'll give you five thousand dollars up front [laughter]	laugh about that because it's quite a bit i mean you know you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff so	1

agent:be excited about all of it|agent:yes|user:well and with a daughter nine it is just she's old enough to really grasp the meaning behind	uh i[f]- so uh well if you're working then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go	1
agent:um-hum|user:and presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles|agent:uh-huh	and so i've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets because we have a lot of flying with Continental	0
user:now we did what we sometimes do since we are in Ohio and it takes a while just to even get to|agent:right|user:that would be excellent	the	0
user:the budget seems to be|agent:[noise]	oh on a number of people's minds and often times when peoples talk about	0
user:our base here or we want whatever|user:you wish you know you would say well you're not acting right we're gonna withhold it or you're not doing this that or the other or we want|user:uh system is uh used to it and then you threaten with whatever	and the government's been doing that for years and will probably continue to do that for years and i'm not sure if the general public uh	1

user:we wanted air conditioning and|user:when we were looking we were looking for something had enough seat belts of course and|user:well i don't think we're looking for another car right now because_1 we just bought one but	a five speed and that was kind of iffy but that made it better economically	0
agent:that's right so if we wanted it to take people out with it that's a good thought i|user:it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes so|user:yeah it	[laughter]	0
agent:do they feel that way|user:the company doing drugs|user:vast majority of the people at	um i think that they thought that there was a lot of	0
user:right i|user:[noise]|user:right	at TI if you get called in and you test positive for drugs then you're put on a program	0

user:if if|agent:well if they're not reporting the income now they're still not paying it so what's the point|user:well your problem in there is how do you get i mean you get people that don't report income now so if they don't report income then you wouldn't get that percentage	well if if it's left in the hands of the grocer he doesn't care whether you know this guy giving him the money	0
agent:i never have understood why they don't do that|agent:yeah|user:yeah you tax per body and and then if you made more you got to keep more yeah that's a rational way to do it	yeah it it does seem	1

user:small residential area and we're out of the|user:yeah i think as far as like our home is uh in a|agent:in uh Texas so	cities quite a ways so	0
agent:um-hum|user:from that distance there's still homes within our area that are you know pretty typical of what our home is so it's uh pretty much that uh|user:where we can view the river	type of um home so	0
agent:yeah we have two two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen and the bedrooms are a little bit small except the master bedroom's a little bigger|user:so it's a rambler style|agent:um but we	um-hum	1
agent:oh have you|agent:uh-huh|user:the TI um yes uh about three times a[nd]- so i'm fairly new to it but	it seems to be going okay	1
agent:[laughter] basically about the same as what you've probably had|user:[noise] okay how's the weather been in Plano [laughter]|agent:[noise]	r[ight]- [laughter] yeah this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city	0
agent:the thing the other thing is the i don't like the rain either|user:and i wish it were several months of that|agent:yeah yeah	[noise] well i don't either unless it's like	0
user:yes i do not like the [laughter-humidi[ty]-]|agent:oh is that right [laughter] well another reason well i guess i can't say that it|user:but i agree with you the humidity especially for curly heads like me	[noise]	1
agent:it's just too hot|user:i do too and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of|user:well i do too	negative on it but then we started thinking especially in Plano the weather is so hot in August	0
agent:and me too because i eat out a lot|user:[noise] all right this is easy for me since i|agent:[noise]	yeah [laughter] well i travel i do about forty percent of my time is on the road [noise]	1
agent:oh Houston's uh-huh|user:um there's two restaurants that i particularly like that i eat every time i get into Texas or i get into Atlanta Georgia i make sure i go and that's Houston's|user:uh [noise] [noise] down near uh Addison	yep okay [noise]	0
agent:um-hum|user:you know and i know the locations and i know the places but i lot of times i don't remember the names i'd have to go back through some expense reports|agent:[noise]	[noise] but	0
agent:it's F S it's S F U Z I|user:okay let i'm i'm writing it [laughter-down]|agent:that has a great i've not been there but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in Dallas and now there's one in Addison	okay	1
user:[noise] true|agent:when i went i thought the people drove me crazy first of all|agent:see i	true	1
agent:so that's that's a very good place to eat The Blue Mesa Grill|user:um-hum|agent:it's great i mean they're they have i think sometimes i've been when i thought well it wasn't as good but i went there recently and i thought well this really is good	good	1
agent:the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore|agent:sent my grandfather to a nursing home at|agent:we	uh-huh	1
user:yes|agent:yeah yeah that's important i'd say|user:that she could have what was called an independent living facility she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and TV set so	and that the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days	0
agent:things just went too far|agent:this eventually|agent:and	yeah	1
agent:yeah this is a great topic for me because_1 i just did my first two painting projects ever it was not not a big deal|user:[noise] so have you done any painting projects lately|agent:[noise]	[laughter]	1
agent:that i needed that i mean i kind of knew in the back of my mind|user:uh-huh|agent:didn't realize that we didn't have any uh turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house so i had it had it all over my hands at first i didn't realize you know i had never painted anything so i didn't realize	so you can't use oil on wood	1
user:and uh an[d]- the one of the real strict uh restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and|user:day care center|user:she just started up a	lead free and all that other good stuff	0
user:but uh you just took a roller and put it on there|agent:yeah|user:and uh i had this big five gallon jug and it was like paint thinner i mean i you know it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner	and uh if you saw that the wood was getting wet you know that was that was all you needed so	0
agent:yeah if you just [noise] you know we didn't tape anything|agent:well|user:a a time saver	[laughter]	1
agent:[noise]	[noise]	1
agent:wow|agent:wow|user:oh i oh uh jeez i think over um three hundred were there it was quite a large	it was a great big lodge	0
agent:oh wow that's wonderful that's wonderful|agent:uh-huh uh-huh|user:like Nevada Arizona i think like that and	yeah so it's been fun how about_1 you	1
agent:and do they they have a hotel or where do you stay|user:um|agent:yeah yeah yeah	um basically they just stay with each other brothers or sisters there are enough in the area to to just kind of span yourself out	0
agent:oh wow|agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh	yeah and um the thing is that um	1
agent:where my fam[ily]- my in-laws are|user:ah|user:yes	oh we've been there we haven't skied at Broadmoor we went there last year at Christmas time and it was twenty seven below	0
user:yes|agent:to go to Disney World but we have two little ones that are under two right now so we wanna wait until they're a little bit older|user:uh-huh	oh	0
agent:wow|user:and we left a day early [noise] and they put us up at the Cocoa Beach Hilton and the ship that was available the only uh rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites|user:we really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise so they said we could either cancel reschedule or take whatever was available so we took whatever was available	so we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin	1
agent:so when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do so we don't we don't get a lot of time to just vacation we did um|user:yes|agent:oh well we like to ski of course so we spend so much time with our families uh and seeing our friends because_1 we moved to Texas about two years ago	yeah	1
agent:oh do you live where do you what state are you in|user:we will probably be going up at Thanksgiving this year so|agent:[noise]	Texas	1
agent:yeah um-hum and then we go straight up through Trinidad and|user:287 or something like that|user:that's on like Route	okay	1
agent:because she could receive more medical attention|user:oh|agent:she uh she was just more or less in a in a nursing home for uh recovery from a broken hip	yes	1
agent:um-hum|user:and i think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly|agent:uh-huh	if they didn't have to you know go into a kitchen	1
agent:i think|user:oh i think so t[oo]-|agent:i think that they should be able to interact with other people i[n]- in an environment that they choose if they can if the family can afford it	well	1
user:and we realized that how it would [distrupt/disrupt] disrupt our travel routine and things like that|user:and i should be in a pretty good position because_1 i don't have little kids any more that i need sitters for or anything like that if i go to work it would be for our fun money|user:and well easily just [laughter-as] [laughter-you] [laughter-said] and i sat down and thought about it	and my husband gets five weeks vacation and we said it's not worth it i'm not working any more	0
agent:true true|user:uh sales tax which is good|agent:true	as uh the income tax what's not fair	0
user:that's what i understand uh this one seemed to do well and uh she did go over our last three or four years and she said i have to compliment [laughter-you] you have excelled she said i cannot find one thing to pull out that you haven't already pulled and i said well i do keep records|agent:and yet if you went to visit five different CPA's you'd get five different answers|user:but this last time it was so involved that i just threw it all up and said forget it let's go see a CPA well	all year long as i go	0
agent:oh [laughter] right and so many people work nowadays there you know there's not that many kids in a neighborhood necessarily anymore either|user:exactly so the exercise we can pretty much uh get from her uh she always wants to go outside and do things so i'm kind of uh she's an only child too so it's it's not like you can say go out and play with other kids so it's|user:yeah	[noise]	1
agent:do walk i feel so much better you know when i get out and do that two miles it takes about thirty minutes just our neighborhood is just kind of very flat land with sidewalks and|agent:um-hum i will admit though when i|user:also takes into account of walking though when you think about it so it ah	oh sure	1
user:uh-huh|agent:trip [laughter-for] [laughter-three] [laughter-days] [laughter-and] [laughter-left] [laughter-them] [laughter-with] [laughter-us]|user:uh-huh	so oh boy	1
agent:it also made me think of one other thing walking|user:so|agent:[laughter-right] uh when you were talking about mentally losing sleep	um-hum	1
user:then they'll pay you a certain amount of money|user:um anyway uh i know here in here in Plano some of the things that we do are um Kroger and some of the other stores too have said if you bring your bags back to uh to the store to recycle|agent:yeah	and that's one thing that started in the community	1
agent:right|user:the can different can banks around the city|user:so um that's always helpful [noise] and i know that we ha[ve]- we have the the can	that you can go to and do that	0
agent:yeah i think they already do that out east um they have to it's a little bit more difficult because people have to remember okay today's glass okay tomorrow's plastic and all that but i think that's the way we need to go it's uh it's pretty bad all these years we've been|user:to put like either glass or newspapers or whatever|user:colored can to put them_1 in or or something in the city	yeah	1
user:so|agent:yeah about six months ago i started and yeah and uh so what i do is uh|agent:[laughter]	did you	0
agent:what they need or what they're taking all that i've just read a lot about it and i'm keeping these big [laughter-piles] [laughter-of] [laughter-it] [laughter-right] [laughter-now] to try to dump it out this weekend in fact|agent:but uh i haven't been down to the recycling center yet to find out exactly|user:right right	[laughter]	1
agent:well i'm i'm at home also so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary but uh|agent:i see|agent:[laughter]	no do you actually follow a budget	0
agent:yeah|user:and uh they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to|user:and then i have another one but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point we're in a new home	so i'm still getting used to that but we make sure that we just do not	0
agent:that's right [laughter]|agent:[laughter]|user:and so everybody's saying you're kidding you have two cars the [laughter-same] and i said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again [laughter]	i said well we had one and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it	0
EMPTY	[noise]	1
user:[laughter]|agent:i would love to just take some scissors and cut them_1 in half|user:um-hum	yeah me too [laughter]	1
agent:wow|user:i mean i- i think like half [noise] of the amount that they cost in the first place|user:and we still owe	it's just uh you know you just never never get	0
user:um [noise] so we didn't ever made that mistake again luckily [noise] but uh we're|agent:[noise] oh|agent:[laughter]	definitely working on not doing that credit thing we just as a matter of fact this it's real interesting the subjects i get they always seem to be so pertinent but we just discussed this last night at church	1
agent:[noise] oh dear|user:[laughter] sure that's true oh i just picked up my daughter and she was eating a cupcake and there are crumbs all over|user:[noise] yep	her yeah	1
agent:oh okay i'm from New York|user:from Pennsylvania|agent:[noise] hi how you doing Doug my name's Brad whe[re]- where you from	yeah	0
user:that and if that can be done it shouldn't|user:and|user:whether you're able to do the job up to par	matter	0
user:probably not as good workers i think that most drug testing programs don't include that|agent:sure|user:a lot are	they're	0
user:uh right exactly it's on the radio|user:yeah|agent:oh okay a little tribute to him or [laughter]	um	0
user:okay|agent:i'll let you go ahead and start yeah|user:did you want me to go ahead	well one thing i- i- i guess both of us have very much aware of the equality	0
agent:yeah|user:even you know even more so i think it's just gonna be|user:a neat thing to see as far as equality in the households and i think that's even gonna get better	where men will do as much cleaning as women do	0
user:as long as you|agent:yeah|user:you can be whatever you want to be and whether it be a welder a trucker or [laughter-whatever]	uh go to school for it and get the education so	1
user:what i've learned in uh just just|user:i- i think that's [vocalized-noise] the gap is coming closer [vocalized-noise] as um|agent:that's right [noise]	being out there it seems that	0
agent:one of the frustrations that i have with the way things have developed is that|user:take care of the uh money making and it it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that|agent:[noise]	um-hum	1
user:the things that came across you know they said to make it memorable memorable but i thought first of all you needed to|user:[laughter] okay|user:you'd organize	kind of about the same time every year like the same week of the the same month	0
user:also like at Christmas time it'd be a dinner reunion|user:um|user:some have had breakfast and lunch and it's been a whole day affair some [noise] of course just have lunch or	and	0
user:where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend and you put the cash in envelopes|agent:um-hum|user:well that's a lot of it uh i know we tried several different ways one time we tried something that really worked but we didn't keep it up i passed it on to a friend and she won't quit doing it she loves it and that was the envelope system	marked for that so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries and et cetera	0
user:right|user:right|agent:no because if you charge things and uh you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid or you get paid the last day or next to the last day you pay all your bills then there isn't anything left to spend anyway	well that's true	0
user:um|agent:and for most of uh i mean i'm a substitute teacher and i've only substituted i guess for the last fifteen years so there's only been really one working [noise] and uh [noise]|user:that's right	um-hum same here yeah	1
user:yeah yeah|user:do you|user:it's kind of hard	right [laughter] right	1
agent:well we never had too much of that but then we never had any really emergencies that uh|agent:um-hum|user:and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get [laughter] you know	yeah	1
agent:and um the closest thing we have are bins like out in front of Wal-Mart|user:uh-huh|agent:as of yet uh we're pretty small town	oh uh-huh	1
agent:oh|user:you know all those things that [vocalized-noise] aluminum you know anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin|user:and um	and uh i guess you can al[so]- and a lot of the restaurants	0
user:[noise]|agent:yeah see it's not anywhere near that uh we uh you know as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans|user:yeah things of that nature so i guess when you live in a bigger city it it really becomes uh necessary	oh yeah	1
user:and uh they try to get you to go ahead and separate it but uh they actually have the door to door pickup|agent:[noise] yeah|user:of course there you know you have a specific place to put your paper	um and it's uh i think it started out to be um	1
agent:yeah|user:recycled paper is actually very expensive [laughter]|user:um-hum well the thing about newspapers and paper	so when you see something that's on recycled paper they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that	0
agent:we look forward to it to get better but that's it|user:uh-huh|agent:you know beginning stages so	well i hope y'all um uh come along a little farther in the future	1
user:and we planned a family reunion this spring|agent:i[t]-|user:well i come from a very small family	um where we are from Texas and my family's from Ohio and we met in Florida	1
agent:tho[se]- those are lovely|user:yeah|agent:yes you're in the the styles that they have started building in the last couple years with the real high ceilings and uh-huh	yeah the the one thing we did do instead of having a twenty foot living room ceiling we're from the north and we just couldn't stand the wasted space so we had them_1 we have a high entry hall and then we had them level off our living room and dining room ceiling	0
agent:where did you move from|agent:right|user:yeah we're we're really proud of it i just hope we never have to move again this is [laughter-ou[r]-]	uh Detroit this last time	0
user:oh|agent:you know it is with huh withstood you know two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it all the time so and we like our neighborhood it it has has grown and the majority of the people you know keep up the neighborhood|user:yes	yes	1
agent:that keeps the prices down|user:yes|agent:there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs and everything so that's you know	yeah	1
agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum|user:uh a lot if anything	and so she asks the same questions over and over again	0
agent:they they just well they can't take the proper care of them_1 most of them|agent:they're in Missouri and i could i- i know i know stories for sure that they just|agent:so	yeah	1
agent:they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the uh|agent:but i think you'd have to really|user:yeah	nursing homes	1
agent:right|agent:um-hum|user:some are good i have to say that but for the most part	i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children	1
user:now i know a friend of mine who had a father|agent:right|user:that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment	um she brought to her home	0
agent:oh yes cockroaches are awful here just awful [noise] so i|user:do they really|agent:oh roaches and	oh	1
user:too much|user:as far as the gardening and things like that goes i don't know uh|user:but um	too much about uh	0
agent:yes|user:[noise] yeah are you there|agent:[noise]	okay	0
user:and up there if they miss three elections|user:i'm originally from Oklahoma|user:i[t]- [laughter] i have worked in some campaigns and it's the most discouraging thing in the world	then they have to reregister and i have often wondered if if maybe that would help the situation i don't know	1
user:but i'm gonna vote each time|user:i don't know why we are so complacent|user:it is um	right or wrong i'm gonna cast a ballot and then if i'm unhappy with it i have the right to express my opinion	1
user:and um course those can be they can be|agent:um-hum|user:you have to [vocalized-noise] you have to skip three	oh a long time apart but um	1
user:but this idea of anyone we[ll]- i ju[st]- i am so bitterly opposed to this|agent:um-hum|user:and that would i could live with	if you're busy that has always been a legitimate excuse	0
agent:because_1 she's pretty senile and [laughter]|agent:should we put her in or|agent:um [noise] like we i mean we've had those discussions you know about	and it ta[kes]- it takes a lot of care like twenty four hours a day someone	0
agent:have like a little toilet right by her bed [vocalized-noise] it's and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so|agent:uh i don't know [vocalized-noise] i don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to|agent:so it's kind of	uh-huh	1

user:but um|agent:yes|user:or something like that now but	you know i've i've seen a lot of Julia Roberts movies	1
user:besides that i think uh two things that very definitely need looking at one is foreign aid|user:and the other thing is uh|agent:right	[noise] i have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that	0
user:well|agent:but|user:[noise] yeah they don't they don't seem to	i really think the biggest problem and then the Taft Rudman Act is supposed to help that the biggest part is they have no accountability for what they're doing	0
agent:[vocalized-noise] [laughter] oh|user:it's sort of like our mortgages i don't ever expect to pay mine off before i die so i guess [laughter-why] [laughter-should] [laughter-the] [laughter-government] [laughter-try]|user:[noise] yeah i don't know what we're gonna be able to do about it but i guess it's been around so long that	[laughter] isn't that's the way they're thinking these days anyway	1
agent:totally get even more out of control but i [noise] i don't know|agent:well that that's quite possible i guess we have to have to keep plugging away a little bit or it'll just|user:[noise]	yeah bite the bullet it sounds like you have a baby there	1

agent:constant fighting you know and|agent:and i think there's a certain mentality to that that's in the Middle East you know that's this|agent:or whatever	right	0
user:yeah|agent:uh-huh [noise] that's probably a bonus on our part [noise] yes it is|agent:[noise]	i think i think that they're s[o]- they're so much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support	0
user:and they have to negotiate|agent:yeah|agent:[noise]	almost everything and then you think to yourself well you know in your heart you don't want to be aligned with somebody that's mean and cruel to someone else	0
user:right|agent:especially not a federal prison|user:you know unless they really make it rough on them_1 that's not a going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i don't think	well i don't know what the Oklahoma's laws are but Texas is	0
agent:but i do believe it should be befitting the crime|agent:you know i i won't say sparingly|agent:well it should be given	i do too and and you know but the way the courts are set up they've they've got so many chances for appeal	0

agent:yes|user:LA or somewhere|user:the Herald is owned i think by the Times out of uh	but	1

agent:um-hum|user:and one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible|user:lot of friends that we have they have a tendency to do the same thing	although it really is very easy to do that type of thing just plop them down in front of the TV	0
agent:you know you got some cartoons and that was it but they they were never that interested in it anyway they'd rather i mean they'd take their trucks out in the [laughter-backyard] you know go out and play and stuff but|user:um-hum|agent:other than that i mean there was basically there was not educational TV or uh	right	1

user:[laughter]|agent:oh okay well no see i've got two children and uh they're one's uh just turned to be a teenager and the other one is on his way so [laughter] i uh i'm a single parent so i think it makes it more difficult for me to|agent:[noise]	uh-huh	1
agent:oh yeah oh yeah see i have a son and uh you know it's football in the fall and and baseball in the spring and and it's one activity after another i i'm constantly going back and forth and|user:little boys do all of those things but|agent:um-hum um-hum	uh-huh	1

agent:yeah there's [noise] although i'll tell you you know over the years the cars get more complicated and|user:things to th[e]- the car themselves|agent:yeah	well that's why i don't do as much as i'd like	1
agent:yes|user:alternator you know and starter|user:do i could always do the	i don't anymore but i have on a lo[t]- a lot of times	1
agent:were able to get running uh kind of oiling it and playing with it and the other one they just it was just frozen solid th[e]- so i ended up having to|user:[noise]|agent:so they ended up having to pound it out and one of them_1 they	um-hum	1
agent:and do a f[ine]- you know [vocalized-noise] good a job as i can do but they'll uh lube too [noise]|agent:in ten minutes|user:that's true	right that tha[t]- i've i've quit doing that myself	1
agent:oh|user:and now it's election time again so they're trying to lower them_1|agent:[laughter]	so they're just talk about lowering them_1 but they never do they just keep raising them_1	1
agent:right|user:well they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make|agent:i mean i'm talking about the really rich	that'd be fair	1
agent:but you know if you have a lot of federal deduction it ends up hurting you {statewise}|user:yeah|agent:right unless you have a lot of deductions	really	1
user:i think they're honest when they go in they just keep|user:none of them are honest but|agent:[noise]	facing these challenges and not all of them respond favorably to them	1
agent:yeah|user:the two homes and all of the other things even though they have a high salary|user:yeah and of course he runs into a problem he may not can support	but	1
user:hm|agent:it's been a real eye-opener to us course i feel that he's completely honest and|user:um-hum	yes	1
agent:yeah that's probably true too|user:somebody else in so they've got to find something wrong with whoever's there|user:yeah they want	hm	1
agent:say you know i know this man on a personal basis i know he has integrity and i know he|agent:get to know any of those people well enough to|agent:congressman or something like that i don't know how you would ever	um-hum	1
user:yeah|agent:well that would be nice if we could do that|user:calling them accountable from a a law standpoint	well i know uh some of them_1 the Senate Ethics Committee is trying to do that	0
agent:so that was|agent:uh|agent:i didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate	hm	1
user:um-hum|agent:well they uh i went we went around my son was a graduated from a Jesuit high school and so he he was pretty much looking for a Jesuit university and so there were you know that was limited to|user:listen to your uh guidance counselors and	um-hum	1
agent:year down here and then decide what she's gonna do next year it'll save me a lot of money because_1 i'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition but again that's her decision|agent:she'll finish down here um um finish this|agent:so uh you know she's already twenty one she started late so that's you know strictly up to her and uh	yeah	1
user:um-hum|agent:my son is in a school about seven thousand and that's that's not bad i teach in a school about eight thousand and that's that's even a little large but it's much [laughter-better] than twenty one thousand|agent:and um it was twenty five hundred when i went there forty years ago and uh	yes	1
agent:from what i understand they act up pretty bad [laughter]|agent:yeah yeah|user:these days in the classroom	yeah [noise] that's right	0
user:all sorts of|user:um|agent:um-hum	lawsuits i'm sure because of things like that	1
agent:[laughter]|agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh	you know i don't know your feelings toward that i guess we shouldn't get into that but	0
agent:hm|agent:um-hum|user:you know to be m[ore]- be more careful of the teachers that we place in our schools	um	0
agent:no of course i use credit cards i have a couple of credit cards and|user:you don't use any credit cards i don't imagine|agent:sure	[laughter] yeah yeah	1
agent:oh yeah well that's that's a good thing because lot of people don't pay at the end of the month and they just pay the minimum required balance|user:he likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month [laughter]|agent:uh-huh	he he likes doing that	1
agent:that's true|user:well sometimes you do come on bargains and that and it's really useful|user:right	and some places won't take you know like a personal check or cash even	0
user:right|agent:yes because you make the deduction at the time of the purchase and and so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill|user:to me they are anyways	right yeah	1
agent:um-hum um um-hum|agent:um-hum|user:yeah because sometimes uh there's times when you may maybe couldn't take advantage of something but with a credit card you can	so	1
user:almost too much so|agent:yes|agent:um-hum	but i re[ally]- i really don't like it the charges they you know	1
agent:well especially uh you since you're in the same metroplex you know there's so much going on here|user:they say what aspect are you worried about well i think at this point i for one am worried about every [laughter-aspect]|user:yeah okay well back to crime i guess we're supposed to talk about that	i think the drive by shootings are getting s[o]- be so common that's really a something you got to protect yourself from you know	1
agent:i [laughter-know] i know it's it's it's getting it's been out of hand i think for a while and it just continues to get worse|user:[noise] uh yeah it's kind of scary to think you send your child to school and you wonder if he's gonna get shot i mean [laughter-we] [laughter-never] [laughter-had] [laughter-to] worry about that before|user:so	[laughter] what next	1
agent:um-hum|user:my mother well she's like seventy four now or she when she was a young girl she had a beautiful beautiful cousin that lived in California|agent:uh-huh	and she was dating this millionaire's son and he wanted to marry her and she wouldn't marry him and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both	0

agent:of course uh i've already been through this with them|agent:mine uh well mine are grown and uh|user:well do you have any uh children or are you in college	[noise] i see well	1
user:and usually then we talk a little bit about uh the size of the school and|agent:um-hum|user:and uh cost is always uh usually next on the list especially for the parents and uh financial assistance and scholarships	uh different types of organizations and activities that they can get involved in and of course distance from home and size of classes and	0
user:and a lot of times when it gets right down to the practical aspect of it they end up staying|agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum	pretty darn close to home because they can save money	0
user:and uh at this particular point you know taking appropriate course work but really|agent:good|user:but uh in terms of needs the older son is interested in the medical field	nothing uh that's in out of the ordinary	0
agent:okay_1|user:uh i'm a teacher|agent:right what do you do	and we're at a my husband and i are at a stage in life where	0

agent:i don't know in the pasture grazing and there's not much fixing with them either|agent:this well this is true you could just like have them_1 out there|user:[laughter] least you don't have to worry about maintaining them_1	[laughter]	1

user:well i guess that is the policy but it's been the policy for a long time and nothing ever happens|agent:so i think we should get one adopted permanently|agent:you go to read some old book or something and it's all confusing so i don't understand as much	uh	1
agent:because_1 someone says a kilogram no one knows what that is|agent:just get used to using all the terms|agent:more like what a meter is instead of how many feet in a meter or something	everyone wants a wants a conversion of that before put a recognizing it as a as	0

user:uh we have signs up on the NIST campus here|user:[noise] uh i mean there there are things you could do|agent:because_1 your your average guy driving down the highway [vocalized-noise] wants to know how many miles it is to his destination	speed limit twenty five miles per hour forty kilometers per hour	1

agent:and uh|user:[noise]|agent:you know for consumers to spend	yeah i'm not sure how i feel about	0
user:can be done or will be done are two different things|user:well|agent:in the long term	um	1
user:entitlement programs like education aid i think|user:ah a lot of|user:that ought to be slashed	ah	1
agent:oh i see what you['re]- i see what you're saying|user:teach you trades you know beauticians|user:which are so there not colleges but schools that	whatever at more and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition	1
user:they used to be at home all the time with the children and now most of them work out of the home|user:in the roles that they've played they've uh|user:well i feel that women have	because it takes two incomes to make it	0
agent:so she's going to so we don't have to do the|agent:um but even that she's planned on getting work which good for her is she works in a profession that she could get work at home|user:um-hum	oh well that's good that's really good	1
agent:uh she can do some work at home that that it makes it makes it a perfect fit but|agent:sure sure that on top of the fact that that uh|user:um-hum plus the clothing she has to have to wear	well that may be a thing for the future the computers now that they're they're trying to stress that for women to	0
agent:yeah but that's|user:they called them the bread winners and they'd support the whole family|agent:you know	but that's not the case now	0
user:too many problems|user:well unf[ortunately]- -[un]fortunately i don't expect a great deal out of them_1 they just have|agent:well i certainly am too now tell me what you expect from the Mavericks this year	too many ailments [laughter-too] [laughter-many] hurt bones and maybe too much age at this point	0
user:but i'm a i've always been a Boston Celtic fan too but|agent:well|user:they have a similar situation now that a lot of uh old guys on the team and but they're still playing good ball	you know i've lived in Texas since seventy four so being a	0
user:well you know|agent:versed on their capabilities but we really need to do something|agent:course i don't know any of the newer ones that they have and i'm not well of	i feel like uh the best they can hope for this year is probably ah an opportunity to make the play-offs i like their coach i really like Richie a lot	0
agent:uh it|user:oh i think you're right everything just been put out of perspective now you know you take a a young kid Roy Tarpley's age i'd say he was|agent:i mean we're gonna have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes i think	twenty one when he came into the league an[d]- and now he's probably an old age of uh twenty five or six	0

agent:well i i'm originally from Kansas and and uh south west Kansas which is extremely dry and it's the opposite but but i mean that real serene heat|agent:yeah|user:below of that eighty two or eighty three degrees at night and then over a hundred every day and that got to be awfully oppressive	yeah	1
agent:ran to the store and by the time i got back it had frozen out|user:yeah|agent:you know and so so i you know i tried to jump start it i couldn't get it in it still i mean had some it it was slushing and uh i tried to start it i couldn't the batteries dead and tried to jump start it i couldn't it didn't have a jumper cable	oh no	1
agent:well you actually get kind of get used to it after a while i mean and and and in the cold really it doesn't get at you that much because you you of course you learn how to dress well and the houses are well insulated and stuff|agent:[laughter]|user:shovel the driveway to get back in the morning and shovel it again the next morning they said it just got to be too much	yeah	1
agent:everything in there was copper and it was all soldered|user:[noise]|agent:well that's the thing that surprised me because once i got into the plumbing	right	1
agent:well i expected something to leak you know left a fitting loose or|user:[noise] that's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happen|agent:everything worked and i just said that's marvelous i appreciate it	right	1
user:and i wonder if maybe i should've used the gloss|agent:um-hum|user:it was a latex [plaint/paint] paint it was flat	uh but they say you uh use your gloss mainly in your	1
user:[noise] just didn't turn out|user:oh just kind of a worn look to it i don't eve[n]- even know how to say|user:it's kind of got uh	quite as nice as i would have liked but	1
user:but uh the dye lots uh must have been a little bit different from|agent:really|user:and uh [laughter] [laughter-that's] a an education in itself	first of all it takes quite a few rolls even a small room if you're trying to match a design and i	0
agent:um-hum|user:and cut around a window|agent:um-hum	but uh	1

agent:it is|user:uh have to address at some point or other and and uh it it's a tough decision to make especially|user:um that's uh that's something i think many people	depending on your the care that is needed and and uh	0
agent:uh graduate with a little you know with a name behind me rather than uh|agent:[laughter] [laughter-yeah] and and uh yeah my choice of graduate schools was uh you know it changed a whole lot i i got to where i i wanted to uh [noise]|user:[laughter-yeah] [laughter-wh[at]-] what you thought huh [noise]	just the degree itself	0
user:number one you nee[d]- you also need to to see what kind of name the like you mentioned before the name the college and university can|user:and so i i felt like|user:and around the surrounding states and so forth	can give you	1
agent:right|user:my two older brothers and i all went to thr[ee]- three different universities depending upon what our choice was so|user:and uh it was kind of unusual because my	[laughter]	0

agent:work with the Department of State Treasury in retirement disability uh calculate benefits|agent:i um|agent:and uh	i bet that's a interesting job	1
user:and|user:yeah it is|agent:it's a lot of money	yeah you have to stay up on stuff and i bet in your	0
agent:was about twenty five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent|agent:uh somebody was telling me the return|agent:some new space age materials plastics and all that so i think it's been a good investment	oh really	1
user:yeah i would li[ke]- i'd like to see that i'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and|agent:you talking about_1 uh uh a a fully manned space station that we'll keep up there|user:um	get up there an[d]- and see what's going on even if	0

agent:well it didn't it well it didn't hurt it though that's the bad thing|agent:yeah it is|user:that's pretty bad for a restaurant i guess probably doesn't help your business	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:but hopefully uh we'll have a nice hard winter and it'll kill them_1 all this year because_1 i don't wanna put up with that again|user:[noise] huh|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:oh i know it|user:yeah i guess you'd have to you don't want bugs in [laughter-there] that's for sure|user:wow	um	1
agent:yeah it's getting cool now i got a fire going so i'm enjoying it|user:i don't um probably nothing [laughter]|user:well	oh sounds good	0
user:well there're a number of them what happens is we have a number of school districts and|agent:and they are you know down in Salt Lake so for me that's not really an option are there very many private schools there in Dallas|agent:well there may be two private schools for the elementary age kids	those school districts	0
user:well|agent:um that that the teachers and and such make how are they down there do the teachers feel pretty good about them or are they|agent:oh huh does it what do you think about the salaries that our education	well you know salaries for teachers i think are low everywhere um	0
agent:uh-huh|user:um as far as i know they're doing something else but i don't know|agent:oh oh i'm i'm not sure i think that's the answer either [laughter] do do a lot of the teachers there that teach during the the winter months then have summer jobs	specifically	0
agent:hatchback nineteen eighty four|agent:well i have a Honda um|agent:[noise]	a[nd]-	1
user:uh and uh and very happy with it and i must admit it's you know if if if uh|agent:yeah|agent:um-hum	yeah my only consideration were were you know buying another car just to tool around town and and make you know brief trips and things like that i i would very very seriously consider buying one	0
user:yeah and|agent:ninety five is wild in any car there's no doubt about that because_1 i- i- i run over to Crystal City or used to i'm retiring the end of this month|agent:[noise]	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah beautiful beautiful machine|user:oh i know it's really amazing|agent:i get six hundred miles on a tank of gas	it's [laughter]	1
user:um|user:so um [noise] anyway and that's that's the other thing is that i've i've never really been too terribly much of a new car person i think i've bought one or two new cars in my life and i've tended to|agent:yeah	to uh buy cars that are	0
agent:wind directions because we get the uh Gary Indiana|user:um-hum|agent:our summers are extremely uh hazardous and during ah certain	um-hum	1

agent:so they've they've tried to do a lot of that and i|user:hm|agent:and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it's it is drivable	um-hum	1
user:yeah it it becomes it uh maybe to you and i who have grown up in some|user:yeah|user:um-hum	in s[ome]- uh	0
user:um you right|user:uh-huh|user:[noise] uh-huh	right	1
agent:you do it at home|agent:um-hum|agent:oh	uh-huh	0

user:and|agent:um-hum oh that sounds lovely|user:they're about oh i guess a third the size of your palm of your hand	of course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush	1
user:and uh we're|agent:uh-huh|user:we got a thousand pine trees from the you know soil and conservation people	in the process of of planting	1
user:moon flowers|agent:um-hum|user:the delicate flowers and the mums and we have morning glory and we have trumpet vine and	and we planted those out by the septic so that uh they get plenty of water	0
user:uh we've got some plum trees and some apple trees|user:well we got asparagus and|user:you know for the most part gardening for us is	some tomato	0
agent:uh uh what do you think about the Bush and the economy|agent:huh okay|user:um i'm more of a liberal or at least uh in between moderate more of a Democrat	um	1
user:for problems in that|user:yes that's been one of the areas for for|user:and if [noise]	we've had it more lightly in that respect but not without without uh without	1
agent:regulations controls|user:uh|agent:uh	an[d]-	1
user:um my sense is that|agent:ah|user:[noise] yes that's certainly true i'm not sure whether it's bad or not	that	0
user:is that uh Gorbachev is is is done for|user:uh well i guess the feeling as much as i hear by|agent:change of subject let's jump to Russia what's the feeling over there on the east coast about what's Russia doing and	unfortunate[ly]- oh unfortunately in a way at least everyone admires him uh but uh the future is with this this coalition	0
agent:you heard that one haven't you|agent:hey i wonder what happened to all that gold over there|user:it was to been bloodier than it's been through this point	the rumor is that much of it has been expended	1
agent:you know|agent:something like uh|agent:you know just	[noise]	1
agent:right you rape somebody i castrate you|user:because that's the hand you use i guess to to wipe your butt after you do your job|agent:right	right then after they catch you doing dealing if they catch that same person dealing in drugs again	0
user:you know he a hijacker gets put in jail and and Lord only knows what happens he doesn't get any kind of a death|agent:oh yeah|user:you know	penalty as far as punishment or capital punishment and we feed him and clothe him and give him a probably let probably put a TV	0
user:to be executed as far as i'm concerned if they get the hard facts on him and he is guilty|user:and for that guy to walk free if i mean he deserves|user:a rapist goes out	i mean you know this these people	0
agent:that's got a uh police block that's probably a mile long you know that led up to something like that that|agent:just at that point i mean the per[son]- whoever's done that you know killed someone has probably done|agent:it's just	yeah	0
agent:but here it's it's very stable and i [vocalized-noise] there's|user:right|agent:every few years like for an example would be the gov[ernments]- South American governments	yeah	1
agent:and uh i'm a um registered to vote in Pennsylvania|user:uh-huh|agent:yeah well that that's just it i'm i'm twenty four and i'm in the military	uh-huh	1
agent:higher priorities right [laughter]|user:yeah|agent:but it's just a question of taking the time and it's they're	right you know i think it's really interesting too like with this the latest election in Louisiana where there was the guy who had been part of the Ku Klux Klan	0
agent:racist racist practices and ra[ce]- race you know you ask those same people|agent:um harboring their own|agent:um flip side of that is the same people go around	uh-huh	1
user:not only our kids but every generation|user:is uh real important i think so it's real vital to the future of|user:[noise] uh well uh to begin i guess uh space	until the end of time i guess so	1
agent:yeah|user:oh have you|user:but uh	so what do you know about it	1
agent:[laughter]|user:[laughter-right]|agent:de[pending]- depending on what was left of my technology to get me home	right	0
user:you would never imagine would come|user:and they had stuff on the Jetsons from that cartoon that|agent:oh yeah yeah	become possible and now you we have lot of those so	1
agent:oh yeah|user:yeah but the economy the way it is all over them_1 they probably cut back on|agent:research will go on	on that because_1 it's not	1
agent:[laughter] one hopes [laughter]|user:he's supposed to be on our side isn't he|user:but that the guy that's taken over for Gorbachev he's supposed to be uh	or pretty much	1

agent:i don't remember i just i haven't seen it recently|agent:and uh hopefull[y]- do[n't]-|user:[noise] and i it seems like they excuse me but it seems like they used to advertise it on TV in the the Peace Corps	yeah	0
user:just uh|user:yeah that's that's certainly my was my experience|user:um-hum	[noise] it was like the the uh clock had been turned back about ten or fifteen years	0
agent:and of course they don't have usually normal families i mean [noise] there's not a a mother and a father and|user:uh-huh|agent:and uh i have had uh two little sisters and even though they were local to me it was almost being in a different world because both of my s[isters]- little sisters came from very poor backgrounds	yeah	1

user:a lot of the things that uh well we can't be able to afford|user:that sounds like a good idea i you know and that's that is right it is out of necessity because|user:well i'll have to [laughter-come] [laughter-and] [laughter-see] [laughter-them]	but also i i s[ometimes]- sometimes think that uh	0
agent:uh [vocalized-noise] with uh with the router you can make nice uh [noise] i guess dado joints is what it's called|agent:that's worked pretty well|agent:and uh	right or yes i yeah i'm	0
agent:you're probably better off with a a table saw|user:yes|user:yes	well and with a radial arm saw if you do have a a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you wouldn't be able to do that	0
user:i w[ould]- you know i've used in school and uh|user:yeah lot of the equipment too that i've i've used in the past uh|agent:yeah [vocalized-noise]	i would i don't know i'd i'd kind of like to to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say a table saw	0
agent:[noise]	[noise] think the Cowboys are gonna	0
user:yeah they'll probably want to see Emmett Smith and uh|agent:yes i think so because uh i think Warren Moon and uh Steve Beuerlein and Troy Aikman are some of the hottest quarterbacks for the uh for the nineteen nineties|user:yeah i don't think there'd be any problem there the only question is would the rest of the country be interested in watching two Texas teams slug it out	and uh see Novacek and see Irwin out there and	0
agent:physical abuse that the NFL offers he might not make it|agent:Troy Aikman i wonder even though he's a real good player i wonder if he's going to be able to uh stand the|agent:um	well his problem is that he since he doesn't seem as mobile	0
agent:that are are more consistent i think Beuerlein has been more consistent|agent:um i like that these other quarterbacks that|agent:he's not consistent he he has a good day he has a bad day	well Beuerlein's only had interceptions in one of the six games he's played and	0
user:he had an amazing day he rallied|user:threw for four touchdown passes and ran for one and|user:he um	the team down from seventeen points	0
user:but|agent:[laughter-yeah] that was a low scoring game|user:blowouts or like the Cotton Bowl a disaster	well it was it was a disaster	1

agent:the extra long option with all the power options you know windows locks and the nice stereo|user:um-hum|agent:because_1 because when you you know you can like pick Dodge for instance they got two sizes of mini vans one's the extra long and then the other	uh-huh	1
agent:it's just sickening i was on the University of Texas campus when that|user:but|agent:yeah uh	i	1
user:we have guns in our home but my husband|user:if they're out after a gun they need a cooling off period|user:people need	uh used to hunt all my sons hunt	1

agent:i'll be there's a law in Texas says you can't have them in bar i think it would be a lot more sense if they say please check them at the front door because i know people are in there with them on|user:uh-huh uh-huh|agent:get too drunk	oh really	1
user:[noise] but i kind of i liked it in some ways and some ways i didn't|agent:oh uh-huh|user:[noise] oh it was a preschool day care type of thing	um i think the	1
user:oh you know one thing i noticed is uh|agent:sh[e]- she went|user:that she didn't	um just they were trying to get her to teach her to write her name	1
user:tried to say look you're holding your|user:or uh|user:noticed that and either pointed it out to me or	she's holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff sh[e]- but she was	1
agent:huh|user:no|agent:well they'd never picked it out though	they never	1
agent:-[ta]ken care of|user:oh yeah|agent:to a day care where they're	i think it would be hard to take them to people you don't know	1
user:you don't even really have any|user:the older ones it's not|user:it is	real worries because_1 you know that they'll play with	0
user:and do it really|user:work full time and|user:that have young kids work and	without being stressed out all the time i think it's	1
user:no|agent:yeah well um the work never ends [vocalized-noise] for sure [vocalized-noise] uh|user:gosh what i[s]- is this important what i'm doing [laughter-and]	no it [noise] it doesn't	1
user:even when we go out for a few hours that|user:i feel such a responsibility|user:i think i just think it would be hard to do that full time	are they driving the babysitter crazy and	1
user:well that's what we have had here in Dallas for|user:um|agent:the with the neighborhood we have around here it was automatic gunfire going off instead of fire works	oh for the past year we lost so many people due to crime this past year	0
agent:yeah|user:you mean in their clothing they|agent:i mean people get bothered at the grocery stores and everything its getting pretty bad	okay	0
user:was riding in the car with his mother and father on New Year's Eve night|user:we had a little boy in wes[t]- uh well it's west of here|user:we have	and someone fired into the car there were three children in the backseat	0
agent:and it's not fair|user:yes|agent:it's not even the people that are doing it that are paying for it it's the innocent ones that are dying from it	no way can we um [noise] anyway i pray that you have a good New Year	1
agent:oh [laughter-really]|user:i still have an apartment that has furniture up on bricks because of the rain um-hum and i live in a a nice part of Dallas but um|user:oh	anyway if th[e]- if the criminals a[nd]- do not come around here i'm going to be extremely fortunate	0
user:uh|user:okay real real fine|agent:work off of there	first of all uh yes uh i do own a PC here at home and i also have one at uh the office	0
user:lot of uh analytical|user:and i also enjoy using ours at home and we u[sed]- used it for a a number of different things plus i get in a lot an awful lot of good use of the one at work where i work|user:the same PC i got two years ago at the fraction of the cost	um	0
agent:and so we got one that that could do enough uh and you know hold three different OS's|user:uh-huh|agent:the absolute top of the line because spouse is a uh programmer	[laughter]	1
agent:and uh|user:great|agent:technical publishing and we do a a quite a bit of church work with ours	we do an awful lot of that [laughter-too] [laughter-with] [laughter-ours]	1
agent:uh mainly because of spouse's Unix because_1 Unix|user:yes|agent:huh like i said we bought a real steam steam burner	yes has to su[pport]- you have to have that to support Unix	1
agent:universal health insurance right|user:[noise] okay|agent:[noise] okay	um that's right	1

agent:i'm in Richardson|user:um well where in Dallas are you|user:okay	oh okay so you do re[cycling]- do recycling there	0
user:you know one place where you could do everything|user:but um and it's kind of disappointing i mean i would even be happy if they just had one|agent:oh	you know it would still be more convenient than what we have now	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:um-hum|user:and all that sort of thing but um i think that you know i heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is and so hopefully they'll do it soon that would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week	where i grew up we only had one a week and that was certainly sufficient so if they just do one of them will be trash and the alternate time would do recyclables that'd be great	1
user:um-hum|agent:um or you're not supposed to put magazines in there and you can't take newspapers now at work uh you know we have changed our recycling at first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle and not too long ago they finally decided if it's anything that's paper and tears you can throw it in there because_1 at first they said|user:oh okay	[laughter] let me guess you work at TI right	0
user:uh-huh|agent:well we had th[e]- the one person who used to take things to the Dallas Shelter i think that's what that was called|user:and it worked out really well	uh-huh	1
user:from what i've seen on the news [noise] there's a a a|agent:um-hum|user:drug testing procedures would have to be refined	pretty good size problem with	0
user:yeah|agent:a positive indication of drugs but there's not really there weren't really any there uh every now and then there's an error and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated [noise]|agent:positive negatives or some some kind of word they use when a uh you get a uh	oh yeah	1
agent:[noise] uh-huh|user:as each employee comes in|agent:um-hum	part of the hiring procedure is a	0
agent:okay yeah then he's been working for the company for a while too yeah he enjoys it good company um you all uh|user:yeah Sam's is part of Wal-Mart|user:[noise] yeah	yeah	1
agent:how long were we su[pposed]- i haven't done this in a couple months how long were we supposed to discuss for|agent:well uh|agent:yeah that's what my brother was telling me that's good good new[s]- good deal	uh you're supposed to get five minutes	1

agent:um|user:it was too much hassle you have to spray it|user:well we did have strawberries a few years ago but we don't do them_1 anymore and we had a peach tree and	and uh	0
agent:how about_1 you|agent:uh that should be governed by by the government uh per se i think it should be b[y]- more by the private institution|user:um-hum	yeah i think they the corporations should uh do all that they should uh	0
agent:the public and he has a and has a gun in his holster or or even you know if it's a guy at McDonald's cooking a burger i think [noise] they're dangerous in either situation|agent:uh yeah you know whether [noise] whether in in the case that you brought up you know whether [vocalized-noise] uh you know whe[ther]- if it's a policeman and he's working with uh|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:oh yeah|user:like they've been laying off a lot of people and uh|agent:uh-huh	and uh	1
agent:sure sure yeah i would agree with you i i can't see i can't see how we can expect the you know uh uh|user:and that cost u[s]- the country you know billions of dollars|agent:oh yeah	so	1
agent:yet [laughter] generally if we're gonna get them it's not going to happen uh prior to January one you know you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting in December but|agent:that's what i was thinking|user:so here i know that um last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state and i'm glad to see there haven't been any this year	yeah [laughter-yet] still could come [laughter-huh]	1
user:uh-huh|agent:uh a bunch o[f]- boys at one time and so its better for us if it hasn't been just totally wet before we [laughter-go]|user:yeah	yeah so you do that even in January huh	0
user:yeah|agent:dry but pretty even climate wasn't it year round fairly not wide fluctuations|agent:central okay so that was	yeah	1

agent:so we don't watch CNN [laughter]|user:oh|agent:no we don't	oh [laughter] well we couldn't get TV here if we didn't have cable we live close to the mountain	1
agent:now that'll be nice|user:uh it wouldn't i don't know|user:but we've thought of getting a satellite so that we could get more stations but	yeah but i don't think we're gonna to do it	0
agent:uh-huh|user:ours is eight dollars a month|agent:i would think	so how would that figure up with what you'd do	1

agent:you know at odd hours that i get|agent:[noise] but particularly what i was speaking of are the telemarketing phone calls|user:so do you	buy computers	1
agent:well i've i i've studied advertising in college and|user:yep you seem well informed|agent:yeah well i- i- i- i suppose that's true but i know that you know whenever you're giving that kind of information out particularly when you're buying something you know your name automatically goes on a list which is sold sold to a hundred other companies	[noise]	1
agent:you know uh everybody's self esteem you know gee somebody thinks i'm pretty you know|agent:and i found i found her tactics extremely rude because she was preying on my uh|agent:and i mean i was shopping for Christmas presents in the mall [laughter]	sure	1
user:it was interesting|agent:oh what a bummer|user:i had to show my ID and uh blood type and because_1 i didn't have a sales slip and	yeah uh	1
agent:oh you do|user:oh i've decided there's so many places in Dallas i will not make too many repeats and i thoroughly enjoy the ethnic foods|agent:so that's what me we mostly do what do you prefer when you go out	yes certainly	0
agent:but uh have you been to any place lately that you enjoyed|agent:and um we recently went to an Ethiopian restaurant and uh sampled that kind of food rather different|agent:a nice Chinese once in a while is is very tasty	yes i found a little place over in uh Preston Center tonight it's uh	0
agent:um-hum|user:so appeal[ing]- [noise]|agent:um-hum	oh wait i have a c[all]- just a second	0

agent:and uh our street is uh the nicest homes are on our street i will say that not uh being boastful but i think our street does have the nicer homes|user:oh|agent:you know our subdivision is really only about seventy homes	uh-huh	1
agent:i know a little bit|agent:i really don't know much about home construction i well|user:oh	uh-huh	1
user:yeah and i think that's that's basically my standpoint too is my dad and i've talked about this a lot and i just|agent:it was killing him [laughter]|agent:tax bracket and that was just you know	personally i think it's kind of i don't know we pay a lot	1
agent:get by without continually raising taxes|agent:and i think that we could|user:yeah	absolutely	1
agent:you know necessary protections for the worker|agent:you know a[nd]- a[nd]- and and it's because of in part|user:yeah	right	1
agent:maybe market orientation a little bit more and and things like what you're talking about um|agent:you know|user:right	um-hum	1
agent:entirely corrupt they have uh you know|user:[laughter]|agent:yeah i i think m[y]- my wife's from Brazil and i've spent a fair amount of time there and and you wanna see a government system that just doesn't work you know i mean it's just its incredible its just	uh-huh	1
agent:it is it air-conditioned|user:is typical for the neighborhood|user:so uh but ours is	but	1
user:and so our house was small to start with but uh we added three baseme[nt]- three bedrooms in the basement and|user:oh we had uh we have had six children|user:uh-huh	like i say added on to it so	0
agent:in the study where i have a computer so we wanted a separate study and we have that|agent:i uh spend quite a little time in uh both when i was working and also even now retired|agent:so we have an entry way and	um-hum	1

user:we just started it this year|agent:they're trying it out and deciding wh[at]- what they're gonna do with it|user:um-hum	and it's really nice to be able to have that convenience as opposed to having to go to a local	0
user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:be successful and that they will decide to go ahead and and spread it to our neighborhood as well|agent:i think so too i i am uh in hopes that that will	the one thing that they don't re[cycle]- uh pick up they actually don't care if we mix together the aluminum and the bottles we put those all in one big bag and then put the paper goods separately but the one thing they don't pick up are the plastic goods you know um	0
user:[laughter]|agent:but that is it used to be such a pain and it's so far away from us and that's the only one she knew of|user:um-hum	you have to be motivated to do that when you're that far away after a point [noise]	1
agent:so it's um|user:um-hum|user:um	that's great	1

user:having a very tough time in a recessionary period|user:and now we're|user:we had uh America uh was a one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned	we're also have a very humongous trade deficit	0
agent:is that the [noise] they seem to be social they seem to be economically driven also|user:um-hum|agent:[noise] i think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes	um-hum	1
user:that someth[ing]- yeah because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position they they're very comfortable they lose the ability to learn|agent:oh yeah|user:you think that's great	and the in a sense become unteachable they think they know all there is to know in their area set path and	0
agent:yeah|user:so i i believe that uh an individual should really learn how to to learn|user:yes i agree with that i agree with that	learn how to adapt learn how to grow in the	0
agent:[noise]|user:i see big opportunities in|agent:and i'm sure that we haven't quite decided where we stand in that yet	Europe opening up	0
user:basically remember getting some sort of [trax/tax] tax credit years ago and i think it helped i think we bought a car|agent:um-hum|user:uh give them_1 some tax credits i think they've done that i seems like i remember that happening once in my past i'm in my forties and i	uh at that time because we got some sort of a rebate	1
user:and sometimes i go with them and sometimes i don't uh since i no longer work|agent:um-hum|user:every year it seems like she's got a new suggestion	uh usually it's not very complicated anymore but uh	1
agent:yes that|user:and things like that i can no longer afford [noise] things that maybe i used to take for granted|user:so it took some while to adjust to it and it and it took some adjusting financially	and i certainly can't invest money like i used to [laughter]	1
agent:well mostly fiction and um i- i the nonfiction i like are are the usually the crime stories|user:uh me too what kind of books do you read|agent:but books i could talk about you know forever i [laughter]	i see	1
user:this|user:no it's about um|agent:now now what is that about is that uh an espionage thing	multimillionaire that has decided that he wants to start	0
agent:yes now uh both of them were terrific|user:yes i did|agent:oh ye[s]- y[ou]- did you read his other one The Red Dragon	they were uh Silence of the Lambs though was	0
agent:about the uh bombing in the in the Superdome oh it was oh and they made a movie out of that|agent:and the other the previous ones were murder um the he wrote also Black Sunday which was a|agent:uh probably another murder thing you know that's usually what he you know well thi[s]- this'll be i think his fourth or fifth book	oh	1
agent:oh|user:yeah i have one little daughter she's just a year and a half|agent:yeah do you have children	and i think about all we ever do is just pick up after her it seems like [laughter]	0
agent:yeah i- i think one of the very most important [vocalized-noise] [vocalized-noise] was i- i guess about the most important thing that you can do for small children like that is to read to them|user:the attention's not that interesting to her for very long|user:or else she loses her loses a a[ttention]-	um-hum	1
user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:uh i uh i made great strides and i i'm sure you'll experience the same thing|user:uh-huh and it	yeah i- i uh my mom used to spend quite a bit of time and	1
agent:yeah|user:then they're proud if their kids are in bed by eight you know which means they only get to spend about two hours a day with them and i just kind of wonder|agent:um-hum	you know there's	0

user:yeah|user:yeah|agent:they probably would be married and having their children [laughter] so [laughter] i guess it's a combination	yeah seems like there uh-huh go ahead	1
agent:and the house and everything are concerned not from what i see and and they're contributing to the income besides|agent:very much less i don't think as far as the kids and|agent:they're not doing	yeah	1
agent:and i really hate that you know i hate to see that an[d]- and i've been here for a very long time|user:um-hum|agent:i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better	um-hum	1

agent:it's hard to say|user:um-hum|agent:they might wanna do without things rather than do that to their families	yeah it is i think some i don't know how many you know what percentage but some are will move back toward	0
user:and it makes me wonder i'm not saying that i'm uh i'm certainly not|user:um uh|agent:yeah	a hawk necessarily	0
user:i don't know what we've we've seen so many changes just in the past|agent:and|user:[noise] well	five years uh it makes me think it reminds me of that book uh Future Shock	0
user:the the st[ories]- the stories and the and the sights of these these|user:number one you've got uh you know you see on the news|user:that it can be ah stable	the Soviet people these Russian people that are standing in line uh for hours on end and have for you know bare shelves	0
user:yeah and i don['t]- i don't that's just it [noise] it's fu[nny]- it's inconceiva[ble]- inconceivable to me|agent:-[i]t's hard to imagine managing such a rapid change|agent:uh i don't know it it's it's	to think that anyone or any entity i don't care	0
user:and um i was a teacher for seven years|agent:oh|user:that's funny because i just um quit my job to stay home with my kids	in the public schools so i	0
agent:uh-huh|user:uh was like bilingual education|user:i'm not sure it's being taken care of right now	for um different um	0
user:regular classrooms the remaining of the part of the day|user:and then for just a small amount of time and then they're into their|user:or a bilingual program	and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they don't read or speak	0
agent:you know that that time you know typically the mother was at home with uh|agent:it's even harder when both parents are required to work and can't spend|agent:i've seen the same thing and heard the same things and at the same time i've heard that	yeah	1
agent:education is given to them so|agent:remedial uh|agent:to their fullest potential and they're gonna fail unless some sort of	right	0
user:i wish that all the children could be exposed to that program|agent:yep|user:reading program and it is just excellent it is	you know and then there i know that there are some parents that say how do i get my kids in that and yet they don't qualify but	0

agent:wow|user:and it basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it|user:no a five speed	[noise] so i guess in this area at least you know if it's not automatic it doesn't move	1
agent:i don't know it it's really more fun than anything else as long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic it's fun [laughter]|agent:i[t]- it does uh|agent:i[t]-	um-hum	1
agent:the little experiments that they've done and so forth you know|user:yeah|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1

agent:is that no i don't even know about that|user:there could be some val[uable]- i guess there's a shuttle going up tomorrow as far as i|agent:right right	yeah i think it's	0
agent:they have been weightless so long and then they course they exercise but it's not the same as exercising with gravity|agent:m[uscle]- tone and so forth because_1 they uh|user:oh really	oh really i hadn't heard that	1

agent:so it wasn't like they were necessarily from all over the country but|user:uh-huh uh-huh [noise]|agent:in Missouri but this is was in Indiana [noise] and it was a lot of the people had kind of stayed in one area	now given the size of the group were there people were most of the families fairly large is that what contributed to that [noise]	1
user:and i know that my grandparents' families were fairly large but my father has just one brother and my mom has one brother|user:i would expect yeah yeah|agent:sometimes when you've moved perhaps your family reunion if there ever one would would be back in Michigan i mean that would be where your roots would be	so we've kept in touch those first cousins very pretty closely um	0
agent:i don't know that's the American way|agent:but|agent:interesting sometimes a little sad when families branch out quite so much	did you find that you had a lot in common did people find out things about each other that they hadn't been aware	1
agent:well we got the bloodhound and the rabbits and the bloodhound didn't mix well so [laughter] they were easier to get rid of than the big dog and my kids were anxious to have a have a puppy|user:i bet what happened to the rabbit|user:[laughter]	um-hum	1
user:and they kind of you know look at each other and everything and then|agent:[laughter]|user:and she kisses Nikki	then Ch[asta]- uh Lady'll turn around and come back down stairs	0
agent:it's just really gotten out of hand i mean he has called and threatened my kids and to come over and [laughter-kill] the dog|user:um-hum|agent:and every time they come over of course he's very well behaved and he doesn't bark or anything and so	oh	1
user:um-hum um-hum|user:um-hum|agent:he is an alcoholic so i think he's just found something to vent his anger on and it's he's decided that it's us but	well we don't have that problem Lady hardly ever barks at all unless she's outside playing	0
agent:well see everybody everybody all the way up has a dog that's what's so strange [laughter] every house a[ll]- you know all the way up fr[om]- on five you know five houses up from me and five houses down have dogs|user:and uh well of course two of two other neighbors have dogs you know|agent:yeah	and they get to come over and play	1

agent:uh-huh|user:which in a way i think it it could be a little bad but|agent:oh okay	so far it's working out okay	1
agent:but that's one thing they could use as a retirement plan unless you do unless you are committed to using your 401K as a as a retirement program|agent:but uh they made a nice presentation so the company decided to go with them|user:uh-huh	right	1

user:our given rights our our given uh gifts are rather th[at]- that are different from men and and it's okay that|agent:like|user:i think that over time we will recognize what	that there are some differences	0
agent:very costly uh and uh as a society we are paying a staggering price for this|agent:physical mental and spiritual health uh it's really|agent:our uh	yes	1
user:that's the one thing we have no control over are these charges that happen when you go to hospitals|user:and that's what's giving the local um insurance companies hard times|user:yes	and you get something done and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it	1

agent:yeah it ended up working all right|user:so it worked it did end up working out pretty well|agent:turn out the way it should have so	the one thing i sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is	0
agent:to really know what's going on|agent:uh i don't think that they they they educate them_1 enough to|user:um you know issue is under discussion	in in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a a bank matter of some kind so	1
agent:yeah we do have the death penalty here it's not exercised very often [noise] but we do have it|user:uh Greg uh i'm i'm not familiar i think uh you guys in Indiana don't you have the the death penalty|user:[noise]	uh-huh	1
agent:right|user:person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder [noise] i think that [noise] maybe a|agent:right	a good solution to capital punishment might be uh reserve it solely for uh repeat offenders of a crime like uh murder	1
agent:i ju[st]- basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that i just|agent:yeah you're you're right there uh|user:uh jail sentence for them is just another chance to uh create another power structure [laughter] you know the	uh-huh	1
agent:don't know on that question it just seems like for instance the Jeffrey Dahlmer case i mean i- i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets and in that case Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment|agent:i really|agent:well i-	um-hum	1
agent:y[eah]- yeah that is very curious|user:[noise] [noise] so uh that was a curious case i|user:yeah	uh uh that was something is sort of nightmarish	0
agent:and i finally was [noise] so it was an interesting experience i was kind of boring|user:uh-huh|agent:been voting for years and i couldn't figure out why i hadn't been called yet	was it civil or criminal	1
user:that|agent:mix for their case so they ask all kinds of wild questions|agent:whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like you know they want to get the best uh	that's a science in itself	1
agent:so uh the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again cost him a lot of money i'm sure|user:uh-huh|user:right	yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous it's s[imple]- a simple majority you know rules|user:getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case	yeah	1
agent:yeah [laughter] if not [laughter] we're up a creek|user:uh-huh so you pretty much keep pretty close to your budget|agent:what we're allotted	yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:we've [vocalized-noise] gone to the house but sometimes you dip into it|agent:and that was tough to get we try to not touch that	exactly and see we've got two used cars and you know when you have used cars there's always something you're fixing on them	0
agent:oh wow|user:yeah and they're moving their offices u[p]- offices up to Connecticut|agent:liquor distiller	so i'll be staying down here [noise] but i'm not real worried about it so but it's something else that you know we have to be considering in our budget	0
user:[noise]|user:yeah well i wanna try to um|agent:looking for part-time work just to try off to pay off her car	go back to school	0
agent:all right well thanks for talking Wendy|agent:oh good|agent:oh okay	yeah it was nice talking to you	1
agent:by commercial standards isn't it usually about sixty to a hundred a week|agent:uh-huh that seems relatively low|user:they charge about forty five dollars a week	um yeah it's it's pretty pretty expensive on the outside	1
agent:because a lot of kids are in you know in centers we[ll]- well not really centers but they're being cared for by neighbors and uh|agent:and uh that was i- i thought it was import[ant]- well i mean it is important uh that that people have the opportunity to select the service that they would choose|user:yeah	um-hum	1
user:uh|agent:s[o]- s[o]- so what do you think about the about the child about the tax credit versus the subsidy approach which s[eems]- seems most appealing to you|user:you know it it worked out pretty good	well i haven't really thought about it like that [laughter]	0
agent:oh really|user:uh yeah i had a a good friend who just did it and and my boss too [laughter]|user:um-hum um-hum	yeah and uh and	0
user:but at that point|user:the nurses now i don't know that it would have been any better in a nursing home|user:and she was able to stay in her apartment but the but the cost of that was unbelievable to have	it was	0
user:mean obviously uh|user:you know that's really hard and i don't know what you know what the different things that you would look for i|user:right exactly and if the and and yet if the care is just is just so hard then that's	you want it to be cl[ean]- you know	1
user:exactly|agent:and has been independent all their lives and then all of a sudden you know|user:it doesn't feel i would think that would be easier than someone who really does know and is saying i d[on't]-	and i you know i do[n't]- i don't want to go kind of thing but the other side of it is that my grandmother	0
user:but but it's just that|user:yeah|user:um-hum	you know how do you i guess unless you visit a lot and unexpectedly and assuming that you can visit unexpectedly	1
agent:also paper and plastic bags|agent:i recycle glass plastic and aluminum|user:um-hum what materials do you recycle	um-hum	1
user:well i think|agent:was going to just put it in the landfill i mean i could have done that|agent:i would really be disturbed if i found out that the place i took it to	um that is kind of becoming one of the drivers now the fact that	0
user:uh|agent:i mean like the the green and white barred|user:and	oh we don't use that kind of paper any more	0
agent:and those baby food jars believe it or not really add up fast|user:um-hum|agent:quite a few of the children are in baby food	[noise] right	0
agent:i'm pretty diverse actually um i consider myself both a performer and also an enjoyer so i kind of get into all all types i run the gamut from uh|user:[noise] well what kind of music do you like to listen to|agent:[noise]	are you	1
agent:DMZ|agent:groups like uh i'm trying to remember|agent:yeah i had a i had a roommate that was really into that he was into all the um	um-hum	1
agent:it it's good for a side diversion and a little bit of side income you know whenever i can do you do you play anything at all|agent:and played trumpet for about ten so|user:oh wow	yeah	1
agent:it'll probably be a while before i uh before i get into the kids' music in at all so|user:yeah well yeah|agent:i'm not quite at that point in my life [laughter-yet] so	[noise]	1
user:i guess sounds like a cliche but|user:paying too much if i'm sure that i'm getting value for the dollar i mean that|user:middle income tax payer i'm not	uh looking around at a a lot of the infrastructure particularly in the northeast here	0
user:um i kind of came of age in the|user:seems to be concerned with just that you know who's who's gonna start getting more and how fast|user:in terms of of tax reform or or revenue reallocation	sixties and it seemed to me seems to me that the the general attitude in the	0
user:the typical|user:yeah i i've never been able to reconcile that fact which which does seem to be true with the fact that|agent:and we weren't a debtor nation in those days	middle class family	1
agent:sounded pretty good at the time when you when you had a fair amount of disposable income and uh|agent:mentality uh|agent:uh	um-hum	1
user:yeah|agent:and it seemed like that uh plastic would would would've been very helpful to recycle well finally they started plastics but only the kind of milk bottle plastics|user:um-hum	um-hum oh that	1
agent:um-hum|user:yeah yeah that seems like it would be you know very labor intensive to actually you know go through it all and|agent:yeah that would that would be good because_1 uh you know	pick out the different things	1
agent:um-hum|user:the systems basically has this very large backlog of of material to be recycled and|user:[noise] their you know the the the the	and processed and	0
user:um-hum|agent:and i think some of the plastics are are are are among those that's rather difficult to re[cycle]- it's just to recycle them there needs to be a greater economies of scale before they become uh viable|user:um	yeah yeah i think it depends on like the little number in the circle	0
user:uh-huh|agent:nah not really my parents are still pretty young my father's forty five mother about the same age|user:nursing homes and the elderly that sort of thing in your own life	oh that's very young	1
agent:kind of thing where they cancel you a couple of years after you get in into the home|agent:well i've heard about most of that insurance i was wondering because it seems like what i've heard is usually that the stuff says uh|agent:yeah	[noise]	1
agent:and certainly more dignified than uh|user:yeah|agent:yeah	yeah its	0
user:huh um|agent:yeah it seems that way|agent:yeah	do you do you have grandparents who are left	1
agent:yeah|user:well it's always a tough question you know i mean with not only|agent:yeah i mean it seems like they'd be almost just you know better off just withholding care to some some degree	the elderly but sick people in general	0
agent:yeah|agent:right|user:really knows isn't going to make a real difference but they're sort of left not knowing what else to do	than everything they can do	1
agent:you know like death row and stuff just leaving them_1 there and sit there and make taxpayer pay for it i think they ought to do something about it|agent:instead of giving the people o[n]- on uh|agent:you know they need to	yeah i think it does does get uh strung out too long that they uh	0
user:yeah|agent:just yeah couple days ago|agent:yeah we had uh one	well they haven't executed anybody in uh in our state of New Hampshire	0
agent:dealers out on the street you know and i think they they need to get c[apital]- the capital punishment|agent:uh|agent:partly you know they're a lot responsible for it because_1 they're the ones selling the drugs to the to the	i think capital punishment in those instances is probably even more effective than for uh the just the common street criminal that kills somebody	1
agent:oh yeah|user:but a drug dealer a major drug dealer is effecting what thousands of lives|user:but	and in effect causing some of them_1 to die	1
agent:okay you too|user:okay well it's been nice talking with you hope you have a nice day|agent:uh yeah [laughter]	good evening talk to you later bye-bye	0
agent:yeah yeah they they they they'll check for alcohol|user:they do it with alcohol|agent:pardon	oh i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine	1
user:well they have safety features with each of the|user:you know wor[king]- they're working with explosives and so they could blow up the whole|user:yeah so that's you know i'm all for it because the well the type of environment i work in	explosives they use but still	0
user:[laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-have] [laughter-the]|agent:yeah really it's one of those things that you read once and then if you if you're not worried about it you just forget [laughter-about] [laughter-it] [laughter]|user:i think our policy is that all right it's probably the same thing i'm not really sure becau[se]- [laughter-anyway]	[laughter-that's] [laughter-right]	0
user:huh|agent:you know equipment machinery and stuff|agent:yeah [vocalized-noise] especially around uh	that's true	1
agent:well i think i think wh[at]- y[ou]- i think the problem here is is that a a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs|user:to reject somebody just knowing that they have take drugs i mean suppose they found out some other way|user:yeah uh i guess i basically agree that uh do you think it's okay for a company	yeah s[o]-	1
agent:The other side of it is is besides its being an invasion of of personal privacy as in my it's my bodily fluid and i don't really want you to look at it or or|agent:you know i really|agent:which uh	[vocalized-noise] uh-huh	1
agent:anything like that just kind of scares me|user:[noise]|user:hum	i tend to to view it	0
agent:a different state besides Texas [laughter]|agent:oh so another one from|user:okay and i'm Melanie from Harrisville Utah	yeah [laughter] um okay Bill we're talking about family reunions	0
agent:usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday and|user:oh let's see what else|user:um	uh-huh	1
agent:because she's such a great cook|user:oh|agent:gone first	oh now how old is she	1
agent:uh also one thing that's helpful and i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever but most of all my family lives like in the same county [laughter] so it's just kind of like get on the telephone and|user:i wasn't sure i appreciated that duty [laughter-for] two years in a [laughter-row] [laughter] but i found that advance planning was the key to success|user:so that was a real challenge and i was president of our family reunion for two years and	uh-huh	1
user:to uh|user:have a brother lives in Australia|user:well Australia i	Boise Idaho and	0
user:[laughter] they must really like it there [laughter]|agent:nobody moves away except us [laughter] yeah i got out as soon as i graduated [laughter]|user:oh my gosh	yeah [laughter] oh	1
agent:most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree|agent:and uh the only reason i didn't uh get into that more when i was had my little business was because uh|agent:uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks	uh-huh	0
agent:[noise]	[noise] so um	0
user:i do i have uh one son|agent:do you have children|user:yeah	who will be three in May	0
user:to give my wife a little more time with the|user:just to give him a little more time with other kids and|user:uh	the baby	1
agent:well with our oldest one they didn't have kindergarten in Texas|agent:well we generally with most of our kids there were|user:yeah i mean they'll get it eventually anyhow uh h[ow]- how old are your kids when they started some sort of school	um-hum	1
user:maybe just with a few other mothers|agent:yeah|user:starting up a little preschool	and it would be sort of a mom it would end up being a mom's day off thing because_1 they would take turns	0
agent:very good|user:what kind of what's their relationship like|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:my son is a|user:wait a minute this should be very simple|user:hold it no that child is	that child is your son's nephew	0
agent:four hours from here they're in San Antonio|agent:they live about uh|user:oh yeah i would think that would have a lot of rewards does your does your daughter live nearby	oh well	1
user:it really gives me peace of mind to know that my wife is home|user:but it is nice to i mean i- i find it|user:um	with our son you know as as far as knowing what kind of care he's getting	1
user:and uh ride the bike and do the what's called the stair master|user:i go to a gym and|user:just probably in the last four or five months i've been able to pick up um	so that's uh i try to do that three or four times a week	0
user:uh i did biking i like to swim a lot too|user:so but before that i did|user:uh last five six months	so	0
user:if i wasn't doing it properly or what but|user:and i don't i don't know|user:i just didn't feel like it was doing much for me	i didn't	0
user:ah|agent:this job just involves sitting in in front of a keyboard all day long writing computer programs|agent:uh	yeah well i- i run after preschoolers [laughter] at this point so	1
user:right now i'm|user:um|user:but now it's you know i don't like to wake up but once i'm up i enjoy it an[d]- i an[d]- and i enjoy the the challenge of seeing how much further i can get and	you know increasing levels on the bike or increasing time on the the stair master	0
user:and you can set it up where|user:biked and how many calories it's burned|user:uh levels that you can um ride on or walk on and it tells you you know how far you've walked or how far you've um	um you can be going up hills or you can just be going just constant level and	1
user:since then i've been hearing uh|agent:yeah [noise]|user:[noise] good way for companies to weed out people with drug problems but	well i read an article in the Wall Street Journal last year that talked about um the different results that they get from	0
agent:uh-huh|user:plane or something of course there'd be increased need for it|user:employee turnover health problems and accidents and theft and i understand that certain jobs like if you're driving a train or	one thing that always kind of bugged me about it was uh	1
agent:i don't know we just seem to have a rash of drunk driving and killings around here lately and uh|agent:harm with the uh|agent:it can do more	[noise]	0
agent:they use cocaine|agent:i know i have some friends whose children of uh you know it's|agent:[laughter] yeah and i i'm afraid you know it may become that with some of these other drugs too that uh	uh-huh	1
agent:i camp uh every month uh camp at least one weekend and during the summer we camp uh two or three weeks a year [laughter]|user:ah ha|agent:uh yes i'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts	oh well that that sounds good	1
user:um we have five children and so|user:oh i would say quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and i|agent:[laughter] how about_1 yourself	we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves so	0
user:um|agent:uh do they cook on stoves|agent:what uh what kind of camping do they like best do they like it where they have tents and	yes they've well	1
agent:we just use trail tarps|user:oh is that right|agent:so lots of times we don't even take tents	oh and what does that consist of	0
user:um|agent:um-hum|user:i like to sleep on the mattresses	so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild animals or anything like that	1
agent:um-hum|user:they're covered with like a heavy armor|user:oh uh	type stuff uh-huh	1
agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	okay should begin	1
agent:uh [vocalized-noise]|user:um-hum|agent:you know overall i'm satisfied with it we don't have the vision care we do have the health care and the uh and the medi[cal]- or the dental	are you a professor there	1
user:so it's really unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever um|agent:uh-huh|user:but here you don't get that you maybe get two or three a year	you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time so	0
user:it's kind of an interesting plan it's kind of cold though they've essentially made up a list of uh|user:toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing|agent:right	oh all the different uh	0
user:but i'm not sure that's that's widely followed any more|agent:um-hum|user:historically a lot of companies i think carried dental as a rider along with the medical	i'm not sure how how does uh University of New Hampshire handle it	1
agent:uh that determines how much uh vacation time they get|user:right|agent:uh for the operating staff it's on a seniority it's uh you know based on how long they've worked there	yeah i'm kind of interested because_1 i'm actually that's the route i'd like to take when i finally get my degree	0
agent:that's a that's an easy one|agent:are Americans still paying too much too many taxes|agent:[laughter]	yeah i	1
agent:so i guess i shouldn't be i shouldn't complain so much|agent:and so they everything is subsidized by their government their their taxes are higher than ours|user:yes	[laughter]	1
user:waste|user:for uh you know through uh red tape through|agent:i can go	you know uh mon[ey]- a lot of money is lost and how much effect are you getting out of your dollar and how much goes to just waste	1
agent:although two years that does sound like quite a while|agent:i mean because there's people that just plain i don't know what the percentage is but there is some percentage of people out there that just cannot get a job for whatever reason|agent:don't know if i agree with that or not	yes	1
user:yeah|agent:that'd be quite an exciting battle|agent:and to see how Congress reacts to that	um-hum	1
agent:uh-huh|user:indigent people are go and get free care|user:uh Grady Hospital where a lot of	and i pay for schools	0
agent:who has he's been on death row for seventeen years|agent:that's right but as it stands now it's not a deterrent we just had a fellow here in our county|user:and that way it can be a d[eterrent]- a deterrent	uh-huh	1
agent:uh we don't have a a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole|agent:here in Georgia|user:uh-huh	yes	1
agent:yeah|user:T is crossed every I is dotted and to make sure that everything is just right otherwise you know someone gets off on a technicality|user:there are people that are going to make sure that every	now	0
agent:there's video tape of it|user:um|user:in typically what i believe is an open and shut case where the guy is guilty there are seven eyewitnesses they saw it happen they have testified what happened	the[y]-	0
agent:uh-huh|user:well [noise] my parents were both in them_1|user:[noise]	and my father-in-law and it's a tough decision to make	1
agent:uh|user:but uh you know and it's hard to really|agent:that seems to be	know what kind of a home is run	1
user:uh [noise]|user:whereas it's you know usually pretty good|agent:yeah	uh the one my father-in-law was in had uh	1
user:incident in uh|user:and they just had a|agent:oh yeah	Dallas here	0
user:so|user:yeah|agent:uh oh	you know	1
agent:the bedroom is and you know that kind of thing so|agent:wonder where|agent:you know anywhere from five to ten times and	well	0
agent:they're also important|user:okay|agent:for me it's uh i mean like medical and you know uh benefits and dental	yeah	0
agent:j[ust]- just very little variation from there|user:really [vocalized-noise]|agent:are they like we[ll]- pretty much trained for a specific job and that what's their hired for and then uh	yeah somewhat that but then also there just isn't the ability to	0
user:perhaps somewhat even with the business|user:and i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution|agent:um-hum	uh	0
user:uh institutions are slower to|agent:um-hum|user:institutions and the corporate world in	react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where	0
user:well [noise]|agent:yeah but so what else do you think is important|agent:um-hum	the uh	0
user:he the you know the more complex your structure|user:uh i guess in innovation although|user:but if you're in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for	the uh less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through	1
user:yeah it becomes the organization instead of|user:yeah|agent:get accomplished you know	person being uh you know a part of the individual themselves	1
user:uh but uh|agent:yes okay you know where Dallas is|user:i see okay well anyway it doesn't hail from the area where you are	uh anyway uh so so anyway i use this a pe[rsonal]- personal accounting program on my Macintosh to keep track of expenses but it also has a budget feature but i don't find it very useful because it makes all kinds of assumptions that aren't	0
agent:and that is a software program that was written for your i mean that you|user:um|user:how you stand compared to last year [noise]	for Macintosh yes	1
user:and you could only see the one transaction you were working on|user:it took about three screens to do that|user:change a transaction let's say you wanted to add in interest or put in a fee or something	all the earlier transactions were hidden it was just it it you just	1
agent:to have uh some extra money|agent:sort of keeps uh i guess you would say a running record of it so that he he knows at what point uh we are going to be able to|user:right	um-hum	1
agent:[noise]|user:[noise] uh well we have a budget we go by every pay check [vocalized-noise] since i have been in the service we get paid twice a month so that's what i go by	uh	1
agent:because to me that's the only way we're ever going s[ave]- to be able to save|user:yeah|agent:and also into a retirement plan	oh yeah i	1
agent:kids his age are ready to go to college it's gonna be about seventy thousand dollars a year for college|agent:they say by the time|agent:he's five	yeah	1
agent:oh yeah is she started having do the uh working at the hospitals|user:that adds more to|user:for that because_1 she has to drive about twenty thirty minutes every day to school and that	the gas budget	1
agent:parent's didn't do that if they didn't have the money they didn't get it|agent:with me and and bef[ore]- you know|user:[laughter]	[vocalized-noise]	1
user:um-hum|agent:you know doing the sentencing|agent:i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges uh	the other thing the other thing that really bothers me about that is i think you know that	0
agent:selecting a jury and you're doing it partially if if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have|agent:when you y[ou]- when you are|agent:and uh	um-hum	1
user:i uh i- i think there is more of an ability of you know|agent:this is very true|user:gets unequal sentences	you know s[electing]- s[electing]- selecting a jury two two different juries that would	1
agent:isn't that the truth [laughter]|user:of course a lot of that's also the the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer [laughter]|agent:uh	um-hum	1
agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:yeah|agent:so i don't know [laughter]	uh	1
agent:do what they want to do|user:uh-huh|agent:the right to do what they need to	would you [vocalized-noise] uh would you	1
user:i know|agent:yeah it does and so i don't know it's kind of a perplexing problem|user:it does feel like it doesn't it	well it is because when we think about it and it isn't at all reassuring	0
agent:earlier|agent:well it's partially because we have the technology now but it's also because i think moral standards have [laughter-gone] downhill quite a bit since|agent:think	um-hum	0
user:it's going to take at least all ready this year three have been put to death|user:and uh|agent:uh-huh	and i think at this point i am for that as long you know as they've had	0
agent:a fairly lax legal system as far as protecting the criminal|agent:well in general i think we have we have|agent:yeah i- i st[rongly]- i i strongly agree i think uh	that's right	1
user:uh|agent:now where was that at|user:uh-huh	i think that was in Houston	1
user:and uh there's no doubt a case like that there's no doubt in my mind|user:the police found the child tied and starved|user:they they tied this [laughter-child]	that these people ought to get the death penalty	1
user:Well you may have a point there i|user:uh-huh|agent:no i- i certainly think punishment is in order but the death penalty because that's i am not sure that that's homicide because they didn't i i it's it was certainly wasn't intentional homicide	it's just that	0
agent:uh to live with my bother because she got tired of teenagers but uh in my house|agent:uh sometimes well she lived with us for a few years s[ix]- actually six years and then she moved|agent:sh[e]- she	[laughter]	1
agent:well it was close to a hundred percent there were things that they wouldn't cover but they like they bought her a uh|user:that's hundred percent coverage so it's that's good|user:right	hm	1
user:uh you know she's getting to the point where she almost can't be in a nursing home|user:it she's not really|user:that's the big question is um what what happens when they begin to get older i have a grandmother and	she spent some time with my parents some time now she's with an uncle of mine living with them	1
user:uh|user:but uh she's|user:my grandmother is hers is physically she's in not too bad of shape she's in her upper eighties i guess forgetting in my order	Alzheimer's i guess	0
agent:but it is|user:uh-huh|agent:um-hum i don't think we've had a case uh recently but	yeah and he i i'm uh	0
user:uh|user:because she was overturning|agent:um-hum	convictions or	0
user:i think that the sort of person who|user:um|user:i don't to me it seems unnecessary	would be deterred	1
agent:but then i- i tend to i tend to come down on the side that if if the laws were were enforced that were on the books you probably wouldn't need it|user:[noise] [noise] right it's uh|agent:you know no mistakes have been made	do you think it would be a deterrent	1
user:you know putting more|user:uh and i would say that uh|agent:um-hum	giving more attention to uh child rearing	1
user:uh|user:you're executing someone or not rather than the other end of the system where you're turning out a person who's likely to do something like that or not|user:focus more on the one end of the system where	so i think that sort of goes along with what you're saying	1
agent:where they couldn't hurt anybody else that'd be one thing|agent:you know|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:they were gonna charge a little extra|user:uh-huh|agent:and nobody wanted to go for that	right	1
agent:mine have some kind of paper thing|user:now what do they do i have cats too but they don't do anything with newspaper|agent:destroyed those	oh really	1
user:we we do have more facilities than that around here so that we they're they are trying in Dallas to do some|user:well that's funny well i- i|agent:uh-huh so now it's just a big play play time	uh curbside recycling they've got sp[ecial]- special	0
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:and that's strange because now bottles are the one thing that are totally recyclable they're the easiest and and uh you know i mean i try to keep and reuse and i	oh i even carry around uh you know like if i- i- i travel around the city a lot so that i'm frequently stopping at fast food place and eating [laughter] in the car or on the way to the next site	0
agent:that's|user:and that's hard to get rid of unless you've got there's one place here in town|user:yeah	that will take the slicks and all your junk mail and	0
agent:uh basically no[body]- nobody wants any new taxes but the upshot is that we can't properly fund uh education here|agent:and uh you know we don't have an income tax because|user:uh-huh	oh really	1
user:at say Carver High School in Atlanta|user:uh in terms of you know the per student expenditure|user:the private schools	is over eleven thousand dollars per student	0
user:[laughter]|user:and|agent:well it's cheaper to to educate uh people who are in the top ten percent than it is to have to educate the handicapped and the developmentally disabled and all that stuff	yeah but i think a lot of it is just that uh the money is wasted on bureaucracy and it's not very efficient	0
user:the government tries to do too many things that the government has no business doing you know we're spending|user:yeah i think that uh one of the reasons our taxes are so high is just that uh on on top of the inefficiencies like what i just described is|agent:what all the reasons are for that	a couple a hundred billion dollars a year to maintain troops in Europe and Asia	0
user:uh|user:you know i I one of the questions i asked the representative of Bob Carey who was there was|user:uh	and we have a projected four hundred billion dollar budget deficit this year	0
agent:oh|user:income tax and no sales tax|user:yeah in New Hampshire we have uh uh no no what we call broad base taxes no	uh	0
agent:well if you do get money back from [noise] like jobs like i'm still a student so um i only work part time so i- i get a check back|agent:um|agent:yeah i ag[ree]- i agree [vocalized-noise] i think this is about time of the year where you you just start getting	uh-huh	1
user:uh|agent:yeah|user:you know what i mean	it it really uh i should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because	1
agent:you know [laughter]|user:well it does it it it it does seem that uh the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend|agent:it's just	uh it's almost like they'll spend as much as the they were were they're allowed to collect you know	1
agent:yeah it isn't there's not much out there that's fair [laughter-that's] for sure [laughter]|user:doesn't seem fair to me|agent:hm	right	1
agent:um-hum|user:that's the one i watch i usually keep up with TV i don't i am a student so i really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff|agent:uh NBC	so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't	1
agent:more than just a blurb about it that the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story|agent:or anything that actually had had|agent:you know first thing you know for anything of you know	yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:found it so incredibly watered down and|agent:[noise] read the story and just	well in	0
agent:they are trying to get the you know most emotional response for|user:it real personal moment|agent:uh-huh	yeah it didn't seem like there was like much coverage of the story but just the play on	0
agent:um you know you know not saying that we shou[ld]- that we that we definitely should have been there or we shouldn't have been there but it just seemed like you know|user:yeah|agent:you know i mean it just it just seemed to lack any sort of debate	they kept just showing [vocalized-noise] you know how great we were doing and it never really showed what actually	0
user:and then they get paid for recycling it so [laughter] i don't know|agent:yeah|user:and you've got to pay for them to pick it up and stuff	if that's very fair or not	1
agent:tin cans and they don't collect cardboard|agent:but they don't collect newspaper and they don't collect|user:yeah	yeah	1
agent:and so all the bags and all the stuff that's four or six doesn't get [laughter-recycled]|user:yeah|agent:you know uh you know uh they say all these plastics are recyclable but nobody will take anything on beyond a two	yeah and uh an[d]- you know and if it's recyclable why can't they just throw it in with the rest of the plastic and stuff you know it's just	1
agent:yeah it's my son's cat|agent:[laughter]|user:one rotten cat	i heard a laugh in the background	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:a mutt|user:huh we have a a mutt well we we named it Hooper because that's where we got it from	[laughter] uh some lady	0
agent:oh uh-huh|user:it's kind of good training i mean we've been trying for kids but|agent:you feel like [laughter]	right now we haven't had any but	1
agent:and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs|user:um-hum|agent:not mutts but mixes you know like one or one or two mix	that's what we found ours is uh like a Cockapoo	0
agent:he was jus[t]- he was just too big um|agent:when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was uh you know was a pet and and it was a dog that we gotten|agent:and we	um-hum	1
user:part of the city has been given these uh|user:they have a trial section that uh|user:we are not doing a whole lot here in Arlington about it uh	plastic garbage cans where you are suppose to separate and put it out	0
agent:so they are trying to get urban renewal going and they one of the things that this farmer's market does is collect plastic|user:[laughter]|agent:and it's not the safest neighborhood there is	uh-huh	1
agent:end up having a savings is at your landfill last so much longer|agent:but where you|user:um-hum	yes i know and we have that problem [laughter] but uh	1
agent:there has been a Goodyear tire store that has been servicing my car for a number of years|agent:oh you know that's one thing that kind of bothered me i now when i i use to get my o[il]- my oil changed when i go down to South Carolina|user:used oil car oil	uh-huh	0
user:uh-huh|user:[laughter]|user:uh	yeah i was called uh once	0
agent:uh-huh|user:-[be]cau[se]- it was a civil case and you got to hear every little detail about how these guys had dealt with each other|agent:right	and uh	0
agent:uh-huh|user:if if anybody owed anybody any money back how much did they owe|user:uh was it you know what was it and if it was something	and not only how much was	1
agent:an equal balance|user:maybe by knocking off extreme cases on both sides you end up with|user:so maybe	maybe	1
user:yeah it would almost be as if|agent:i mean if they haven't formed some sort of opinion i don't uh i don't know what i'm trying to say really but it just|agent:i guess that's the one thing that i [laughter-would] think is wrong with it i don't know what you'd about it but those people are are not going to be	if it if they could somehow say hey having an opinion's okay	0
agent:i mean all you do is to get guns|agent:a lot of the stuff that|user:um	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah|user:uh in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon|agent:but it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it	you know or on probation or [vocalized-noise] you know other obvious things like that	0
agent:because [vocalized-noise]|agent:it has|user:you know country that you know uh where they do have a lot more gun control like England and places like that you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much	well i mean yeah the uh the in comparing you know p[er]- per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States	0
agent:yeah i know Dallas is|user:i'm not really sure how bad it is i've i've not really had that many problems with it but i mean apparently we we were ranked pretty high up|user:uh	uh	1
agent:but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it|user:uh-huh|agent:well now when i first moved to Dallas i moved up here by myself and uh my dad gave me a gun	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh|agent:[noise] well that's why i ended up giving it back to him i thought well you know i don't want it if i don't know how to oper[ate]- you know if i don't really know how to use it and i just didn't want the responsibility	um	1
agent:you know where i used to work we had what we called tree boxes that's just what we called them_1|user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:well um as far as TI's concerned i'm not sure um and|agent:so um what else do they do in the Dallas area|user:uh-huh	uh i've heard uh you know uh in residential situations i live in a dorm and i've heard in residential situations uh like in Plano	0
agent:there are areas that can recycle the the tin cans like your you know vegetable things come in and um|agent:you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other or the uh even uh [noise]|agent:that sounds good there's i i've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where you know from the kitchen where	um-hum	1
agent:[noise] i do that i think people are becoming more aware|agent:so|user:um-hum	well that's good	1
user:i guess|agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh	uh i don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget but i basically	0
agent:i'll just take two hundred and twenty out and i put it in parenthesis i take it out of the right line total|agent:what i do on my money market account for my taxes for instance which amount to uh an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month|agent:saving in and i also have got a checking account besides that but	um-hum	1
user:to [vocalized-noise] put a little bit away and|user:making every effort to|user:an amount in my mind and i'm	you know increase the amount i need for a down payment or whatever	1
agent:[noise]|user:but if you're rolling it over every three years it might|user:right	be advantageous to do that	1
agent:those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in uh you know it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say|user:and i'm hoping i'll be have a slow period before i need that again [laughter]|agent:um-hum	right	1
agent:i'm not really from Texas i just live down here now i've i've lived down here a couple years|user:yeah|agent:yeah it is but i'm not really from [laughter]	oh you're just living down there	1
user:i|user:yeah i just about all well i live in Minneapolis and|agent:really	well actually i live in Florida but i am staying in Minneapolis for a year	0
agent:dear and elk hunting|agent:yeah uh when i was in Colorado we went|agent:so	yeah	1
user:yeah if there is if there's a way you know to limit it|agent:i you know i'm not for it|user:yeah	t[o]- to people that that i don't know [vocalized-noise]	0
user:i don't know i guess|user:but uh|user:yeah it's one of those things	i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like	1
user:and so it's like i don't know i[t]- it it does it takes the sport out of it for me i would much rather have a bow any time [laughter]|agent:right|user:you know you might do the same thing	yeah	0
agent:uh|user:is it seven o'clock there|agent:yeah	you guys central	1
agent:uh they don't really hardly use any glass|agent:at least when it comes to like uh Coke and Pepsi|agent:uh i have not seen a whole lot of glass but the same time in this area	huh so they know um	1
agent:i i really don't live in the same county as what you'd call Atlanta central but there's several counties that count as Atlanta|agent:uh yeah uh pretty much|user:so um do you actually live in Atlanta	um-hum	1
agent:the central uh part of the city the downtown area|agent:yeah the the|user:um more than one county the city limits would actually fall into more than one county	um-hum	1
agent:uh to help on on that sort of thing that would that would make it a lot easier|agent:grocery stores|agent:that that should be more available we should have more containers in all city uh uh and all the	right	1
agent:has a uh|user:oh okay that's|agent:[noise] uh well w[ell]- Dow Jones for example have a	interesting	1
user:do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader|user:uh do you do you get any uh|user:but uh yeah it	like more long term	0
user:[laughter-yeah]|agent:that's right well even if it's not technical if it's um social thing or or whatever it doesn't matter if i'm expert in it they usually make mistakes which leads me to believe that the things i'm not expert in that they're telling me lies|agent:it	yeah yeah do you by mistakes do you do you mean just like honest mistakes or do you think they're deliberate sorts of things	1
user:again i don't watch TV news that much now if i had access to CNN i would watch TV news more|user:whatever|user:i haven't really noticed them doing that but	um	0
agent:i can see why an employer wouldn't want to have employees that are on drugs|agent:but|agent:i guess i generally feel against it	right	1
agent:right|user:yeah it always should be mandatory for some uh positions such as those|user:right	but um	1
agent:especially young people here in Philadelphia|agent:they need to be you know people wouldn't be getting into trouble as much if they|agent:and aren't on drugs	right	1
user:so um from that perspective i can i'd see the|agent:uh-huh|user:it's something i may do eventually	need for drug testing	1
agent:uh-huh|user:we have one that is going to be starting kindergarten next year and uh|user:[laughter] well i've got preschoolers so	i don't know if i'm real comfortable with the public schools at this point but um	0
agent:the curriculum in the public schools is just too soft or something|agent:that they've|agent:it just seems like	yeah they're i feel like they're trying to teach a lot of um they're taking the role of the parent and trying to teach a lot of	0
user:w[ell]- [noise] well he works for Frito-Lay but they had a|user:uh for a company that|user:one of the things that uh my husband works for	a guy come in um talking about some of the new IBM	0
agent:right|agent:uh-huh [noise]|user:which is uh they can write stories and and learn to write on computers so at least uh the school district that we're in has you know computers that they begin on	and i really feel like	0
agent:right|agent:[laughter-uh-huh]|user:useless [laughter-degree] [laughter-in] [laughter-the] [laughter-world] it's like why did they do this to people [noise] and um so you have to you know you have to	uh you really have to work with	0
agent:i'm an associate professor in electrical and computer engineering and computer science|user:wow what do you do|agent:six or seven thousand employees	are you	1
user:oh yeah|agent:uh the additional amount you have to pay to cover a family has gone up quite rapidly|agent:and i wouldn't be real surprised if that's the case um [noise] uh yeah they people are uh complaining because the rates for families uh wh[at]- you know the the uh [noise]	yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:and you would sort of think that the people who have one income kind of need it more|agent:better in the sense that that people who had only one income in the family would get as much as people who had two	yeah	0
agent:we've we've gone from small cars and sports cars to station wagons and a van a mini van|user:well that makes a big [laughter-difference] doesn't it [laughter] it's kind of like well if they're|agent:well it depends on whether i have to buy my next car before or after my children are out of the house [laughter]	right a little more domestic there	1
user:some of the things are not that good about it and Ford sales have been really bad in terms of cu[stomer]- uh customer service at least for me|user:but|user:and it's been a pretty good truck	so it's i don't know i[t's]- it's kind of disappointing	0
agent:yeah|user:and uh he generally goes with i think the Astro Van|agent:yeah	um it's the only one that has a standard six cylinder which is real important to him but	0
user:um-hum|user:yeah|user:you know	oh that'd be a definite yeah that'd be the way to go for sure	0
agent:Jeffrey hasn't figured out yet just you know it's like who want oh Jeffrey's only three you know and th[e]- but the other ones aren't very old either|user:[laughter]|agent:sitting in behind our house and the kids are convinced the older two kids are convinced that that's going to be their cars	how old are they	1
agent:oh neat|agent:yeah|user:yeah a big factor for me is is ergonomics and and in terms of control and display design that's that's what i'm going into for my degree	and so that's that's something i really try to consider a little more heavily heavily than most people probably do	0
agent:no|user:you don't have children|agent:no	and my children are in their twenties now so	0
user:no it's really scary and there does seem to be more and more of that if people are doing it|agent:and she didn't take very good care of the kids and you know you don't want to send your kids to place like that|agent:and that it was just dirty and	instead of grandmothers and aunts and you know	0
agent:[laughter]|user:i mean you know|user:yeah but that's what i've heard is that that you've got to earn an awful lot	a lot of times the wife's money basically covers what you have to pay out so that doesn't help	1
agent:yeah|user:it felt good to be there when they got home from school um those were the stories that|user:but at the same time uh	that that i got to hear it was even hard to get their father to get to hear them you know they would come home and they'd say all this and then	0
agent:um yeah my mom stayed home um she had four kids and she stayed home with all of us until i got into about kindergarten and then she went um back to work after|user:well what about you and your own background di[d]- did your mother or father stay home or di[d]- did they work or|agent:i'm not really sure [laughter-i] [laughter-haven't] looked into [laughter] i don't need it [laughter]	and so you so you were in school	1
agent:okay|user:uh-huh|agent:uh would admit to the fact that that these drugs might impair their abilities	yeah	1
user:uh you know i could see the need for it so i i went along with it|agent:[noise]|user:and i know a lot of people refused to a lot especially at the nuclear plant or would uh you know strongly object to it but	i i think if i were a clerical worker for instance though uh and really couldn't have effected anybody else i'm not sure that i'd	1
agent:[laughter] so bu[t]- i I just went through one recently and uh the place i just transferred jobs not too long ago and so i went through the whole process|agent:right|user:right probably alcohol has more of an effect for for a shorter period of time	uh-huh	1
agent:very good|agent:[noise]|user:[noise] how's the quality of air in Portland	really	1
user:i think a lot i think m[ost]- well i think most of our problems caused by automobile emissions|user:um|user:it's it it's quite often you know be a very hazy sort of day you know because there'll just be this pollution hanging in the air	because_1 you know it's a very you know mobile city	1
user:i th[ink]- i think i think we really suffer because you know we don't have any sort of an organized mass transit system any sort of you know like high speed rail|user:in[dustry]- industry pollution but it just seems that|user:you know having regulations at least in the last twenty years or so about	or even you know even even you know decent regular passenger rail across the country	0
agent:until bad things happen that cause the|agent:people will move in until|agent:he said in a in a desirable area	um-hum	1
agent:then air pollution will get bad or something else|user:um-hum|agent:if they come along and they add new freeways so let's say they reduce traffic congestion	um-hum	1
user:and i go to school at Georgia Tech which is pretty much located in the heart of downtown or|agent:okay downtown|user:i basically live downtown	within a mile from the heart of downtown	1
user:okay|agent:shoot for|agent:generally gonna	um	1
agent:yeah|user:and|user:so we have the four pay checks with that works out nice because we get paid every week	so that does help that helps a lot	1
agent:right yeah we found that um|user:real short or|user:and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one and then the next pay check we're	[noise]	1
user:everything that we bought with you know|user:a[nd]- and we did this we're not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down|user:write down	every paycheck	0
agent:stick to that amount|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:it kind of forced us to uh	just stick to that uh-huh that is	1
agent:[noise]	[noise] i guess that starts it um	1
agent:[noise]|user:so and you so i'll get to buy it at five sixty f[our]- four and turn around the same day|agent:wow	the only down side is they do it as a withholding off your uh	0
agent:and|agent:health plan|agent:and i get a pretty good um	yeah but that that's definitely a good thing to have [vocalized-noise] especially these days	1
agent:yeah uh|user:but you know i'd much [laughter-rather] get the eight[een]- eighteen percent minimum return on the stock and use that for the house|user:and you know i can always take the money off of that if i wasn't saving up for the house i would be putting money into a 401K	but yeah you know me[dical]- medical is good you know we get a good program here what's basically a hundred percent coverage for about twenty bucks a month	0
user:so i just have them_1 pull you know five hundred it means i pay like|agent:right|user:but you know if if you know you know so you wanna underestimate a little bit so like you know i know i easily have a thousand dollars or five hundred dollars a year of dental and and misce[llaneous]- miscellaneous medical and deductibles	you know as opposed to paying like you know eight hundred dollars	0
user:i don't like working in an organization where you're really deep in the tree|user:you know it depends how flat it is if it's um|user:um	because_1 then you start to feel like you've got no real you know power to change anything	1
agent:you know they have that type of music but they just have different words|user:um-hum|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
user:no i'm more into um older rock like psy[chedelic]- the psychedelic|agent:[laughter] what kind of rock music do you listen to do you li[sten]- listen to like that really heavy metal stuff or|user:i have a lot of friends that like country music [laughter]	era like uh	0

EMPTY	[noise]	1
user:considering i don't think it affects my job and like nobody|agent:uh-huh|user:lifestyle choices consi[dered]- i i don't think	um	0
user:there's a lot of things out there that will|user:and yeah well also i what i think is a a problem is that there's a|agent:uh yeah and not to mention the legal ones which they don't even care about	actually	0
user:he was drummed out of the Air Force and he spent i think something like seven years|agent:right|user:and he he tested positive and he it ruined his career he he uh	working you know before he was able to	0
agent:uh-huh|user:uh you know you read things about uh like train car conductors|user:oh you know but i but i also	uh [laughter] which	0
agent:do a meaningful test like a performance test uh|user:[noise]|agent:well i can see there be yeah i mean i actually it's some some mixed mixed feeling about feel i mean i feel like okay if you're going to do testing	um-hum	1
agent:well a lot of people say that that would|user:you know|user:should we really be talking about [vocalized-noise] what should we be should we have legalized drugs	[noise]	1
user:uh i i'm in i think we're pretty much in agreement uh in Texas this|agent:right|user:[vocalized-noise] yeah that sh[ouldn't]- shouldn't happen but unfortunately it it can	death by injection seems about as civilized a way as you can do it i guess	1
agent:what they came to earth to do you know what they're here to do to try to make life um the best that they can|agent:then there really isn't much point to them going on anyway because they pretty much ruined|user:[noise]	um-hum	1
user:oh i'd i|user:um-hum|agent:if that shouldn't be capital punishment but if they're the high ones that are making these drugs and importing them i think that you could consider that because in essence they're taking lives	i'd go with the ones on the street corner	0
agent:yeah|user:uh|agent:[laughter]	as a Christian	0
agent:no no i'm in i'm in college i'm just a sophomore in college|user:are you are you married|agent:uh no i don't i don't	are you	1

user:and uh|agent:um-hum|user:i attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling	i was kind of interested to hear because_1 they had some people from the EPA and lots of different places	1
agent:um-hum|user:the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the EPA|user:solutions actually they were	but he had a lot of uh facts to to	0
agent:um-hum|user:in Cash Valley the community here|user:yeah we're doing some here in	there's uh	0

agent:that uh|user:um-hum|agent:and it is a tough decision to make [laughter]	does he he live at home now and	1
agent:we're living longer so therefore you know|agent:way medicine is today It's keeping us alive longer and|agent:with the	you almost like to have some place that's	0
agent:well more or less but he is almost to the point that he's legally blind so that really is what bothers us uh he could start a fire|user:oh it it right now though he's independent enough to to take care of day to day or or ha[ve]-|agent:other solution there is eventually we're going to have to put him in a home some place	oh	1
agent:okay_1 so|user:uh-huh [vocalized-noise] yeah|user:yeah	well	1
agent:isn't it their like [vocalized-noise] um income averaging or something like that|user:you know my base line is average and i don't get that back on the other half back|user:you know so due to the nature of the business it um	there was that went away a few years ago	1
user:make it desirable|agent:and you don't uh|user:yeah if you're unfortunate enough not to buy a house which if your life style doesn't	yeah	1
agent:a regressive tax or a progressive tax|agent:well it depends if it's you know a|user:so uh you know what's going in -[ha]s got to be a lot more -[th]an going out if it can pay for all that stuff	well i'm not really talking about	0
agent:more money as you earn more money so you have a greater ability to pay you don't really need that extra income to survive|agent:um i[t's]- it's like um you know a graduated tax which means you pay|user:yeah	right	1
user:it's not taxed but if you buy it in a can|user:paper container|user:and if you buy your orange juice in a	[rec[oncentrated]-/concentrated] uh concentrated then it is taxed	1

agent:[vocalized-noise] uh-huh|user:and if we could have us if we could have a thirty two hour work week well that'd happen is that|user:Saturday you you get off but Sunday you're getting ready for Monday	for every four people we'd give another job	0
agent:right|user:what happen[s]- and they where they have to spend out a lot of money for one particular it's called a a group|user:and and things like that	well what'll what happens then is that	0
agent:well i do wor[k]- uh research in computer science and i've just been doing that for a few years now so|agent:uh|user:what kind of what kind of jobs have you done	uh-huh	1

agent:northern Alabama i'm into rock climbing a little bit so|agent:you know one day trips where i'll i'll maybe drive up to Alabama somewhere like in a|agent:so that's kind of put a cramp in my camping style so late lately i've just kind of for outdoorsy type stuff i've pretty much been	oh that's neat [noise]	1
agent:well this time of year [vocalized-noise] it's gets really beautiful down the springtime in Georgia with all the dogwoods and|agent:[laughter]|user:he said he'd lived on a farm too long and that was too much like camping [laughter-anyway] true camping	i bet	1
user:have they oh well that is really nice|user:[laughter]|agent:they're getting started early this year i'll tell you that much the so the dogwoods are already starting to bloom	well i'm sure there are a lot of camping places around here but we get so wrapped up in everyday life we don't get take time to	1
user:it's just coincidental that that's the way it is but my feelings happen to be that i'm against capital punishment|user:and uh|user:live in New York and capital punishment is illegal in this state	uh and	0
user:i don't think it's a matter of the of the murderer's rights i think it's a matter of our uh|agent:does he really have the right to [vocalized-noise] continue living and be a burden on society|agent:just blatantly slaughtered painfully killed ten people	penal people's rights and i don't think they have the right to take away a life no i think definitely there should be uh severe punishment	0
user:but i think life imprisonment is a much better alternative|agent:def[initely]-|user:and making them earn their their pay	to uh people that perform crimes i think also people that are prone to commit a murder are not going to be deterred by the thought	0
user:people it just seems so barbar[ous]- barbaric|user:i can't see executing|user:but uh i i can't see	in these times	1
user:um|user:okay|agent:i'm one of those guys [laughter]	i guess uh	0
agent:not any real significant benefits my health insurance is very minimal|agent:but|user:uh-huh	right	1
agent:so that some people can get them and some people can't and it's like having two classes of income some that is taxed and some that is not|user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh	right	1
agent:but on the other hand i[n]- in the curr[ent]- state of the current system|user:that would be a wonderful idea|user:right that's	uh-huh	1
agent:federal retiree benefits and the state retiree benefits|agent:so he got the|user:um-hum	wow	1
agent:what kind of job are you thinking about getting when you get out|user:right|user:um-hum	oh i'm i'm just not entirely sure i have only been working here for one quarter this is my first quarter here and uh	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and uh we do a lot of research for the federal government|user:and uh we do research uh the one i'm in the lab i'm in does research in microwaves and antennas	so a lot of our uh expenses are you know covered by the federal government	1
user:um|agent:i they they've never had a job i mean they've never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes i know they pay taxes but they don't|agent:and	yeah	1
user:uh Congress person|user:and expect you know his first day to be an effective|user:and that you know you can't just send someone off to Washington	uh i think i think there really is a there's a lot they need to learn you know when you get there	1
user:um|user:uh bothers me about our system is just that|user:uh the other the other thing that that	in	0
agent:but then you have you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin uh the C i A is moving out to West Virginia|agent:i think i think that that's true|agent:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:uh during the incidents where they were you know like they aren't paying their their restaurant bills and they're bouncing checks all over the place|agent:i heard on the radio back a a few weeks ago|agent:all with all the perks that we've given them i mean	uh	1
user:right|agent:that other part of New Jersey exists actually very|user:yeah	[laughter]	1
agent:you get the car that's in the accident and muffler falls off or something and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that|user:yeah and it's like|agent:oh e[ven]- even where you do have the inspections you know the inspection is once a year	sure	1
agent:which is one of the major fluor[ocarbons]- [chlorofar/chlorofluorocarbons] -[chloro]fluorocarbons|user:right|agent:of uh the uh freon	yeah	0
user:i don't know that's that's kind of an interesting situation there uh|user:exactly exactly uh those of kind of yeah those are joining arguments but uh|agent:or or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way where we got to	what they don't realize	0
agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:okay so you've got yeah those are actually|agent:mostly i've mostly been in the east coast so that's going between Atlanta Washington DC area	areas that are hit pretty hard i would think	1
agent:well i think there's a big waste of our tax dollar|agent:[noise]|user:it sounds like you feel like taxes are probably too high	it does seem that way i was trying to think of whether	0
agent:right well you know i've i can handle the i can handle the tax m[oney]- the amount of taxes that i pay i can handle that|user:but they may also get better value for the dollar that's the real question|user:seem to recall that uh many many other countries have higher tax rates than ours	uh-huh	1
agent:the two counties that i pay taxes in are|agent:i'm from Texas too but um i think my|agent:i'm course i'm	[noise]	0
user:you if you gonna take a job|user:uh my feelings are is that i i don't really think that they should test for drugs that|user:this is for everybo[dy]- for for private and commercial sector	you know and then they say well we're we're gonna	1
user:a recourse if they say well it's it's do you have a positive you know and you say well no that's not really true and they say well okay well here|user:a|user:and your your your privacy is is just taken away from you just you don't really have	you have to go an[d]- and here you go pee in the bottle an[d]- and we get somebody and we can watch you pee in the bottle and we'll see if i[f]- if if i[f]- if it what happens this time and they they just [noise] that the testing p[art]- part of it is just really bad	1
user:warrant executing a person and the reason i think that is because i really don't have the|user:i really don't think that uh there are any crimes that|user:[noise] oh let's see um crimes and circumstances actually i'm i'm against capital punishment um probably not for the reasons that a lot of people are i'm against it because	belief that uh any	0
agent:uh because_1 they'd sit there and i mean their quality of life is horrible|user:yeah|agent:well um yeah in a sense that you know that individual is removed from direct contact with society but that individual then becomes a burden to society a non productive burden	do you i	1
agent:exactly exactly|agent:right right [laughter]|user:you know then when you set up the rubber room you know it's so uh [laughter] it's so antiseptic that it's almost drives the person crazy if he isn't crazy already and so isn't that cruel and unusual punishment	um	0
user:you know terminate somebody if they have stepped across that line because_1 i think there are probably a lot of instances where|user:to|user:that to have a society you necessarily have to	um	0
agent:container yeah yeah|user:um-hum into the different box|agent:matching color uh	yeah [vocalized-noise] up here like New Hampshire doesn't uh well where i am uh we don't have any recycling we don't even have a bottle bill	0
user:and i|agent:yeah|user:i think i could do more	there's a big problem here with like landfills	0
agent:um-hum|user:and it's like you you have to like if you can turn the can in to to any store and they have to pay you a nickel for it|agent:oh	but	0
agent:right|user:they can just throw that back into the pot and that just gets melted back up and that's not a problem|user:they they could make money on because aluminum can be	but um like the plastic ones you s[aid]- like you were saying	0
agent:and usually convenience means waste [laughter]|agent:you know if it's not convenient people don't want it|agent:everything is	i	1
user:yeah uh well tha[t's]- that's a good point the only uh|agent:any number of other things as well|agent:um concern over somebody being under the influence while they're at work but they could easily be under the influence of alcohol or	the only thing i really disagree with is	0
user:that|user:um having drugs|user:if someone knows that there's there's an even greater chance that they['re]- they're going to get caught	that tha[t]- that would act to discourage them that it would um	0
user:that are using drugs maybe legalizing them and and trying to help those that you know having the resources there to help someone|user:in thinking that that it's we're not doing a good job at fighting the war you know in in trying to crack down on people|user:um	um would be a better idea but and and i agreed with him somewhat i could see his point	0
user:that's a good point that's a good point and although although alcohol consumption did jump|agent:the consequences of that and it's ultimate uh repealment|agent:i guess one uh one other data point is the old um prohibition here in the US	right after prohibition it did come back down	1
user:well i'll tell you the truth when it uh when it was introduced to Texas Instruments it was a lot of hard feeling now my initial reaction was|agent:uh|agent:i guess not being not being involved in it	benign i uh really didn't feel as a matter of fact i was sort of sympathetic in	0
user:influence on|user:uh a dangerous|user:uh drug use is	other people in society	1
user:uh this requires a very strong minded management and uh uh a supervisory|agent:but you know|user:and of course there're problems with doing that you realize because	it requires the supervisor to be brass balled i[n]- in a sense	0
agent:um-hum|user:drugs is not a problem at Texas Instruments and the corporation i think are going through this exercise mainly to remain in the good graces of their customer the government|user:u[nproductive]- unproductive nature of it that basically uh	uh rather than to improve their productivity by stamping out drug use because the	0
user:right well we have it once a week they just started it not too long ago and we have newspaper and glass and then like a very select group of [laughter] plastics|agent:so you have to know what night they're doing it and you're not allowed to put anything out any other night so [laughter]|user:oh okay	um but it's not real convenient like you said for lots of other things	0
user:but they're pretty inconvenient to get to and and those you do have to sort and and most people don't have room|user:um we have a couple of collection places around|agent:[laughter] uh-huh	you know in their house for ten or twenty different bins	0
agent:right|user:and the school keeps saying no because uh there's a lot of people in in town homeless people who collect cans|agent:right	for a living and	0
agent:well not for individuals but like my company uh started doing recycling because it became mandatory in the state i i think it was mandatory in the state but they did it and they started a recycling program|user:so it's not a real profitable thing for for people to do|agent:[laughter] yeah	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:i get to pick my own doctor and they have really good benefits|agent:and they're it's pretty cheap per month and they	uh	0
agent:but they're not they have their own|user:uh-huh|agent:no that's just me but they can be i have that option but it's more money	i see	0
agent:uh it does [laughter]|agent:they|agent:yeah yeah they have	[laughter-yeah] that's just what you want to hear about	0
user:and some of which pay very little|user:you know like everything|user:um so you can choose all these different plans some of which pay	uh you can also choose an HMO	0
agent:there's none whatsoever and it can get expensive|user:yeah it's nice|agent:coverage but there's	yeah it can uh at least it's not like medical where it can really go through the roof	0
agent:yeah|user:yeah the doctors end up having to come up with some ailment|agent:especially when they're younger	to cover the uh	0
agent:yeah but you can have your own doctor|user:i see so they they're preferred providers|agent:and if and if your doctor's on that list then most of your benefits are better because those doctors are in a chain that works with the insurance company	or is that a	1
agent:uh-huh|user:[noise] i don't uh subscribe to cable be[cause]- because of the poor service and also uh|user:well i would probably be a junkie or s[omething]- watch CNN a lot but i don't uh	because well i uh i give to the United Way and so i figured that amount of money i just donate to that	1
agent:right|user:compete with a lot of other sources of newspap[er]- of news|agent:uh-huh	and	0
user:uh but i- i don't know i guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype look at the [noise]|agent:sure was|agent:[laughter-right] yeah	the Smith trial	0
user:i subscribe to this this thing it's free inside the company and it's called Intellect and and they basically uh|user:but uh one of the ways that i get information is uh everyday when i log in on the computer|user:yeah i guess that's true	type out abstracts which are r[eally]- really literally	1
user:i mean you don't want it to it's not cheap and the thing fails when it does|user:yeah if it was designed with reasonable prudence stuff wouldn't get loose and um|user:either whether the problem's due to leaks or due to failures i would think that um	so i'm kind of surprised it became as much of an issue as it has	1
user:and um|user:so i probably contributed my share there|agent:[laughter]	kind of interesting course um there is talk about legislation that would ban	0
user:so the amount of dollars spent per|user:that's moderately high|user:and if it flies a hundred hours a year	unit of pollution saved	0
user:the pollution issue as a property rights issue if um somebody dumped their garbage in your front lawn|user:you know i've always viewed it as um|user:sounds like another issue um	um regularly	0
agent:[laughter]|user:i think it was ten [laughter-people] [laughter]|agent:or innocent i you didn't say which way it went	no it's the funny	1
agent:well a fairly objective uh thing uh i don't know if there really needs to be all that much discretion in sentencing once you've determined what crime the person is guilty of|agent:i- i think that by the time you get to that point all the facts have been settled the person's been convicted and the punishment should be|agent:uh	yeah	0
agent:[noise] so do you exercise|user:[noise]	yeah i just started about uh two months ago	0
agent:uh yeah|user:okay_1 so you consider that your exercise|agent:i'm outside a lot i work on airplanes so i do a lot of walking there [laughter]	yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:yeah [laughter] well it's kind of hard on the joints|agent:a little bit i don't you know really particular like running but [laughter]	there's a lot of other things to do	1
user:yeah|agent:[noise] yeah|user:or get out when it's cold or whatever	so	0
agent:yeah well i went on a trip once and me and the the guy i went with we|user:so and we encourage each other|agent:[noise]	so	1
user:but it's hard when|agent:yeah [vocalized-noise]|user:it's kind of hard to it's like you have to schedule a time and stick to it	you don't have somebody to do it with you it's easy to just say well i'm not gonna do it today but i'll do it tomorrow and then you never do it [laughter]	1
user:i don't know do a lot of walking like you are and|user:you can um|user:yeah well maybe you can	do calisthenics or something i don't know	1
agent:no not really well that's part of what the brochure said too you know twenty thirty minutes a day and|user:and that's not too much time|agent:oh	yeah	1
agent:um-hum|user:well i- i do take care of pretty much [laughter-all] of the stuff for for my wife and for me and um|user:um	i embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial all we all i do is	0
agent:what little we have [laughter] so that's what i do|agent:um just real careful with the money you know|user:um-hum	yeah it's a pretty	1
agent:you know it's so much easy easier you know if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person it's like|user:uh|agent:i don't have too many weaknesses but i found out a credit card was one of them_1	hum	1
user:i don't understand the idea of paying somebody to|agent:do you|user:yeah	to do it	1
user:that that i|user:i don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer to too much stuff like that because i wanna make sure|agent:things to add up so	i keep	0
agent:what i see these days as one side you know some one side's mad|agent:uh discussion as opposed to just|agent:you know i've i've read other things that i i wish i could see a uh an informed	uh-huh	1
agent:[vocalized-noise] the way the article was written was a terrible injustice|agent:which|agent:agreed that the fine should be so much and then the judge came along and set aside the judgement	oh really	1
agent:so that's what i'm kind of worried about|user:yeah yeah|user:yeah	well i think in a way it also depends on what kind of trial it is	0
agent:that it costs more to execute somebody tha[n]- than it does to keep them_1|agent:yeah and then i was reading in the paper just this morning it's interesting because_1 i had forgotten i guess that i wrote this little topic down|user:yes that's similar to Georgia uh	that's probably true considering	1
agent:what what kind of work do you do|agent:um-hum|user:if the person who's gonna commit the crime knew that they were gonna be punished severely possibly capital punishment	uh i'm a research engineer i work uh f[or]- with Georgia Tech	1
agent:some of them_1 in the penal system|agent:and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible|user:um	so that's a difficult situation	1
agent:are you for it|agent:um-hum|user:hum yeah i don't i don't certainly capital punishment isn't gonna solve a lot of problems but	uh	1
user:yes i read about that|agent:well you know somebody elected that recently|user:well you always have [laughter-castration]	[laughter]	1
agent:uh-huh|user:i think they cover AIDS but what they do is um if you know you apply for for to get a a insurance policy|agent:diseases like that	they'll um check to see if you're HIV positive and if you are not only will they not give you um a policy but they'll	0
agent:boy that's a good one|user:but um|agent:yeah	[laughter]	0
user:i mean it seems that you know|user:um-hum|agent:i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it's you know where it's predominated so far because it's you know it's bound to spread	it's just you know of	0
user:of|user:so do do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support|user:um	um people	1

user:yeah it's it's more in depth less broad well actually it's probably isn't less broad but it's just more in depth|agent:and it's more in depth|user:what you'd generally think of as news but it's recent material	and uh	1
agent:that's i think that's a good magazine|agent:[noise] yeah actually y[ou]- you mention Newsweek i- i- i do like uh US News and World Report i don't get to read it as much as i like but|user:listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something [laughter]	yeah i think they're about the same	0

agent:but|user:well [vocalized-noise] there's there's actually some other good ideas that have come up where|user:sure	for example i think this was actually originated in Oklahoma city on the uh	0
agent:oh for heaven sakes that's right that's amazing because_1 we use to live in Baltimore|user:which they also think it is good because it makes the roads prettier|user:yes	because_1 they sparkle	1

agent:{toundar} T O U N D A R|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:which is a um	oh okay i know what that is yeah	1
user:pro[duce]-|user:and i guess one of the problem is is that the goal isn't to pro[duce]-|agent:right	-[pro]duce the technology the goal is to produce the buck the the all mighty dollar	0

agent:yeah for uh w[ell]- they they actually took sort of the reverse approach to start with they just decided well we won't we won't let anybody use anything styrofoam [laughter] so they stopped buying coffee cups [laughter-and] stuff like th[at]-|user:seems like a prime candidate for recycling though|user:[noise] that	[noise]	1
user:it's|user:yeah tha[t's]- that's one problem with uh engineering jobs is|agent:pension fund was amounted to less than three quarters of a year of salary	you you really need some sort of more flexible or portable pension	0
agent:right|user:your last salary when you left the company|user:set the benefits based on	so you know let's say you've worked there for twenty years	0
user:more opportunities because_1 there're so many things going on within the company|user:you know it's well it's actually can go both ways someth[ing]- some ways you have|user:well that's one thing you do get with a large company they're	but you also may get key holed and you are a ex type person therefore you should only work on	0

user:okay yeah i'm not real sure about that i've only been up here a little while|agent:uh Minneapolis whoever makes the [vocalized-noise]|user:probably not huh	so i'm still kind of getting the hang of it but actually i'll be back down in May	0
user:no aside from that i don't think i've worn a tie more than about once here|user:but uh|user:oh okay right great	and that's uh	0
agent:hum|user:yeah i was kind of surprised to see that actually|agent:i'm not quite that [laughter-bad]	and uh	1
agent:and little things that they point out to me when i was walking around well this was done because of this or this was done because of that|agent:McDonald Douglas some of the other new facilities i've been to there's|agent:uh uh uh	so they're actually kind of thinking it through	0

agent:you know what type of care do they need it depends if you you know if you need the bed total bed care|agent:well of course the cleanliness and the care|agent:first of all	um-hum	1
user:i- i tell you i was at an uh convalescent home last week um|agent:all those old people would just fight with you it was a riot|agent:a[nd]- and all they do is fight with each other that was i found in my [laughter-father] you know	a three hundred and twenty five patient convalescent home	1
agent:it was pretty good it was nothing to write home about it's typical you know it's typical um|user:what um do the[y]- did you find um that they offered sufficient dietary maintenance that would be something i would|user:um-hum	would uh	1
agent:there was nothing but a college preparatory course|agent:uh|agent:Catholic high school	okay	1
agent:well a little bit of both uh the school wasn't very crowded when i went there although it's since gotten|user:too many students or too many subjects per teacher or|user:and by spreading thin you mean they	uh-huh	1
user:um-hum|agent:trained machinist to tea[ch]- teach the metal shop course let's go find one they just say well you know we have this course we need a body for it|agent:is a	uh-huh	0
user:but i think that|user:uh|user:in general	i knew other people from other public schools who got better educations	0
user:the whole system where everyone sits facing the front of the room as quiet as possible|user:and i'm just sort of turned off by the whole uh|user:you know more critically and trying to figure out what we want to do	while the teacher lectures	0
agent:[laughter]|user:no so far i'm just whining [laughter]|user:um	i haven't done anything constructive yet	0
agent:but it's also little sound bites on TV they don't really tell you much [laughter]|user:um the radio i've yet to find|agent:um-hum	[laughter] so true so true	1
agent:news {McNuggets}|user:oh buddy|user:and	[laughter-oh] [laughter-yeah] [laughter-there] [laughter-you] [laughter-go]	0
user:when uh|user:happened to cross that that beauty of a of a station|user:yeah same story here i uh	i was with a new car and all i had was an AM radio	0
user:all this other stuff all i'm seeing|user:the different candidates we got|user:but myself well li[ke]- for example with this you know the democratic race we got going here	are a couple of yahoos and uh no issues	0
user:i'll make that into a tag line in my system|user:hey there you go [laughter]|agent:no no that's a thousand pointless lies	all right [noise] oh goodness but i don't know for the most part	1
agent:yeah|user:it was right after Jeffrey Dahlmer had been apprehended|user:we had a situation here in Des Moines when um	that um the animal rights groups ran an ad which [vocalized-noise] excepted	0
user:well|agent:unfortunately not completely these days since that's where a lot of their funding is coming from is corporate underwriting|user:yeah	yeah and that's unfortunate	1
agent:little bit more experience though|user:no i'm not a beginner but i'm not a [laughter-novice] [laughter-either]|agent:yeah	yeah yeah it takes quite a bit i	0
agent:and uh hitting the ball into a net instead of letting it fly|agent:driving ranges and and that's a little bit strange getting used to swinging the club inside and|agent:and play from there but we also have a lot of indoor	yeah because_1 you don't know for su[re]- can you tell if you're slice much on those	0
agent:oh okay you did that so that must be fairly common|agent:yeah|user:um no no i wish [laughter] the the screen one	yeah well they were trying it out here is i did it about gee six or seven years ago	1
agent:evidently yeah so he uh i don't know he's got his own little golf cart that he putts over to the country club in and|user:wow i didn't know that would hu[rt]- hu[rt]- hurt you standing all the time|agent:and uh he has artificial knees he doesn't get around to well but he still plays eighteen [laughter-holes] of golf everyday	huh	1
agent:so i i figured i[t]- it might be a good investment i i better be sure and serious about getting into it or else the uh the investment isn't very good|user:[laughter]|user:[vocalized-noise]	uh-huh	1
agent:uh i think it was yeah Houston i've been hearing about that yeah|user:i guess that was down in your area uh|agent:yeah	and then here they've gone and um no surgeon could be found to	0
agent:or to perform some sort of more work than is is currently done in most prisons|user:really|agent:to repay the courts or the victims or the prisons to uh to keep them	yeah i would think there's a lot that a lot of production that c[ould]- could be done um	1
user:yeah there seems to be a lot of problems with the uh criminal justice system in America today i'm|user:very interesting|agent:yeah i mean that's really a r[eally]- r[eally]- really a lot of cost to uh to bring that to trial again	certainly no one to have the answers	1
agent:gets really out of hand|user:um-hum|agent:even all the way up through college	yes it does	1
user:and um|user:i'm in a i'm i'm in college right now|user:and i kn[ow]- i i know	we have real small classes we we're very fortunate in that we do	0
agent:if if no one cared|user:yeah|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|agent:living in the world are not important to them|agent:i feel are important to	but still you know your basic your basic English your reading and your writing and you know and some of your math	0
user:i mean i've heard some some some school districts that have that have uh|user:i don't know i- i think it's [vocalized-noise]|user:yeah	found some really unique ways about getting around the problems and	1
agent:and that's after uh twenty one years of marriage [laughter] [laughter-so] so we we've had quite an experience over the last four years of readjusting our time|user:uh-huh|agent:uh we have two they're going to be two and four years old in April	oh is that right	0
agent:um-hum|user:couple of months|user:sometimes we have uh family get togethers probably every oh	[noise] so it's kind of a different situation are you do you have a boy and a girl two boys two girls	0
agent:uh eighteen years together|agent:and the fact that we had uh|agent:uh be[tween]- between that thousand mile distance from uh relatives	um-hum	1
agent:one income two children and uh the total uncertainty of the job market now so we we pretty much stay at home|user:right|user:um	right	1
agent:um rather than and focusing more on the children's activities|user:um-hum|agent:that maybe one parent will go off with one child and another parent will go off with the other children	uh-huh	1
user:um|user:i read the paper almost everyday and|user:current events and news so	i also	1
user:uh uh the New York Times is my favorite newspaper that's what i grew up with but uh i don't spend the money on it because i know i only|agent:nope|user:no uh i used to	get to spend five or ten minutes on it and have to	0
agent:i th[ink]- well i mean i don't know you know i really have never paid that much attention to that|user:best of the Washington Post and the New York Times and they probably have a few syndicated columnists that they rotate|user:the	tha[t's]- that's what the Dallas Morning News does and the[y]- they	0
user:i i'm finding that [noise]|user:but um|agent:yeah	McNeal Lehrer	1
agent:yeah|user:seven i think and it's on channel thirteen at uh ten o'clock usually|user:well it's actually it's on a couple of times it's on channel two at	so	0
user:KRLD if i need to|user:um|user:that['s]- that's what i tune to regularly	know what the traffic's like	1
user:right|user:[laughter] right|user:[laughter]	yeah	1
agent:daily|user:was it a weekly|agent:well um it was family owned and everything so we didn't like th[e]- the way a lot of the stuff was run there	daily	0
user:well that['s]-|user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh	[noise]	1
agent:about_1 a year ago i engaged in the arduous six month prices process of getting a fire arms license|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:uh-huh well we're not all like that um	oh my [laughter]	1
agent:uh for rifle and shotgun you've got to sign the federal form but that's about it|agent:yeah|user:uh that you've gotten the fire arm permit is this for a hand gun or does are there uh there are the laws as restrictive for rifles and shot guns	i see	1
agent:oh my wife is screaming shotgun|agent:<b_aside> what was that <e_aside>|agent:you know it uh	[laughter-oh] [laughter]	1
agent:[noise]|user:[noise] Jonathan um	it seems to me that	0
user:um|user:a lot more time than the average father with his kid i mean he took his kids out|user:was gladdest about in in the relationship that he was in before that uh he spent like	ice skating and water skiing and and i mean just if there was something that that he could think of to do with them he went out and did it	0
agent:um|user:now and and it's really it's really way too late i- i mean my granddad grew up in the military you know he was always the never show your feelings but it seems like he tries real hard now to to try let his sons know that that he loves them and it's|user:i think it has been changing over the generations you know i see my granddad	i mean to some extent it's too late	0
agent:things like that not just kidding around not really meaning it but|user:[laughter]|agent:attached to mom and when i say i love you you know he says i hate you	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah well it seems like most of the people who get hurt from them_1 get hurt from handguns|user:is necessary|agent:um-hum	[noise]	1
agent:with injuries and things like that uh sound like we both agree on the fact that things like semiautomatic rifles and|agent:yeah i agree that there's a real problem with uh|agent:um-hum	sure	1
user:but|agent:yeah and i think even with a total ban there'll always be guns available|user:so without a total ban there's always going to be guns available	right	1
agent:you know g[un]- gun control certainly has a place but it's not going to be the the cure all of all society's ills|agent:so you know i[t]- i[t]- it goes to sh[ow]- i[t]- it does prove that even even|user:um-hum	sure sure	0
user:so that the so that my infant could|user:uh low ratio of of children to to care giver|user:i uh i- i had to go back to work i wanted to find someplace with a very	could really receive a lot of attention	0
user:to a uh a commercial day care service|user:and we switched over to|user:quite a number of of demands on her time	which actually is the best of of both worlds it's it's not a a big chain and they do have separate rooms for the the different developmental ages so	0
user:uh come get your child immediately uh it and that's it's it is a big disruption uh it's particularly bad in the first year|user:it's really true|user:uh your child looks like maybe he has conjunctivitis come get your child immediately whether or not	if you're back to work and	0
user:but|agent:well that's an interesting yeah|user:out of their hospital facilities	that i[t]- and it's it's an interesting way to approach it	0
agent:do you have a Mac|user:a[ll]- right|agent:uh okay uh i've got a PC	uh-huh	1
user:when i was in college i had a|user:i you know i was into|user:and to human factors and i uh	Commodore sixty four	0
user:yeah so i didn't i had to uh use uh i didn't have access to computers at work very easily everyone was wanting to use it so i|agent:oh rea[lly]- you did your dissertation with Hypercard|user:and i needed to use that for my dissertation work	bought my own and that's where i started and i bought subsequently after that uh	1
agent:uh|user:um-hum|agent:that's when i decided that a PC was like re[ally]- was more cost effective even though it was the inferior product	well as you know ge[tting]- we're getting away from that but that's why you have one at home because it was cost effective and	0
agent:uh and so i had to reply that i couldn't do it|user:uh|user:um-hum	right	0
user:uh get together a jury because there had been so much publicity about it but uh i was not selected for that one i would have been interesting i think|user:like about a hundred and fifty people [noise] before they could actually|user:although i uh i did have a chance at a criminal one they uh actually had to interview	but the i guess the question that is uh what we think of uh trial by jury [laughter]	0
user:right|agent:incident and award large damages that were really undeserving from a legal point of view|agent:uh any of the legal aspects of the	course you're uh as a juror to you're	1
user:uh you i really never knew who was really telling the truth and who wasn't|user:and when you got right down to it|user:that bothered me was the fact that i was holding in my hands possibly the life of that individual	you can't you can't go by what the	0
agent:well i think one of the problems that we have here in the United States and the the question didn't seem to focus on civil things they wa[nt]- more focus on criminals but um from my my perspective one of the problems is that in our Bill of Rights|user:one of those things you have to do i guess|agent:uh all the civic duty yeah	right	1
agent:ten thousand dollars i- i'm not exactly sure the uh the economics involved a[nd]-|user:right|user:[laughter]	well yeah what the value would be equal to today	0
agent:i don't either [laughter] neither do i [laughter] it's called scraping together [laughter]|user:i don't have a family and i don't have a budget [laughter]|agent:okay	and	1
agent:expenses and pay the bills with the rest of it [laughter]|agent:learn to to set aside a certain amount of money i[t]- you know that i could spend each week for like lunch and all this other ki[nd]- you know|agent:i pretty well i- i get pai[d]- i work for the state um i get paid like once a month so i i kind of	so you don't keep actual records of what your expenses are and what your inco[me]- what you income is and stuff	1
user:i should really do that [laughter]|user:you know|user:and i never actually checked to see if my balance matched the bank's and the other day i was well a couple months ago i started thinking	and i had just learned learned how to use Lotus on a PC	1
agent:and tells me i need to get the money in or whatever|user:uh-huh|agent:um for the most part yeah i i i've got a real good banker uh personal bankers i mean if if i do if i am ever overdrawn she always calls and tells me	[laughter]	1
user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter] how long were you hanging around for|agent:uh	oh i don't know quite a while i was about to go to sleep [laughter]	0
user:waffling i don't know i|user:i'm kind of um [noise]|agent:what about yourself	i uh i don't really like the idea	0
user:um-hum|agent:deserves to be uh punished|agent:they uh the person that perpetuates the crime	yeah i uh	1
user:for acting out their sickness|user:um|user:if uh if you don't execute sick people	uh how by definition can you	1
user:to end that guy's life|user:i don't know i don't know whether you can you know morally take the power of the state|agent:well then	i i don't know i maybe that's a good reason to end his life	0
agent:and you know so they don't want their kid to go to school to find out that you know the kid really comes out of the cabbage patch [noise] but uh [laughter] but in our case uh we actually did it uh we took uh educational|user:[noise] yeah|agent:and those are the people you probably read about all the time in the news you know somebody's somebody's trying to you know get rid of evolution or something and	right	1
agent:you know they needed they just needed other kids to|agent:and it was just too much i mean it was just the kids were just|agent:got to the third grade point	yeah	1
user:[laughter]|agent:in uh the home schoolers associations there that just they were just blatant cheaters [laughter-and] [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] if their kid didn't do well yeah i mean they just filled it out themselves it was absurd you know|agent:i mean that testing can be really bogus you know because_1 we knew people	oh you mean you didn't have to take them_1 to like a central location a[nd]-	0
agent:but uh you know as far as the taxes go i mean i don't yeah yeah big deal nah|user:uh|user:right	you didn't worry about it	1
user:particular question in my mind is uh|user:all all substances the|user:you know a a general question is	it's very easy	1
user:when i was growing up uh|agent:um-hum|user:yes alcohol is uh one of the most and	i- i was	1
user:then as i grew older uh in|agent:um-hum|user:i kind of thought well this is a strict house and	fact one of the guys told me said you were kind of lucky	0
user:for the you do your thing and i'll do mine|agent:question|user:yeah that was a definite opening for the	um in my particular case i think that all of those	0
user:[noise] from little or nothing to to extreme very quickly|user:and if they have to spot the occasional user in the process and and when i say extreme i mean they can you can go from|user:the drug testing in my mind is is really to spot the extreme user	in this game i've been told	1
user:uh and i you know|agent:that doesn't effect their job performance|agent:yeah but you know i[t]- it i i think there's a broader issue there is does a company have a right to know something about a person	that doesn't effect your job performance i think as a as a real tough uh	1
user:and|user:that i think it does effect performance and|user:uh the problem is	you can go from a from a	1
agent:uh yes and no uh and my f[our]- uh three almost four year old is been in a preschool|agent:[noise]|user:[laughter] are they are they in any sort of child care	um-hum	0
user:um-hum|agent:[noise] uh younger kids uh early teens|agent:it's not that we don't trust but we just don't feel comfortable with uh	um-hum	1
agent:young families and|agent:has a lot of uh|agent:uh you know parents that that watch and neighbors she lives in a neighborhood that	um-hum	1
user:and i d[id]- i did that everyday|user:two boys that lived uh right next door to me they uh|user:my job pretty much my junior year in high school was sitting uh for	until uh their mother got home	1
user:right|agent:choosing not to to have her on a regular basis making a conscious decision and|agent:we ended up uh	um-hum	1
user:um-hum yeah my my father's girlfriend um|agent:different attitude towards child rearing|agent:uh different	she's she's a lawyer and so she works you know everyday nine to five and uh she keeps really long hours at the office and uh	0
user:uh at least offer to get involved with them in in|user:United States space program to|user:for the uh	send up some sort of a relief or supplies or something and	1
agent:right|user:it can do in any given year or period of years|user:certain logic could be [laughter-applied] to figure out how much spending	but i'd like to see you hear talk about this uh	1
agent:a lot more to be learned from it [laughter]|user:oh really|agent:n[ow]- now that's only one side of the story you know i'm sure if you ask someone from McDonald Douglas they would tell you there's	i would think so i'd certainly think so and then you have the unfortunate mix between military politics and scientific exploration that	0
agent:um-hum|user:probably yields as much information as as having somebody actually up there|user:yeah i agree i think that's definitely been worth while and like you said it's very cost effective and	although i sure wouldn't mind being the guy that's actually up there [laughter]	0
user:or i i think California had a uh|agent:so so four five years ago you had someone|user:i think that was the case	i- i [noise] i think she it was a female uh judge i think she was like the	1
user:like y[ou]- you i think you should have one appeal|user:um|user:certain crimes um i think they ought to	in one year you know to get it get it in if you don't get it done	0
user:yeah|agent:they're getting people through but does it still cost a lot of money to do all this|user:um-hum	yeah i think in i'm not sure what the average here in Georgia but i think it's like	0
agent:that's right|user:uh you know you just get him out of society [laughter] it's it's really no i don't really see any difference i mean|agent:[laughter]	a lot of people can argue you know oh human life you know well	0
agent:yeah i always thought [vocalized-noise] for an interesting idea would be to i don't now let the victims decide what happens to the guy|user:you know there's a l[ot]- plenty of them_1 out there you know|user:you know just course it it probably have to be pretty bad crimes i would think but	yeah	1
user:[laughter]|agent:yeah i mean we we have so many things on our ballots here in California to increase the jail size and it's just so much crime that's going on now|user:[laughter] i think we can spend the money you know better elsewhere	yeah	1
agent:um-hum|user:uh sort of a bonding experience in a sense for people in the country and the you know people of of uh sort of all different uh|user:um i have sort of mixed feelings about the whole thing i mean i think it would sort of be	you know socioeconomic racial uh you know	0
user:uh and also you know and still still manage it well i think they might be tempted for example to|user:um for everyone in the country sort of|user:worthwhile work	to not spend	0
agent:for you know a big organization like that that a lot of people go off and do the kind of coming of age thing as well|user:hm|agent:[noise] items that have been contracted out and paid for and th[at]- that in the end hadn't been built to specifications all kinds of stuff like that that was really disturbing	yeah and th[e]- part of the problem i mean e[ven]- even i think probably a little bit of the problem with the military is that you know people only stay for a few years a lot of the people	0
agent:all kinds of people working in they were getting paid but it was a uh you know building highways and stuff like that|agent:better memory of things like the uh the New Deal and all the things that went on then when Roosevelt had uh|agent:yeah i wish our generation had	yeah i	1
user:i've got a Ford Ranger that i drive and uh|user:yeah i think they have that tendency|agent:passed its tenth birth date but	i just had it uh oil oil change and lube done to it but	0
agent:um-hum|user:i don't like Ford a[t]- at all the company itself|user:but	because i did have a few problems and they've been utterly non responsive	0
agent:two and a half okay so if you live in Orlando and you go to Gainesville for repairs you must be an [vocalized-noise]|user:two two and a half|agent:no no no no Gainesville i know Or[lando]- Orlando aren't they about an hour and a half drive	a two and a half	1
agent:yeah|user:like new new transmission [laughter-things] [laughter-like] [laughter-that]|agent:yeah	i was really upset because_1 i was a an undergrad college student at the time and not making a whole lot of money [vocalized-noise]	1
agent:no um my wife doesn't work so we were just uh planning on trying to use that as a as a break in our activity and to give her a little more free time|agent:uh|user:did you u[tilize]- utilize that full-time while you were working	um-hum	1
user:and the reality is that we'll probably have to have a child|agent:right|user:and do you put chil[d]- child in day care some[where]- along that lines	in day care	1
user:it's probably one of the few programs that i've seen|user:it's used specifically and only for day care|agent:right	uh that accomplished that	1
user:you know most people i know who have had to make that decision|agent:day care and [laughter-i] [laughter-just] [laughter-tell] [laughter-her] [laughter-that] you know it's just it's not a matter of choice for most people we're fortunate we we have a choice|agent:to uh	the spouse usually the the mother in situations that i can think of	0
user:but i[t]- uh unfortunately it is a reality you just can't get by without|agent:yeah|user:as she dreads that date too i imagine	well very few people can get by without two incomes	1
agent:well i must admit that Utah has the best snow on earth|user:yeah well out here in the west you've got some nice places to go skiing|user:oh you go skiing eh	[laughter]	1
user:yeah i used to i used to regularly run and then about a year and a half ago i had some back problems|agent:yeah|user:so you like regularly do volleyball	and i haven't been able to get out and run and i have really noticed it in a year and a half i've gone from being fit to being	0
user:no i've never had problems with my knees at all|agent:great|user:no	um	1
agent:and just to move while running you've got to move your legs every single step|agent:well but you know like say riding a bike where if you go really slow it's pretty much coasting you're not even doing anything|agent:well even just walking	hm	1
agent:i can|user:does this extend out from like high school or something like that|agent:yeah i'm looking forward to that it's	athletics or anything that you used to do in high school	1
agent:uh it's a perfect thing uh for blackmail for people with high security clearances and so i've kind of over the twenty year period of time i've gotten kind of accustomed [laughter-to] [laughter-it]|agent:uh and of course addictive|agent:drug use is illegal	that's right	0
agent:[laughter-right] [laughter-especially] right you don't want to get caught|agent:[noise]|user:yeah there is and i and i can see why you know e[specially]- especially if you do do e[specially]- especially if you use illegal drugs i can see why you wouldn't want it i[t]- to happen to you and	[laughter-yeah]	0
agent:it's one of those problems that [noise] it's really hard to come up with an answer to|user:it's accessible that's right|agent:it but yet if tha[t's]- that's in any kind of a computer database [laughter] somebody's going to get access to it that and uh real easy to abuse so	yeah	1
agent:okay|user:i'll start|agent:[noise]	um	1
agent:um-hum|user:y[ou]- you get into this to impose your will upon others|user:[laughter-okay] is that	if you um	1
agent:um|user:imposing heavy taxes on transportations o[n]- on your means of transportation to uh build uh roads where they wanted them|user:um there was a time when the government wouldn't think of um	and i think tho[se]- those are the first of things that come to mind i think that um	1
agent:now what sort of uh what sort of which p[art]- which sort of trouble are you speaking of|user:because it will happen|agent:um-hum	well we're in a situation right now where um uh the comment uh not the first thing uh even in a situation right now where um	1
agent:television theft is death|user:um|agent:with your TV set and you feel that a fitting punishment for	um well there's an interesting issue there	0
user:how can i better say it|user:you know it's it's it's it's y[ou]- y[ou]- you it's it's a um|user:yeah one way or another um so when material objects are destroyed	you know when a material object is destroyed it is a portion of one's life that's consumed if you look at it that way	0
user:some kind of uh you know if if you um|user:okay you're moving|user:you're just moving stuff from one place to another	very strongly reinforce the p[articular]- e[nforce]- e[nforce]- enforce a particular um	1
user:well do you think that how many children do you think they should be allowed|user:well|agent:i don't think one pers[on]- one adult should have like twenty children to keep after	or should be in one facility at one time	1
user:really am i am|user:well i think that|agent:and so it saves the company money it's in the company's best interest	all for employers providing some [kype/type] type of child care	1
user:all the babies at the child care place that he went to|user:and um|user:his baby got sick in child care	all came down with an ear infection and that's	0

agent:keeping a focus on the goal|agent:just|agent:incentive but uh	um-hum um-hum	1
user:and you decided how much involvement that you got|user:and you could do as little or as much|user:and it could just be like an extracurricular club that you could become involved in	which	0
user:and and it one other thing you've got to really look at is uh depending on what age group you're going to involve you know be it high school or whatever you've got to have good adult mentors|user:um|user:right well that's true	you know	0

agent:right i|user:you better you better enjoy doing it or else it's not really worth it|user:that's right	the last one i did myself was i was i found that i was backing out of the garage	0
agent:um-hum|user:who would put a factory replacement part on and then charge me fifty bucks and hour to do the work|user:but i looked into getting that replaced and that was going to cost a fair amount of money because i would have to take it to the uh dealer	and so i figured well i can do that myself i i'll pick up the mirror myself which alone was more money than i wanted to spend on a just a stup[id]- little mirror	0
user:an[d]- oh no i'm sorry i had to have the window up to do what i was doing and i went to uh|user:and everything was fine i also have power windows and i had to have the window down to do what i was doing|agent:right	no it was down it was down i had to have the window down i went to uh put the window back up it was the middle of winter	0

agent:and i uh every year you hear somebody gets themselves killed by climbing under a car or under a jack|user:but that's not usually easy either|agent:right y[eah]-	um-hum	1
user:a s[ay]-|agent:um-hum|user:topics you're interested in because you really you can project say a you know uh	a student out of high school they might	0
user:right|agent:you they don't have any work experience or whatever maybe they've taken some classes in high school or something like that i think the advice you give i[s]- is excellent for that i think on the other hand there are there are st[udent]- there are students out there who know what they want to take|user:right	um-hum	1
agent:um-hum|user:the college hype okay|user:is that	and they send this they send these brochures and uh pamphlets and stuff to the the students and	0
agent:i i think that's a good idea and in general i think it's a good idea to to go to the school i mean once once you've narrowed down|agent:yeah i knew uh|agent:um-hum	right	1
agent:well so uh what uh word processing program do you use on that machine|agent:huh|user:but um basically my knowledge is limited [laughter]	uh WordPerfect	1
agent:oh well that's good|agent:[laughter] it just popped apart huh|user:no no it didn't it it needed it needed uh uh some glue to glue back the broken piece off but it works fine without it	so i left a note to my boss am i out of hot water now [noise]	1
agent:early fifties by Douglas Moore|agent:which was uh written in the|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:[noise]	[noise]	1
agent:i have yet to find anyone else that's ever been to these places|agent:little known places that|agent:to uh	yeah exactly i i'm from the midwest myself from Michigan	0
agent:the kids were just a nuisance|user:right|agent:they had kids	they they got in the way they cost money and they g[et]- they're	0
agent:[noise]|user:[laughter]|agent:[noise] people at work [laughter] uh [laughter]	not directly huh	1
user:you|agent:i i'm i'm beyond [laughter-this] and i'm acting just like they are|agent:[laughter] and i said wait a minute wait a minute	[laughter] you speak in simple sentences huh	1
agent:um-hum|user:no a[ttention]- no attention span|user:yeah yep	and then especially if it can't be solved in a half hour with ads in between you know	1
user:the accused right and if you um|agent:yeah the accused|user:the defendant	if you require the jury to be unanimous	0
agent:but as soon as they violate any other law and actually hurt somebody whether it's stealing money to get the Coke [vocalized-noise] loosing control and beating someone up that they should be treated the same way as someone who looses control and beats someone up without being under the influence of chemicals whose they can't use it as an excuse|agent:it's sort of like saying somebody should be able to do all the Coke they want|agent:that that means that the other crimes are no longer a valid point of contention	i certainly agree	1
agent:i think what we really need to do is concentrate more on reducing waste on assuring that government be efficient you know we need more programs where people get rewarded for money saving suggestions|user:yeah absolutely|agent:the federal government just grows and it seems like that the only way to restrain it is to restrain the increase in taxes if taxes are increased uh the government finds a way to spend it even you know given even that despite the fact that we have a budget deficit	yeah absolutely	1
agent:and i uh that may prevent it from getting worse but it doesn't solve it we haven't gotten our budget back into any better balance if it had not been for the savings and loan debacle at least it would have remained the same as a result it's gotten worse|agent:the Republican solution is to cut taxes|agent:well	um	0
user:[noise] although you know certainly our government is is very nice now i[t]- it probably doesn't hurt this sort of ultimate back up to have some so[me]- citizens to have guns if for some reason|user:think that uh hunting is a legitimate use for weapons and uh i also sort of believe that|user:but i also	something ever happened and	0
agent:and if if you are a a you know a legitimate hunter or you just need a handgun or something like that a two week or three week wait period is not going to make any difference|user:yeah i mean most|agent:and i and as far as hunting i'm su[re]- you know this is the same thing	yeah i agree completely	1
user:um|agent:that's true|agent:[noise]	and i'm sure they would certainly attempt to buy them on the black market so you'd need	0
user:yeah|user:um|agent:hum-um because they're always going to be able to get them_1	uh do you do you have any sort of	1
agent:oh my goodness|agent:my|user:you know robbers said you know i guess he was on a motorcycle and he had a his motorcycle helmet on which saved his life um because	they said you know we want your money you know we have gun or whatever so he was like okay here have my money you know i'll lie on the ground i'll do whatever you say [laughter-i'll] i'm not going to put up any fight whatsoever	0
agent:it really is|user:so it's kind of scary|user:but uh	living at um	0
agent:how do you keep up on current events|user:um|agent:who had just gotten out of the army and he told me he kept me up to [laughter-date] on what was going on	[noise] oh well i'm pretty much of a space cadet a zombie i really don't know much what's going on uh i guess m[ost]- mostly of what i get is from the news from the excuse me from the newspaper	1
agent:right right i guess i'd have to agree with you i hadn't really though of that but i certainly|user:can't really because they don't have the time|user:and doesn't really go much indepth	[noise]	1
agent:do you listen to the radio much|agent:um|agent:well yeah	nope	1
user:and uh|user:where they gi[ve]- every ten minutes they give traffic information|user:so i will tune in to news uh station	as a sort of a side effect i get news that way	1
user:and uh it's sort of a cloudy i would say broken skies mostly almos[t]- not quite overcast but|user:so the news the n[ews]- the current event news in California is that we had rain yesterday [laughter]|user:i call from a bunch of uh pay ph[one]- pay phones and whatnot	almost overcast	0
agent:yeah well i just wear blue gray and black blue gray and|user:like brown with um if you wear black with brown pants|user:okay	oh	1
user:better off than women are as far as their clothes go|user:that they're much|user:i think men look very nice i i think	because i think um	0
user:you know|user:in the work field if she's single she dresses|user:and she of course	i don't dress for um	0
user:if it's not|user:uh i th[ink]- i think even the men uh men are offended by that too|user:i don't know how they [laughter-feel] [laughter-about] [laughter-it] but it surely doesn't	you know if you're out in public and you're	1
user:there it's pretty much like that where i work|agent:there are no male secretaries so|user:yeah it's pretty	i was very offended by one of the young ladies who is a secretary and plus she's a mother	0
agent:knit something|agent:[vocalized-noise] uh weave thing not|user:yeah	something that you'd wear d[oing]- doing the garden maybe	0
user:didn't realize|user:but i think you have to take some action like that maybe she|agent:[laughter] hey	you know	1
agent:in square dancing and and round dancing and that's all all a[ll]- still on forty fives|agent:i uh have a little bit of an involvement in uh|user:um-hum	[laughter]	1
agent:sit around or stand around and talk or uh drink and talk or whatever and|agent:these parties they tend to want to|user:yeah	um-hum	1
agent:um-hum much of their music is sung in Zulu in the Zulu language so that's uh|user:yeah they're a very good group|agent:and um	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|agent:was able to listen to a few|agent:and i i	um-hum yeah	1
agent:sort of new age stuff|user:Celtic folk uh|agent:really that's interesting	well Still I Spin and Silly Wizard uh Fair Port Convention	0
agent:[vocalized-noise] yeah w[ell]- uh well you see um uh down here there is a big you know there's a huge Country Western influence um particularly what i like um the Blues|user:uh s[ound]- you sound like you probably are down in the uh|agent:i see i see	country and western belt [laughter-there]	1
agent:you know complement each other do do|agent:right [laughter] right right um i also like Jazz and um you know how do you think the two um|agent:right	well uh	0
agent:and write out a check for five thousand dollars and not know they're overdrawing their account|agent:to imagine that somebody's going to overwrite uh what what was the largest amount of checks|agent:it's hard to me	yeah	1
agent:yes|user:have you been to Washington|user:but	ha[ve]- have you watched those folks in action i mean i visited	0
user:yes that's true i i think they do things that make it easier for our|agent:use their influence in not always the most positive ways|agent:i think that's a greater problem because they're constantly trying to	elected representatives to ha[ve]- to live the good life	1
user:yeah the[y]-|agent:uh [laughter-no] [laughter-thanks]|user:well run for office [laughter]	i i what gets me is when they pass laws and they always manage to exempt themselves from them	1
agent:so uh you go first|agent:okay|user:okay i guess they're	okay	0
agent:uh-huh|user:explain up front that that might be a requirement but it sounded like it was kind of sprung on them by the uh firms they had contracts with|user:you know they didn't	uh	1
agent:um there are lots of factors that affect how i do my job i i don't personally take any drugs but you know that's one factor that could affect some[thing]- an employee's performance|user:uh-huh|agent:you know what's going on in my body to the degree that it affects how i am doing my job and	right	1
agent:and that's how i feel about it uh things drug testing for uh marijuana i guess can detect use uh or actually they can do tests with um with hair samples of hair and finger nails|agent:um|agent:or whatever	uh	1
agent:perfect marriage or something well then you know that doesn't make sense|agent:or that i require me to some how have a|agent:you know are they going to require that i stay married	uh-huh	1
user:that i think US ought to spend the same amount of money that we're spending but i think the states need to take|user:the way i see it in the in the last article i read was|user:the way um	advantage of it more than they are	1
user:well there's w[ell]- well we have we have our o[wn]- you know that we have i guess a fair share|agent:i wasn't aware that there was a very large uh gay community in Texas|user:and it's just not taking advantage of the money that's being provided	um	0
agent:yeah|user:and can[cer]- and cancer and such doesn't spread as readily|user:well also because it's so new	to other people as it does as AIDS does	1
agent:to be a cure|agent:uh i do want there|agent:uh i	um-hum	1
user:and we kee[p]- you know and all the new um you know things that we keep finding you know that you can be HIV positive for you know now what|user:you know and so i mean it's it's very difficult to put a cure on something that you keep expanding|agent:sure	have they bumped it up to eleven years now	1
agent:child care problems and needs|agent:well aware of|agent:[noise]	oh are you um what are you a nurse are you a doctor uh	0
user:uh i don't know i have i have my own opinions on the on the subject it's kind of|user:yeah i i it is i i um|user:uh	for me this particular question is is is uh reminiscent of uh	0
user:um|user:hey there you go|agent:doesn't matter if i agree or not oh [laughter]	i don't know i i tend to think that child care is kind of overused i think there's a	1
user:it's rough and i think that there's a|agent:yeah|user:if somebody would at least [vocalized-noise] i don't know it's	well there	0
user:and uh they|agent:yeah there's no way|user:and uh	[noise] you know	0
agent:it turns out that uh we are a non profit organization|agent:uh actually no um|user:so um how are the benefits set up are they set up like they are in the federal government or are they	uh-huh	1
agent:and the idea there is that if you go with one of their associated doctors they'll pay eighty percent if you go with a non associated doctor they pay seventy percent|user:um-hum|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:uh-huh|user:and uh it's a little bit less that way now the recession has even hurt a lot of the big law firms in this area|agent:um-hum	but um	0
agent:unanimous verdicts although that can certainly cause problems sometimes|agent:i do think that we need to have|agent:oh i think basically it works okay the uh	yeah def[inite]- definitely you want the benefit of the doubt and	0
user:so i don't quite like the idea of the in civil trials in sounds like in a lot places the jury comes up with what the award amount should be|agent:it's|agent:variation there it's not just did they do it or didn't they do it	i think you really want	0
user:on the same lines the uh punitive damage awards|user:and i also think ye[ah]-|agent:help anybody except the lawyers who'd get their cut of it their half	should really go more towards let's say the government and supporting the court system	0
user:and the other thing i guess that was in there was whether the|agent:the uh|user:yes yes [laughter]	you know the other thing i guess on the topic that i'd bring up is um	0
user:so i think that pretty much clearly leads me to my con[viction]- conviction that i i do not believe that uh|user:really believe that other people would have the right for someone to under go a blood test without their explicit consent|user:in that i don't	spot drug tests or required drug tests should be should be	0
agent:and they take your license on the assumption that you're guilty which makes sense|user:i[t]- it's a privilege to drive and there's certain things that go along with it but even then they don't force you to take any kind of test if you simply don't take the test then you just you know|user:and uh in the case of driving it's not a	[laughter-yeah]	1
agent:it's under those grounds that we don't have alcohol prohibition or tobacco prohibition|user:[noise]|agent:i'd say it's pretty much it's uh right to privacy the individual can do whatever they want as long as they don't negatively impact other individuals it is then that negative impact that should be looked at not the uh not the direct cause of it	right	1
user:uh redone the floors completely because_1 the carpet was destroyed|user:so we had to redo everything on the inside we've painted all the walls|user:-[a]bout two or three years ago and it was about to be repossessed and the people that lived in this house were real filthy they had animals and they smoked and it was just a real dirty house	and um our last big project was the hall bathroom	0
agent:and i went through more tools because_1 it um i was using a power screwdriver|agent:[noise]|user:[laughter]	uh-huh	1
agent:um i wiped out the bathroom i thought oh i can do this is a week and i got everything here i got all the tools and no sweat|user:[laughter]|agent:that one wasn't so bad as much as tiling the floor of the bathroom where	uh-huh	1
agent:the right tools make all the difference in the world|user:uh-huh|agent:not difficult difficultly uh not really difficult it's just	[laughter-ri[ght]-] do you spend a lot of money	0
agent:that when i flipped it on it started to rip the tiles off the floor|user:uh-huh|agent:so i went up to the store and i found the one that had the forty horsepower motor attached to the fan	oh dear	1
agent:uh obviously if they want to learn trade skills you wouldn't send them to an academic center and vice versa|user:uh-huh|agent:uh what range of colleges they should go to	uh-huh	1
agent:well|user:and and determine a goal some point uh before like the last moment [laughter]|agent:um-hum	and but you know you never know they always a lot of people go to college because they don't know what else is better to do	0
user:sometimes you might be able to get a scholarship or whatever have you so i wouldn't rule them out|user:you know you could always shoot for those places that don't ha[ve]- you know are [vocalized-noise] that might be considered out of your range but|user:um but people you know you want to try to match their needs as best they can and then if	on the first cut	0
user:and uh|user:i think there's things like student uh faculty ratios and|user:and uh	all that kind of stuff how well endowed the school is sometimes you that's important because	0
agent:[noise]|user:yeah they also tend not to be as well endowed and they also have|agent:and um	lots of other	0
user:a v[ery]-|user:his speaking i- i- i hear a|user:he does i- i- i from just	a strong tinge of integrity	1
agent:to implement this well a billion stacked against a hundred and eighty billion sounds like a good investment to me|agent:the boards right now for computer systems and other tracking methods to get rid of the fraud and everyone says well it's going to cost a billion dollars|agent:um apparently they have plenty of time	but are we what do you think are we talking about	1
user:um-hum|agent:um if uh you know we we say the president can be limited to two terms and we don't limit|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
user:do some wrangling over there to for the trade deficit and they send the send the top|user:well then you have you have President Bush going over to Japan to try to|agent:are they going to balance a trillion plus dollar budget	executive from GM	0
user:i me[an]- i agree with you to|user:you know i- i-|agent:out of business and away from business and out of everybody's hair	a certain extent but the problem is with democra[cy]- with you know our capitalistic government	0
agent:that's uh an interesting one for me to talk about since i have no children but i did run a child care facility for a while|agent:oh [laughter-okay] yeah the uh subject is child care and how to determine child care and|user:go ahead [laughter]	hm	1
agent:people the qualified people|agent:exactly and that was the most difficult thing of all to find the the right|user:uh depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children	and it's the most difficult thing of all for a parent	0
user:um and then of course to make up for that um the uh parents would have to work in their later years longer i[n]- in other words they probably would not work|user:and then [noise]|agent:um-hum	may not en[d]- may end up not working at all in the twenties	1
agent:oh|user:maintain if you just simply continue to exercise your mind [noise] [noise] so i think a person could work [noise] uh into the seventies eighties|user:easy to sustain	even nineties for that matter if they didn't have to do a lot of physical uh labor they could main[tain]- maintain uh	1
agent:[laughter]|user:yeah|agent:gets a little annoying	what kind of progressive stuff	1
agent:and i could uh go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money|user:oh yeah|agent:he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes	[laughter] uh but he picked the right songs and	0
user:[laughter]|agent:and feel that if if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time|agent:of people who are really into classical music	[laughter] yeah i can i can believe that what kind of things are you do you like in classical what's the	0
EMPTY	[noise] well i guess uh	1
agent:yeah|user:that was late fifties i believe so|agent:[noise] okay	and um	0
agent:uh when it comes to research i'm not sure i agree with that|agent:reason for commercial|agent:valid	well what would be what would be the reasons for prohibiting commercial research	1
agent:European technology why aren't see see space travel is a world issue it's not a US issue and and our our our kind of elitism attitude we had in the sixties about|agent:so why aren't we using the Japanese technology why aren't we using the|user:um-hum	well	1
agent:um-hum|user:throw a couple of billion dollars into it over the next twenty years|user:and you're three or four competitors and you're debating whether to um	but it's going to be a real long term uh	0

agent:oh well certainly the people that do volunteer to do all sorts of things aren't thinking cost effective|user:yeah i- i but i wonder about that the the mere fact that it isn't cost effective do you think that that i[f]- if it's not cost effective do you think that people are going to be enthused about it|user:well think of it ye[ah]-	well [laughter]	0
user:that's an awful lot to to bring into a program you got to have eight million jobs available you've got to have administrators for eight million jobs that would be tremendously expensive|user:but uh|user:uh kids c[ollege]- uh turning eighteen every year i think it's about that might be a little bit lower now	not you know not to forget the cost of putting all of those kids in	0
agent:and uh they had a whole bunch of people go out west and dig ditches and plant trees and|user:right|agent:well they did this in uh the depression they invented what the CCC	that's true but but i think that was different uh in at least three respects first of all	0

user:is to|user:you know what might very well do uh cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that|user:well you know uh talking about the lawyers	set the fees for cases it's kind of like do it do it in the similar vein similar like uh VCR or television repair	0
user:yeah|user:oh yeah|agent:heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney and here's this bum that didn't have a job and he's got a attorney that you and i could never afford	that's true yeah	1
user:which is|user:but recently we started a program i think is getting encourages a lot more participation|user:and basically only the ecologically minded would go to such pa[ins]- places because it's it's a drive out of your way to take things to these	uh you have to now pay for each	0
user:bin or recyclable uh container they|user:so there's the motivation basically your regular garbage you have to pay to get picked up and recyclable stuff if you put it in a recyclable|user:then they'll pick that up for free	they give you one of these	0
agent:so|agent:i don't want to pay the buck and a half and i'll throw it in the garbage|agent:somehow it seems to me like people will just say	so like somebody messed up	1
user:[noise]	okay so i guess it starts recording now	1
agent:really|user:i don't really know they they started after we moved down here and so i i'm not really familiar i just know that|agent:for cans even i've seen that i[n]-	and my in-laws up in up in Oklahoma that's how they do you know they pick it up but i don't know if they get a	0

user:our|user:uh no we're not being tested for drugs at all uh|agent:how about_1 you	policies and procedures manual uh the furthest it goes about drugs is in the	0
agent:you know territory and everything but|agent:their|agent:adhering to their drug policy because_1 they're on their	huh	1
agent:you know they're they should be able to make it as a condition of employment in some sense and you know it's like you're i mean employments are contractual by nature anyway|agent:i don't know i'm ambivalent about the whole thing i you know i have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it's like if|agent:and	um-hum	1
agent:but i think it's a deterrent|agent:possibility or a possibility of capital punishment it uh it may be worth it|agent:was going to kill somebody thought otherwise because of the uh	yeah i think so too	0
agent:but is that is that a capital crime|agent:i never thought about that|user:i don't know	don't know	1
agent:electrocutions up in Sing Sing up in New York upstate New York and then uh they did away with like you said Supreme Court outlawed it and then it came back on a state by state basis|agent:i know when i was growing up there was uh there were a lot of uh|agent:and uh	yeah	1

agent:to guess wrong once in a while|agent:is it all right|agent:what is uh	um yeah yeah	0
user:uh i don't know you know it's gotten to the point where|user:if they executed anybody on it recently i don't think so|user:[laughter] well Evan uh i suppose they do have the death penalty down here i don't know if um	something like that if i see it in the paper or hear about it it's just kind of like in one ear and out the other	0
user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter]|user:not that we need more or anything like that	yeah that was a bizarre case	0
user:Jim Bakker getting forty five years|user:i guess occasionally there's some about harsh stuff one harsh sentence that i kind of liked was uh|user:they're often does seem to be backlash against light things	that's that seemed like justice but it seems they reevaluated his sentence or resentenced him or something like that i don't know if they changed it	1
user:when it comes our turn to retire|user:for instance like Social Security tax or Soc[ial]- uh i mean that's that's tax we're paying money and and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that|user:are we getting a reasonable return on on investment	the money will be there for us	1
agent:well yeah i'm not exactly sure uh about polio in particular i know we have a polio vaccine which will prevent somebody from getting polio i'm not sure if we know what to do|user:and and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down and and they just haven't yet|user:i may be wrong but i believe that the cure for polio is already founded but but supposedly once you have an office in DC or you know	uh-huh	1
agent:[noise] there's always going to be a dispute|agent:[laughter] right and just to get rid of the unimportant things and whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment|user:yeah	uh-huh	1
user:i mean it's it's tough i mean there's there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of|user:it's uh|user:[laughter]	tough financial situations i guess you can	0
user:yeah i find myself uh listening to a lot of uh|agent:folk music|user:uh mostly folk music	uh either old timer or New England uh dance bands as well as uh just	1
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:at least to me it's uh sounds like it's only sounds good at a high volumes and i don't like listening at high volumes	but uh	0
agent:yeah yeah that's more even more commercialized form of country music|user:Hollywood sound type|user:uh	yeah	1
agent:as far as yeah i don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless i've heard it|agent:will buy something new that i haven't heard and i listen to it that way but|user:yeah	yeah see that's one thing i like about the uh some of the folk music scenes you know there's a couple of nice uh small coffee houses up in New Jersey	0
agent:i've i've got three kids who collect football cards|user:yeah|agent:uh yeah they had[n't]- i don't think they really traded anybody that i know of yet um	yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:but uh he's one of the taller ones|user:but	uh	1
user:and they've done that every season every year|agent:um-hum|user:they get overconfident in the second half they get ahead in the first half and the second half they just kind of blow it you know	for a while [laughter]	1
agent:oh [laughter-r[eally]-] [laughter-that's] [laughter-pretty] [laughter-good]|user:reserved for me|agent:really [laughter]	[laughter]	1
user:oh yeah that's kind of|agent:you know they don't do the instant replay and then on the other things you know a touchdown pass or something like that you know they always get out the instant replay and call backs|agent:they just don't	yeah that's just like a couple of them_1 instant replays they did they were over their two minute limit	0
user:cases of you know|user:or a car theft you know it things of that nature very few uh you you assaults although on the college campuses uh there are uh|user:what's more likely to occur is uh robbery of uh you know knocking over a a small store	like people getting machine from a from an automated teller and you know somebody trying to to device a scam for for uh	0
user:yeah but uh i guess|agent:[laughter-there] [laughter-is] [laughter-a] [laughter-crime]|user:now there's a crime for you [laughter]	most of the things that happen around here are are pretty uh innocuous although	0
agent:lucrative to take chances like that you know even though it it does exist|agent:so you really not making a sizeable profit so it's not really|user:yeah	you know i- i just to diverge a little bit uh i live in an apartment right now i'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh	0
user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	well	1
agent:you know know the ins and outs of the system better|agent:um|agent:judges	i agree i think that's very true	0
agent:that would take a major constitutional change here [laughter]|agent:but i guess uh|agent:um	definitely would but i see where they would be experts	1
agent:right [laughter] that's true too you know how does how does that work|user:that's kind of goes like our Supreme Court [laughter-in] [laughter-a] [laughter-way]|user:it does but	[laughter]	1
agent:[vocalized-noise] another interesting thing is you know m[ost]- m[ost]- most people try and get out of jury duty right|user:yeah|agent:right that's that's a really interesting issue too and um you know most people	oh definitely	1
user:hum until they|agent:um that that helps f[or]- for that planning|agent:uh medical and uh child care uh all together so	you wouldn't happen to work for Liberty Mutual would you	1
agent:um-hum [noise]|user:uh for my wife and i|user:the first year that actually the first month that i've actually instituted a budget	for the previous nine years or so we've just pretty much	0
user:but like i said|user:uh so far it's working out pretty well you know we're keeping an eye on what we spend each week|user:you know with all the monthly bills and uh	being one of the first months we really won't know for a few more months down the road how well we're doing	0
user:ah|agent:fantasizing about can't do it right now our situation is that we're a two car family|agent:uh	uh-huh	1
agent:how about_1 you|agent:something a little seating room|user:uh-huh	well i think the next car we get will probably be a [noise] well i- i like	0
user:something that'll carry it around safely i guess is best best way to describe it|agent:sure|user:you know i'm not looking for one with a great big engine uh	right now we've got a V-6 in it and that seems to be just fine i know they s[aid]- they're coming out with some V-8s now and i think that's probably	0
agent:[laughter] actually uh|user:you know it's a two wheel drive truck and i figure if it's so bad that i need a four wheel drive i probably ought to be home anyway|user:uh not really um	[laughter]	1
user:one of my sons has a a Plymouth uh|user:um-hum|agent:flip them_1 around so we've been able to do some real creative uh load hauling when called upon	van	0
agent:a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra|agent:uh [noise] i'd be satisfied with a|user:uh what about uh all wheel drive is that something that you'd be interested in or is that a not an issue	um-hum	1
user:i wonder if um|user:yeah i i|agent:you know ones that really add up after a while i guess you know from -[in]su[rance]- far as insurance money and stuff like that insurance costs you know everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually	if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because	0
agent:[noise]|user:have you been|user:what kind what kind have you been uh	the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything	1
agent:a pretty good thing|agent:well for for a lot of the kind of premeditated murders i think the death penalty is|user:or something like that	i agree with that	1
user:but|agent:right|user:perfect you know you you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect	i think you have to accept some of the errors	0
user:yeah generally the crimes of passion and things like that|agent:you know they're thinking about it they know they're going to get the chair if they get caught|agent:i g[uess]- y[ou]- y[ou]- you might be able to uh stop people	um are not premeditated	0
agent:that's right they didn't have any time doing it the first time|user:yes they they would have no problems doing it again|agent:yeah they could p[robably]- probably do it again	um-hum	0
user:most of the time|user:i don't think it deters anybody because [noise]|user:uh it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime but i don't think that it really actually does that	crimes are uh are committed with[out]- without any thought to the consequences and they don't think that uh stop and think and say well maybe i shouldn't do this uh because uh	0
user:right|agent:well for some things i think for serial murderer it is warranted|agent:or	um-hum	1
user:it's a difficult uh problem isn't it to|user:i don't know that it's always effective [laughter] but i guess we uh we're kind of stuck with it it's|user:i tend to agree with you that uh we should have it [noise] i just	determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime	1
agent:i think in ce[rtain]- and it just would depend upon the circumstances and and the|user:i know they put uh put them in jail sometimes i guess uh|agent:i don't know because	um-hum	1
user:and i know that uh if somebody had done something to my family|user:to uh if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to uh execute that person|user:so if somebody killed somebody in your family [noise] then you had the right	i would feel that i had the right to to get revenge on them and uh [noise] but i i don't think that's done much anywhere [laughter]	0
user:huh|user:uh-huh right because they are a danger to everybody else|agent:i think they should be eliminated from society	that's interesting	1
user:wow|user:really|agent:i almost never watch TV news [laughter] i get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:Dallas Morning News which is the big paper in Dallas|agent:yeah we have a lo[cal]- well we have uh|user:so you have a paper or something or	um-hum	1
agent:i guess they closed down about three months ago|agent:oh when did it happen|user:no not how i mean when did it when did they [vocalized-noise] yeah	oh really	1
user:San Fernando Valley|user:in fact i think there still is the uh the Daily News which runs out of the|agent:[noise]	and um	0
user:but uh a[nd]- and occasionally i- i pick up like Time magazine or something i think uh if they've got an interesting lead story but|user:uh news rack right around the corner from where i live which means that they're they're expanding i guess|user:there's a daily new	you know it's i- i don't have time	1
agent:[laughter]|user:it was it was a big discovery when when the Times when the Times found out there was a place called Orange County [laughter]|user:i uh	[laughter] i mean [laughter] the way they i mean the way they've been handling it before they practically they practically acted like their reporters needed shots to go south of the LA county border [laughter]	1
user:uh we should be emphasizing uh things like more like education|user:i think that uh|agent:um-hum	and less on on programs which are permanent black holes which will never	1
agent:like a warehouse almost|user:you h[ad]- they had no sense of ownership no sense of responsibility|user:their environment i mean uh uh p[rojects]- projects were the most idiotic concept in the world	i[t]- well it was like it's just a place for you to stay	0
agent:refurbish it and|user:right|agent:government aid	and it was all legal	1
user:you very seldom a[ble]- a[ble]- a[ble]- able|agent:um-hum [noise]|user:we don't have enough balls to actually make these programs work uh we[ll]- part part of the symp[tom]- symptom of a democratic s[ystem]- system is that it it kind of uh freezes itself up	to do anything that's strong on either side whether it be left or right	0
agent:i can wear casual dress or casual pants|agent:um|agent:and so basically i wear	oh okay	1
user:a nursing uniform|agent:um-hum|user:yeah i have i wear a uniform	so i don't really have much choice	1
user:and|agent:yeah|user:will last me a long time until i have to start working more days	there's not much of a selection	0
user:yeah definitely|agent:i mean sometimes i think it's cheaper to stay home than because_1 at home i just wear like joggers or Levi's or you know whatever comfortable [laughter-and]|user:oh okay	uh-huh that sounds good	0
agent:like an office manager like|user:one of those titles|user:whatever it	uh sort of [noise]	0
user:exactly [laughter]|agent:because_1 i've seen a lot of people that always look really hot but i'd n[ever]- i could never make it through a day [laughter-wearing] [laughter-what] [laughter-they're] [laughter-wearing] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] i was like|user:yeah she's really good at doing that [laughter]	um-hum	1
agent:well and quality because_1 i don't know i try to f[ind]- find things that|agent:yeah|user:yeah but you're right i think those things tend to be more expensive	yeah	1
EMPTY	[noise]	1
user:it's not as a personal uh the news isn't as personal|agent:um-hum|user:or it's not happening in your backyard so it's it's more of a	in what we receive domestically than than what's on the shortwave it's BBC is um	1
user:oh|agent:[noise]|user:to um	to really	0
user:yeah i- i think people are people have that opinion they they wanna sit down in front of the TV and um or|agent:and opinions spoon fed to them|agent:the not just the facts but also the conclusions	at a read a magazine or USA Today and read in four paragraphs	1
user:um they|user:good teachers good curriculum|user:i'm happy with their school it's great	learn a lot they have no problems	0
user:you know i'm happy with what they're in so|user:but|user:um	go ahead [laughter]	1
user:yeah|agent:of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away [laughter] to get better schools so you know it it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of|agent:to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of	[laughter-right] [laughter]	1
agent:[laughter]|user:[noise] oh [noise] why are [laughter-you] [laughter] you j[ust]- they just don't i mean i mean i'm i'm up there at my kid's school i know what they're learning and if they're up i call and find out you know is she having problems does she need help with anything no she's doing fine okay|agent:why is that	you know um	0
agent:you know which is really nice and|agent:which has been|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:right like|user:yeah|agent:but uh [laughter] they uh most of the time [vocalized-noise] pretty careful shopping anyway i get pretty good stuff i think that uh aside from the fact all markets being internationalized and if you want to buy [laughter-American] it takes real extra work to find and it's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the US [laughter]	exactly i was reading	1
user:just like|user:essentially i h[aven't]- i don't see much of a trend i mean|user:and uh	every other time that you look at it the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there there's nothing wrong with them	0
agent:is about the only one that's going it's right forcing IBM and the rest of the DOS world to follow along|agent:and the hardware well i mean all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity and the Macintosh|user:i don't know	yeah	1

agent:former Soviet Union|agent:right i mean yeah first of all i think that we have to agree that|user:[noise] so it's kind of an obsolete [laughter-question] at this point since there isn't a Soviet Union anymore but	for former right right w[e]- we can say the the the the soon to be former uh Commonwealth of Independent States instead	1
agent:[noise]|user:right i- i think actually you know the the except for the fact that we happen to be due west of them and we got a fallout cloud i don't think|agent:i- i think there's still a lot of threats there i'm not sure if you can once again like you said it's kind of obsolete is it the Soviet Union that's threatening us though	the the the probability that we're gonna be involved in the first strike or anything is fair[ly]- is fairly high	0
agent:systems i mean what what's the chance for an accident in that case also on top of the fallout factor|agent:uh you know some very different etiologies in there also it if they were to use them there what would all of our audit detection and what not [laughter-type]|user:yeah	right and and the of course the other thing is you've got them all arguing over their nuclear subs and	0

user:uh i didn't have to worry|user:the nice thing i liked about foot racing was that uh for me it was pretty much non competitive|user:uh-huh	so much about being a part of a team or anything and so i could just compete against myself or the clock or the next guy ahead of me	0
agent:right|user:which slowly creeps up as you get less and less fit|agent:uh-huh	and uh i haven't weighed myself in a good while	0

agent:oh i see|user:that's [laughter-factored] into the price already and i don't i'm not i don't think it's worth the added price you pay|agent:oh you didn't	i mean if you're going for like	0

agent:you know it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins|user:uh-huh|agent:well here they and uh live in an apartment complex and they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters so a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because	i i know a lot i think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling	0
user:yeah [noise] no it it didn't it it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling|agent:the stores that sell you know sodas and stuff because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything|agent:more work for the uh	bottles and cans	0
user:yeah that's a good idea|agent:some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate|agent:instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get	yeah	1
user:yeah they they just matter of fact that that reminded me of an article i saw in the pa[per]- the local schools|agent:trash|agent:annual [laughter]	you could send your phone book to your uh to with your kid to school	0

agent:you know it's all it's all money now even college is all|agent:yeah it's high dollar|agent:but	right	1

user:uh views that are more conservative just don't get adequately represented in the mainstream media that's been documented by a number of studies but on capital punishment look that's an exception|user:they ta[ke]- the the the the the average person in the media is far more liberal than the average person in the rest of the country and so|user:uh	[laughter-i'm] [laughter-not] conservative on that i'm sort of middle of the road i- i lean against capital punishment but	0
user:if you find out you put somebody in jail wrongly you can just let them_1 out if you find out that you you killed somebody wrongly there's nothing you can do to bring them back to life so|user:[noise] yeah well i'm i mean i- i- i agree i think that that the problem with capital punishment is that it's irrevocable|user:um-hum	so that's definitely a problem and um	0
user:possible improvements on uh|user:uh discussion topic in terms of|user:actually to tell you the truth i think uh jury selection is a uh prime	uh finding of	0
user:i suppose an elitist might say well you really want someone who's well educated to be able to|user:uh everyone gets involved in uh the jury process and|user:but typically you know basi[cally]- uh typically	to	0
agent:to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be|agent:as to the death penalty or whatever but i think that it should be up to the judge and the uh lawyers|agent:and many times i've seen on trials they have on TV the jury -[w]ill make a recommendation as to leniency or	hm	1
user:um-hum|agent:i don't i don't know that they always have because i never sat all the way through a jury trial they get too boring|user:um-hum	so you['re]- what you're saying is if if this is the second offense then you execute them_1	1

agent:even though you know the revenue stream went to another state i don't i don't think that that's my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer|agent:and i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed|agent:i can't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area so i go outside the area for that	i i'll agree it it's not your responsibility but	1
agent:Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania|agent:it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh i bought this out of state i need [noise] to|agent:then i don't argue with it because	which is exactly what businesses do at the present	1
user:um|user:from from say Utah|user:purchasing things mail order if i if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see these this great deal on forty eighty six motherboards uh	i- i might	0

agent:that's true|user:they suffer|user:somebody is depending on you you've got to do something for them or or they uh	so it adds a dimension that that uh you're kind of in control and that's	0
agent:[laughter] i think it's i think if they put it into force more often they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got|agent:uh i don't think they should abolish it|agent:okay	but not for petty theft	1
user:the end game value|user:if you put a value on each person what you want to do is to maximize|user:uh one of the things i was thinking about is uh you know from society's point of view	so if you have someone that that destroys that value	1
user:another way you could do it is weight this value by uh the value to society of the people|agent:okay|user:uh in order to justify taking his life	uh which is pretty uh	0
user:small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him|user:uh but if he only uh integrated you know integrated income over the ex[pected]- expected remainder of his life is um|user:who knows eight hundred thousand dollars	of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it's more easy it's easier to uh	0

agent:uh-huh|user:of instruction in the major subjects|user:of uh	uh	0
user:and um [noise] a number of educational theorists uh pre[dominately]- predominately conservative or they're called conservative because they think this i suppose|user:they'll rank themselves much higher than will for example Korean students who do much better at math|user:these are these are scores on standardized tests and yet if you uh give American students the question i am good at math	say that the problem is that we've gotten away too much from teaching the kids the material	0
agent:their thirties who teach school twenties and thirties|user:um-hum|user:um-hum	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:um i don't even have to i don't have to ask anybody i just go do it|user:um-hum|agent:but i'm sure i'm sure that it it's like uh i work at AT&T and now i- i if i want to spend four hundred dollars	hum	1
user:yeah|agent:but no no money for supplies|user:um-hum	yeah well i think that that one way to solve the problem i mean i- i- you know if anything doesn't work right introduce competition	1
user:the Wasatch front along the|user:up along|user:yeah definitely here in Utah	western side of the of these Rocky Mountains here where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo and	0

user:i don't know i think part of the things is maybe a value added tax like what they have in Europe i mean|user:oh still i mean we have the right to do it we don't do it that's the whole problem we don't exercise those rights|user:[vocalized-noise]	um	1
agent:[vocalized-noise] the numbers were too large for me|user:yeah|agent:that i can't even comprehend	well think about the wars the nuclear situation and all that	0

user:it's kind of|user:uh|user:uh accidents	uh	0
agent:um i personally feel that if someone came into my house i'd be too much of a nervous wreck to shoot them accurately and i wouldn't want to hit my kids in case they were wandering around so i really have no|agent:i keep it locked i keep the bullets somewhere else|agent:i took a uh National Rifle Association course on how to uh handle one	hm	1

user:i|user:[noise] the|agent:hits those proverbial heart strings	i can respond to that a little bit by	1
user:but this was in|agent:so i've kind of gone around and done it number of places|agent:and some out in Montana Colorado	years past or yeah	1
agent:i've never deemed that as a threat to myself but|agent:cooperative all the way around so|agent:um	yeah	1
user:[noise] yeah|agent:um-hum|user:yeah i- i think with the c[ase]- like in the case of the canyon you see more from the rim than you would ever c[amping]- camping down [laughter-inside] [laughter-of] [laughter-it]	are there mountains in Wisconsin for you to	0

agent:[noise]|user:so i've let's see s[o]-|user:[laughter] on a scale i guess i'm about a nine and a half	ten means what	1
agent:hm|user:but anyway|agent:right	i uh	1
user:uh|user:it can be kind of scary the idea of just everybody wandering around with uh|user:well it's i know it can be uh	you know absolute no limits or anything like that	0
user:he should of have lived in in uh|user:some some of my friends were saying you know that's another argument for gun control i said oh yeah he should have lived in in uh|user:one of the	Ireland	0
user:that|user:with uh this topic is that|user:how do i say this the uh the thing that i have noticed	i know some very intelligent people and i- i say well here's a little brochure why don't you read this and see what it says i don't want to read that	0
user:should have a lot of crime|user:Virginia should have a lot of them_1|user:now my earlier statement about if if they caused crime then	uh	0
user:and my feeling if you go back to England|user:and|user:bu[t]- but it's the uh it's the nature	uh England is one of those places where they have relatively low rates	0
agent:i get the point yes i've had a lawn before [laughter]|user:uh uh if you if you've ever had a lawn|agent:[laughter] w[hat]- okay	if you've ever had a lawn uh and somebody says uh wait till the place is full of dandelions and then go try and and pull the heads off as fast as you can	0
agent:yeah he upsets people up here um every time he does it i don't what it is down in Florida these days|user:[laughter] gets sort of repetitious|agent:and every year he vetos it [laughter] and upsets people	it's legal down here um	0
agent:um Art Shawcross up in Rochester killed nineteen prostitutes up here|agent:yeah they fill the court th[ere]- the jails up and suddenly let them_1 go and they're back on the street we had this murder up here|user:yeah there's always those loopholes	ooh	1
user:in terms of if you're absolutely sure i mean uh uh|user:and yeah it drags on for about forever you know i guess i'm about your your opinion of it i have nothing against it philosophically|user:um well i can i can vouch for the fact that the uh the appeals will go through and go through and go through	i- i would feel that you better make sure it's one of those cases that	0
user:that capital pun[ishment]- punishment as a deterrent is a is a big deal|user:that it really doesn't [laughter-save] [laughter-you] any money if it's a money thing and as a deterrent thing i don't really think uh personally i don't feel|user:that uh	i don't think that really works that much	1
user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:the like [noise]|user:yeah	oh down here it's not all peaceful either [laughter-though] i don't if you've been following any of this stuff course we had the big snafu right now with the the Mets thing but there have been	0
agent:because of it i just don't feel like they're they're getting enough out of it you know for|agent:my child now is in public school and we're getting ready to put her into a private school|agent:um i think that they	academic	1
agent:because of that you know because of that but the property taxes that you have on your home depending on what area you are you know like they're higher in certain areas than they are in other areas you know but uh|agent:that goes towards uh the school systems|user:uh-huh	sure	1
agent:yeah|user:yeah i think the most important thing that a public school can do to|user:but you	help the problem is	0
agent:no really exactly yeah to stay home is like oh yeah [laughter]|user:yeah well maybe they'll make them_1 stay home for a day but that's no [laughter-torture] [laughter-for] [laughter-a] [laughter-kid]|user:well you know	[laughter]	1
user:but i- i think the the public school it's not that the teachers are inferior or that the materials are inferior i think what's going on is that|agent:right right i know i|user:dupe me [laughter-i] [laughter-think]	the teachers have to be backed up when the kids don't do what they're supposed to do	0
agent:um-hum|user:in terms of uh the national elections the election later this year since Perot is from Dallas and if he gets on the|agent:um-hum	uh ballot i think there w[e]- that we will have the larger percentage of voter turnout than usual	1
agent:arena of politics i don't even see|agent:uh|user:isn't	yeah	1
user:both my wife and i uh|user:have to say i really don't have a budget|user:well i	grew up in uh	0
agent:yes|user:i would say rather pathological [laughter]|user:although we just moved to California and uh the cost of living here in California is um	uh housing prices are	0
user:um|agent:[laughter]|user:uh and one way you know that is that only God can afford it [laughter]	so	1
user:and uh i noted at that point that i was|agent:um-hum|user:oh six hundred and ten dollars a month or something like that	you know if that's what my salary was that i drew then i would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year	0
agent:uh well we're we have one on the way um my wife and then we're we're having one on the way in uh|user:uh how big is your family|agent:yeah	i see	1
EMPTY	[noise] okay	0
user:they treat them they treat them just|agent:yeah um-hum yeah the|user:the way they the way the uh nurses and the nurses aids and [vocalized-noise] they treat them	utterly horrible	0
user:they hate|user:uh in the nursing home worked off and on for years in nursing home and|user:worked	old people	1
user:you know i feel like that|user:one thing you really must do|user:you know my uh	go to a nursing home drop in at times that you don't normally drop in	1
agent:and we were talking about this because his father is getting to the age where they're going to have to decide what to do and|agent:you know that brings up a good point i've got a friend of mine up here|agent:yeah you know it really is	uh-huh	1
agent:and charge the family member who doesn't cooperate just say basically look|agent:keep the f[ather]- keep the father or mother for a longer time|agent:keep him	[vocalized-noise]	1
user:um-hum yeah i sort of believe the same way i think i'm|agent:um background checks before they just hand a gun over to any old person|agent:something in that order i think that it's important that there be some check	i'm probably considered more of a conservative but i still think that uh	1
user:but uh i- i guess the uh NRA they kind of look at it as a springboard|user:someone buys a a handgun and like i say a week or two weeks as a cooling off period|user:as just that a waiting period before	towards more restrictive gun controls and	0
user:um|agent:[laughter]|user:yeah that that is true	as a as a toy you know i mean if you call a gun a toy	0
user:they could it s[eems]- it seems to me like they could bypass all the|user:it seems to me like like that that weapon|agent:yeah	i- i think the um the major concern is is that they think	0
agent:[laughter]|user:[laughter] [laughter-yeah] [noise] [laughter] yeah it's uh the [laughter-NRA] they're uh they're almost a little too radical in the other extreme i'm i'm i'm|agent:um used to be [laughter-they'd] [laughter-mention] [laughter-and] with every membership you get fifty thousand dollars dismemberment [laughter-insurance]	pretty strong in favor of of personal gun ownership	0
user:the counter argument to that|user:h[eard]- heard the that proposed before and i'm not uh discounting it completely but|user:i've i've uh	is that uh there are schools around that are uh	1
user:parochial schools around that are not staffed by nuns and|user:Catholic and other|user:uh	and i'm not a Catholic so	1
user:you can't uh you know it's a one party system so to speak then what you're going to have is gross inefficiencies and nobody cares|user:and uh|user:you've got an absolute monopoly	and reality uh uh is just not a market base system	1
agent:um and offer stuff the kids wanted and what turned out happening this was like area of the country with the highest drop out rate and all this kind of stuff [noise] and what ended up happening is people didn't just take fun classes or anything like that uh it ended up that|agent:basically the kids were allowed to take whatever classes they wanted to and go to whatever school they wanted to and it was up to the schools to attract the kids|agent:um	yes	1
agent:sanitation engineers|user:how shall i say it the garbage the guys that collect garbage and and uh|user:i i hate to see the	uh	1
agent:yeah|user:uh pretty soon people don't stop going there|user:and if somebody decides that they're going t[o]- if their decisions are out of step with reality	and uh	1

user:and uh|agent:oh yeah yeah his his popularity was somewhere close to ninety percent at the time|user:experience you know as the great American hero	yeah yeah	1
user:i i don't|user:at this early in the game i don't what i would have said then either|user:if you know if you'd asked me the same question about uh uh Kuwait you know	[noise]	0
user:attitudes at home are such i mean the kids will curse right in front of my face and they won't even go oops you know they they just have no regard and i'm not saying they're gonna turn into criminals but i think it's a general trend toward|user:an[d]- i- i find that|agent:oh you do	people just relaxing their standards so much and i think	0
user:um the people who were in the car who got hit two of them died and two of them seriously injured|user:were um in a horrible head on accident a drunk driver hit them|user:yeah we had a big incident at the local high school a teacher who happened to be a parent and four girls	this guy you know crossed a divider he had been arrested twice for drunk dri[ving]- driving	0
agent:but yeah that's true yeah|user:[laughter]|agent:i guess that's why we have the problem nobody seems to [laughter-know] what to do about it	[noise] you know and then they bring up the thing about um whether we should have death penalties	1
agent:and um then i learned to budget really fast [laughter] um|agent:until i quit going to Georgia Tech|agent:i've n[ever]- i've didn't really ever have to have a budget um	[laughter]	1
agent:um-hum|agent:[laughter]|user:and about this time of year is when i get religion i have to do my income taxes i realize that better recording keeping would've helped and uh	i still haven't managed to uh	1
user:kept a formal|user:i would find and maybe learn how to control if i uh|user:uh on a monthly basis and come pretty close but i'm sure that there are a bunch of surprises in there that uh	budget or uh financial plan	1
user:uh so i would be better if i had a budget and i had a certain amount of uh fun money|user:[laughter] and uh|agent:[noise] yeah	that had to be spent each month or that was allowed to be spent each month i'd feel better about it [noise]	1
user:right|user:yep [noise]|agent:it's hard to see that right now even though you know you have too	well i've made my confession	1
agent:i i w[ould]- i|user:that's been [laughter-my] [laughter-experience] and|agent:yeah	and i really think that i think that judges are very prejudice	0
agent:i think that that in of itself is a sin|user:yes|agent:excuse me you plead to a lesser crime	yes	1
agent:it's a lot of money|user:i mean it's one million dollars which to you and i sound exorbitant|user:well yes but if you look at it in relation to the amount	but compared to the six hundred million	0
agent:now i don't know of a lot of people that are well there are and there aren't and|user:yeah|agent:i agree with that there are worse things that people have been getting off with but i don't think that that we then should have Leona get off i think that they should be hit even harder see i'm an advocate of the death penalty myself	well	1
agent:go ahead|user:[noise]|agent:[noise] okay	uh	0
user:uh i know that f[rom]- because my son is a a scout now and uh|agent:um-hum|user:popular one but uh one that is not typically recognized as such is the Boy Scouts	is thinking about	0
agent:right right|user:uh military service falls under the category uh of a public service|user:right of course um	and so uh one of the things that would fulfill the at least the nominal	0
agent:you know and because the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially as as an instrument of US foreign policy|agent:but um you know for some people that's good i i don't particular like the fact that it's the military|user:why is that	oh no no no it's to defend the nation against external evils	1
agent:oh|user:okay well i've i worked i don't work right now because_1 my company i worked for PIE went bankrupt|user:oh	but um they was getting a program set up that for all new hires	1
user:[noise] but uh|agent:yeah definitely|user:[laughter-of] any kind [laughter-you] [laughter-know]	i don't know whether i believe that they should just randomly do it	1
agent:if we're first time offenders|agent:part of our pay is docked|agent:we get counseling and uh i think	oh i	1
user:uh|user:you know|agent:yeah	it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore	1
agent:oh|user:like i say maybe one of these days i'll get a job because i am looking still for a part-time job you know since my company went bankrupt and i'll see what they do you know|user:i don't know	but like i say i- i wouldn't care because i	0
agent:[laughter]|user:my goodness well i'm in Texas so i sound i found sound very Texan|agent:[laughter] Phil here in Rochester New York [laughter]	[laughter]	1
user:and uh uh uh|user:well i'm not see i i i take Time|user:uh-huh	off and on during my life i've taken uh Good Housekeeping	0
agent:i it's probably my second favorite of the news magazines|agent:[laughter] yeah that i- i- i- like Time a little bit uh|agent:[laughter]	well you think Newsweek might be a better	1
user:right|agent:you know she has her choice to do|agent:believe that i have a particular say over what someone else some woman has	well we won't fight over this because you know i me myself i don't know that i'm forty six	0
agent:sure|user:before she had her little bouncing baby boy|agent:uh-huh	you know so there's things like that happen of course now they they didn't she wouldn't consider an abortion	0

user:[noise]|agent:um-hum|user:where there's l[ot]- a lot of drug and uh broken families and things like that	uh	0
agent:yeah|user:yes the gang problems [noise]|agent:oh you know two black guys killed each other or they knifed each other other to death and we have a lot with uh gang problems	the the p[roblem]-	1
user:the|user:about a four hour topic but a five minute uh window here so|user:this is uh	for me i	1
user:the|user:uh how shall i say it uh the problems of crime affect|user:so even though i see	black working class	0
user:the Bill of Rights doesn't exit for those guys if you are standing at a corner and somebody and the Bobby walks up to you and he says you've been standing here four buses have gone by|user:and it basically boils down to they don't have|user:i- i read a discussion once of of uh the reason why England for instance uh has their gun problems and other problems are so low	uh you're a pickpocket empty your pockets	0
agent:[laughter-you] [laughter-know]|agent:[laughter-you] [laughter-know] and that's really not right and then they go out and do it again|user:yeah an ac[tually]-	that's right and and like i my earlier example uh	1
agent:that's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like|agent:yeah that's|user:you know and it it's that kind of thing and uh	yeah we have a neighborhood watch program in the house um the development that we live in which i think is a great way to reduce	0
agent:huh|user:so i've heard that's really on the rise as far as um you know|agent:yeah	a new type of crime	1
user:you're supposed to make lists of um cars like i know a lot of my neighbors right around my development if i see a car that's|user:yeah it helps to know your neighbors you know they give you|agent:i think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis i'm not real sure uh	unfamiliar we we have a list is that what you you did in your program where you have a list of license plates	0
user:um-hum that's|agent:considering electrifying doors um things like that like they did in Miami that time|agent:when i was getting robbed down in Florida i was really	um-hum	1
user:um [noise]|user:uh|agent:hi	i i should say something	0
user:things like that but um|user:well no i i've i've explored that with lots of people uh they've tried to lock me up and uh|user:but	um	0
user:l[argely]- largely from friends and i occasionally will read something like the New York Review Of Books you know someone will write a book about something|agent:uh-huh|user:i do learn about things	and then i'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier	0
agent:and the view that i'd [laughter-rather] take is that|agent:uh i guess you could explain it two ways and and the cynical view is [noise] well these things aren't doing a very good job at all|agent:uh without thinking that there were people in who think each other areas area of of specialty and	uh-huh	1
agent:you know accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it|agent:and most people think it is and i can i can|user:yeah what	yeah by the way when you say most people think it is i think it's like ninety nine point ninety nine think it is percent	0
user:uh the whole business of uh|user:[noise] the Supreme Court hearings uh the for um|user:on the uh	see i i actually have a a	0
user:but even then|user:watching it for a couple of hours zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and ea[ting]- watching it some more and i thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on|user:engrossed in that we ended up	i didn't end up doing it on my own	0
agent:are you saying that the chi[ldren]- that the s[tudents]- uh teachers are wearing jeans|user:and what i find out nowadays is people are wearing jeans and and very casual things Polo shirts [laughter-uh] i'm of the opinion that i'm not one of the kids and i want them to know that so i'll dress a little more formally i mean not a business suit but you know a nice skirt and blouse or|user:oh i suppose i uh substitute teach in our public schools	well i- i should clarify i work in the i'm an artist and i work in the art department so perhaps	0
user:uh|user:uh you know as much as i'm there to be their|agent:uh-huh	to be there for them but i'm not their friend i'm there to teach them something and i[t's]- it's business and it's serious and	1
agent:probably most of them wear long sleeve shirts without ties|agent:wear the men wear uh um|agent:uh wear dresses or slacks and um	hm	1
user:i think it was just um clothing and how you feel about it and do you change your wardrobe from season to season|agent:whatever|agent:to uh	um i guess the warmer it gets the less clothing i [laughter-wear] but i don't know that i i change my sense of color or style to	0
agent:with not a whole lot of discretionary money it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it|agent:long term considerations college and retirement but|agent:so we're we're starting to think about	sure	1
user:[laughter-e[xactly]-] [laughter-exactly] and if you can't touch it you can't spend it either so that kind of works out where you get into uh some plans that|agent:and the old uh if you can't see it then you can't spend it uh idea [laughter]|user:that's kind of how we do it anyway but	you know you touch it you're going to get a penalty that kind of thing so	0
user:it grows uh it it seems like at first you're not gonna see a big return but as the years go on if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better|user:oh definitely definitely and uh|agent:wish i could afford to uh put more away each week because_1 i agree that it's a an excellent way	and uh	1
user:and you don't get a good return on it anyway so|user:you know long term type of planning so|user:y[ou]- you better have some other way of uh savings otherwise uh checking accounts aren't the best for	other	1
user:yeah it's it drops so your better bet is to uh|user:kind of took them_1 out of that because they got so low but uh|user:that uh had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and uh	try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of uh	0
agent:right i'm a grandfather so basically i'm getting interested in raising kids again and|user:[laughter-Parenting] and Car and Driver i see|agent:right now i think my favorite ones are Parenting and Car and Driver	uh-huh	1
user:that's it's invaluable when if you're shopping for a new car even if you're looking for an old one because it tells you history of repairs and that sort of things on different models|user:and uh|user:yeah well i think it's the April issue i do get that one and the April issue always compares all the new cars	so i think it is a worthwhile magazine	1
user:that i[t]- that year end book that Consumer Reports put out is sometimes a little condensed too|user:yeah that uh|user:yeah	you may not get the full article	0
agent:so you're a home builder you're|user:you know if i ever build the ultimate dream home [laughter-or] [laughter-something] [laughter-i'll] [laughter-know] [laughter-how] [laughter-to] [laughter-do] [laughter-it]|user:[noise] which is another one that has nice pictures in it	no [laughter] not really	1
user:but i have to confess i've never read Car and Driver|user:articles that help you repair things|user:they often have uh	or Parenting [laughter-as] [laughter-a] [laughter-matter] [laughter-of] [laughter-fact]	1
agent:oh and i confess i've got one other magazine TV Guide|user:yeah i|agent:yeah i stopped doing that a long time ago	oh	0
user:um|agent:[laughter]|agent:yeah	i don't know the the things they asked to talk about were whether the uh	1
agent:maybe uh|user:that's right|agent:like everybody else even though they're they're supposed to be impartial but	and i think that may i that may be an exception as well because_1 i think that doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than	0
agent:not it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge it's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people|agent:i guess the way i think about it is|user:yeah	uh-huh	1
agent:that's been so long i've prac[tically]- practically forgot who Noriega was you know|agent:yeah that's|agent:[laughter]	right	1
agent:they can if they|agent:so it's just sort of um|user:and been tested	they can if they choose to	1
agent:and she tested positive for that|agent:but what it was was she had been u[sing]- she had been um in the jungle and it was some Malaria medication|user:uh-huh	see and so it really is a dangerous thing that way	0
user:um|user:but|agent:see i always i thought they got you got called back if you tested positive for more test	you should because you should be given another chance or at least	0
user:and my doctor gave me a prescription for it and he said this way|agent:uh-huh|user:i- i interviewed for a job recently and i was taking Entex	if it were to make the drug test positive	0
user:then|agent:i mean|user:yeah i'm not sure either the only way i can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it	they have the right to go ahead and prove it because they say they can spot check	1
agent:yeah|user:you can't go around testing everybody for everything|agent:yeah	so i don't know and i- i think it could be used to hassle somebody	0
user:that's the other thing i mean a lot of|agent:i know|user:maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago	a lot of people	0
agent:actually my dad's my dad's almost ninety and he lives by himself and he's in good shape um|agent:um well i|user:who were ready who who who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for	hm	1
user:nice enough uh it it's hard at least half of the residents i would say are not|user:um i mean the the environment there i don't know too much about it but it it seems|user:and it seems	not mentally sound so it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to re[tain]- to retain	0
user:[vocalized-noise] too old ess[entially]- essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house|user:who who are just|user:um it must be depressing for the people who who are	but but certainly um certainly have a[re]- a[re]- are have retained all of their uh mental skills and so on it's must be depressing to to walk	0
user:and so y[ou]-|agent:um-hum so it gives them a sense of identity|agent:um-hum	yeah you walked in there and it didn't look like uh you know how you you walk into some rooms and there's it's completely generic there's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person and that's it but this room on the other hand you know they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that and they had all their stuff from their house and it looked like a	0
agent:uh low key place as far as dress goes [noise] you just wear uh let's see when i first came here i wore|agent:i work at Tektronix and it's a very|agent:well let's see it turns out that uh Tek[tronix]-	um-hum	1
user:you know nicer usually nice summer slacks or more sometimes skirts stuff like that|user:and that's [vocalized-noise] so generally then i dress|agent:um-hum	so	0
agent:whether i was a worker bee or a manager|agent:it was obvious that people didn't know|agent:[noise]	wow	1
user:because_1 here|agent:yes i[t]- it is|user:oh well that's nice that's good for the clothes budget i would imagine	gosh we had uh	0
agent:and you know you it's i've learned to hang up on them but sometimes it's not so [laughter-easy]|user:yeah|agent:constantly every single organization	yeah i- i got some call last night i'm trying to remember	0
agent:well there's another one the account balance line all you got to know is the person's zip code|user:yeah [vocalized-noise] they they fixed it so you had to give some information out but|agent:program and i love it you can call up on one of the lines the	right	1
agent:huh|user:you know it it's like you know the best example is probably credit reports now|user:and you know there there's a lot of of risk involved there because	where where you know God knows what goes on those things i mean th[ankfully]- thankfully now you can get your reports for free	0
agent:and getting proof for these people i mean it's not my job you're the one that screwed up and you know if you want to damage my credit rating that's fine but i will take whatever actions are appropriate to protect it|user:yeah|agent:oh yeah it's a pain in the neck because_1 they you know they['ll]- they'll believe these companies in a second over the individual	um	1
user:well you know there's much more subtle kinds of invasions of privac[y]- like every time you call an eight hundred number|user:right|user:ri[ght]-	you're giving them_1 your phone number	1
user:and uh i've been divorced for um eighteen years|user:i am from Mars i mean i'm fifty years old|user:yeah well i- i i i feel like um	but i've two kids and all but i uh	0
user:uh|user:but really i'm i'm in a happy i i well i'm curious how other people live|agent:that sounds kind of like me	so maybe	0
user:the um|user:huh|agent:[laughter-and] then we [laughter-started] [laughter-borrowing] [laughter-from] [laughter-one] [laughter-envelope] [laughter-to] [laughter] [laughter-put] it in the [laughter-other] envelope and [laughter] in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do	i had a part-time job around	0
agent:[laughter]|user:it's one of the problems i never had to in the past i always kept plenty of money in my checking account but when you're only earning half the salary|user:i well i didn't keep a balance [laughter]	even though i wasn't spending much money i sometimes would just	0
user:but i would forget to write the things down and i[t]- it that|agent:uh-huh|user:i spent on food so i could do better planning	i i don't know if i ever went as far as three months or not [laughter]	1
user:that let's see at this point on i don't run out of money|user:i- i have to say|user:the uh i	um	0
agent:it was still running|agent:[laughter]|user:pe[ople]- people were embarrassed for me i mean it was it was a good car	and	1
agent:yeah|user:maybe once a month|user:i only do that every week or um without even i mean	i mean you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound you buy a a less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars to me i realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that	0
user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	wha[t]- wha[t]- what sort of company do you work for do you work for a big place or a little place	1
agent:uh|agent:right|user:a technical institution	uh while i was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to trying to think of what uh	0
agent:and you know their well being as far as you know how they go[ing]- their next dollars gonna come in how they gonna pay them bills they just lay them_1 off|agent:because when it come down to layoff they don't really consider people and|user:um-hum	yeah	1
agent:there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them_1 all at one time|agent:you know that there are problems and you know|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:and i think you can do that for a little while but i'm|agent:right|user:and uh have gave everybody a half day a week off	yeah	1
user:so i think indirectly there there is extra AIDS|user:so i would suspect that you know pneumonia i think is one of them and and the cancers and whatnot|user:so	research being done	1
user:one reason maybe that the the funding level is as high as it is is because|user:well do you think that|user:yeah	AIDS perhaps strikes uh a vocal group of people	1
agent:for uh indigent [vocalized-noise] AIDS patients|agent:the that a majority of the hospitals resources should not go for|agent:you know that	that's right well certainly if you have AIDS unless you're incredibly wealthy you're going to end up indigent	1
user:newspapers no i'm not too much in reading newspapers uh not that i don't enjoy newspapers or anything like that but|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:you don't get any newspapers	um	0
user:yeah|agent:yeah two newspapers in the morning|user:you read it in the morning then	um-hum	1
agent:place to be to|user:[laughter-exactly] exactly|agent:everybody was watching CNN that seemed to be the	exactly sure	1
user:differently or don't even|user:do it|user:you know you know a lot of people that read the news to newspapers to get the news of what's going on and uh other people that you know	watch any news at all so	1
agent:yeah|user:sure i suppose you watch for hurr[icanes]- hurricanes coming in and|agent:weather is still warm here	things like that sure	0
user:sounds pretty good so|user:yeah that's|user:[laughter] to take off sure	anyway i don't know if our time is getting up here or it's got to be fairly close to that	1
user:and that's one reason i have so many [laughter] because i really|user:i think you're right because i was an only child too|agent:they're the pivot point of the universe	i enjoyed the big family	0
agent:[noise] did y'all do a lot of organized things like uh Little League uh soccer an[d]-|user:entertain each other and i was home more|user:but um yeah it's it's a little bit difficult though i think it was easier when they all had each other and could	and	1
agent:and they practice three times a week and they have a game and it's just uh if there were more than one child i don't know there there would be no way to do it|agent:like my son is in uh Little League this year he's ten|user:right	right that's right	1
user:and it's just my thirteen year old and myself and so we really have to|agent:um-hum [noise]|user:when i did this now i do work full time	keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other	1
agent:and come down here and i work with a lot of them_1 they they think they they've really done something then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous|user:that's what i've heard|user:right	hm	1
agent:um-hum i i agree|user:a a a good amount of money ought to go to the education which they they d[oing]- seem to be doing|user:uh i think	uh because i think you want to stop it before it gets t[o]- you know it's not the kind of thing you can reverse if you've got to stop it before it starts	1
user:uh but you know i get called sporadically and they needed this lab assistance in the neighborhood and said you didn't have to have experience i'm really an artist but i figured oh you know i'll find out what it is|agent:right|user:and they s[aid]- they needed a lab assistant and i'm working part-time now i'm a substitute teacher	and she she very casually said well think about whether you want to this because there are lab animals and blah blah blah and	0
agent:for a large amount|agent:so they tend to isolate them and leave them|agent:the hours are long and there's a lot of people	right yeah how can you feel when there's a sign on your door [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-i]	0
agent:um i|user:so i guess you're saying you think we should spend more for AIDS research|user:uh	i'm not i don't really know what we are spending actually	1
user:yeah well i have the same thing [laughter] and i understand because_1 i live very close to Dallas|agent:you know i[t]- it also concerns me because i have a convertible and uh you know there's certain areas around here where i'd be afraid to drive with my top down|agent:uh	so we have quite a crime rate too but	0
agent:sure|user:where they don't just eat up our tax dollars|user:and put them to work doing something useful	and that's kind of what we've come up with [laughter]	1
agent:uh [laughter]|user:that's right|agent:but putting it that way that is kind of ironic that she'd be using up tax dollars but	you know that really is true	1
user:yeah and also i think that they can get off on too many technicalities|agent:you know uh|user:yeah	i think that it turns out sometimes that the victims are the ones that	1
agent:my my fiance's a lawyer so i definitely understand that|user:and that's the way it is and so|agent:sure	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:because i don't know the people all i've read is uh|agent:it's for me it's hard to talk about uh specifics|agent:well	um-hum	1
agent:if if a dishonest person is uh good for us we'll keep him in office|agent:yes and that's again the what you said earlier about people get what they deserve they say well i[f]-|user:i mean normally it's yeah okay what big scandal but it comes times to reelect them they say hey this is the guy that brings home the bacon for us you know he's got seniority on all these committees we're not gonna replace him	yeah and i mean also	0
user:you know you've got|user:i- i mean the problem is that|agent:uh act as an honest person	as i said there's no incen[tive]- incentive to go into [vocalized-noise] look at our state legislature and things where very nominal pay but there's also not you know	0
user:i- i think it depends a lot on|agent:and there's a lot of corruption|agent:you scratch my back i'll scratch yours uh i would even i would disagree with you a little bit because i think that in the state level that's just part of the uh the internship so to speak	on the state i think that it varies from state to state	1
agent:and clear out the employees and we're losing more and more jobs and uh|agent:every single time there's you know th[e]- the first thing they do is they fire employees whenever there's a problem with the uh uh ec[onomy]- economy|user:i know	and it just gets worse then people don't don't spend any money	1
user:[laughter]|agent:Buffalo and Pittsburgh and cities around here that were into mechanical and engineering and things like that steel mills they're all gone they're all in Mexico now [laughter]|user:right [laughter]	yeah w[e're]- we're just kind of like losing and it it just seems to be a snowball effect i mean [vocalized-noise] you know we keep losing more	1
user:we're trying|agent:well i heard Apple was remaking themselves into a consumer electronics company|user:and that's really bad	and if it works tha[t's]- that'd be great for us but what about you know the rest of the industry	1
user:perhaps the automotive industry is improving but uh like ten years ago|user:repair actually uh that is really a sore spot with me i i think|agent:[laughter]	um	0
agent:bad you know|agent:they're really good cars every time i get taken to an auto repair place you know every time i go i get taken|agent:yeah we used to have a Honda Accord and they're good	hm	1
agent:than nothing|agent:it was no more new|agent:just awful	so apparently it was the same one that was on there	1
agent:[laughter-yeah] yeah i am so|user:well that's wonderful|agent:yeah i just pay for the parts and he does it so	you're lucky	1
agent:that's great|user:and i'm very handy and you know if i touch it i it turns [laughter-into] [laughter-something] [laughter-u[sually]-]|agent:oh okay	usually and	1
user:and that way i have time for my kids too and|agent:yeah|user:so i'm a licensed teacher but jobs being what they are i substitute teach	i've been fortunate that i can afford to work part time i don't know how long [laughter-that's] [laughter-gonna] [laughter-last]	0
agent:wha[t]-|agent:band saw|user:[laughter] we did it on a w[e]- i had a uh i did it through Adult Ed again	i did it through Adult Ed again	0
agent:now did you cut a quarter wedge in this|user:so|agent:right	um i'd say it's about an eighth you know just	1
user:quickly or whatever or however you wanna say it|user:pocket it a little bit quick|user:small corporations they seem to	and uh	0
user:sure|agent:well i've worked for uh well i worked for H and R Block here in Massachusetts for awhile|agent:right	um-hum	1
user:wow|user:um-hum|agent:right and we have the eye glasses the health care and the whole kit and caboodle because what they did is they threw the all the town employees in together	that's extremely good	0
user:um|user:health care uh you had your insurance and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a a very small place|user:um you know things like that so i've been looking at big corporations and saying the big corporation that i've worked for in the past had the pension plans had the big health	they don't have	0
agent:hopefully will go through|user:sure|user:uh-huh	sure	1
user:uh-huh yeah|user:yeah|agent:which was really great because_1 we don't have to pay a mayor [laughter]	yeah i know what you mean and that's true i mean yeah i[t]- it does end up being quite a bit when you have to	0
agent:[noise]|user:[noise] uh do you know anyone that uh has	is in a nursing home or has ever been in one	1
agent:oh they thought it was too much of a bother|user:you know a a nuisance or worse than a nuisance i mean sh[e]-|user:being a a	she sort of went you know bananas and they couldn't couldn't deal with her	1
user:um the first few years she had her own apartment and you know made her own meals sometimes but could|user:place that was also associated with it so for|user:there was some sort of full-time care	could also go and eat someplace else	0
user:some i don't know whether that's because they you know sort of give up hope once they get in there or|user:that move into nursing homes die very quickly and that's|user:but my experience has been that most people	what the	0
agent:somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency|agent:so that was their thinking|user:uh-huh	right	1
agent:it's just a shame that's the way it has to be i think the retirement home idea's a nice idea to go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay and|user:have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing|user:well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to	yeah	1
agent:[noise]|user:[laughter] i guess uh|user:is that right	the um the only rule i can think of is that uh	1
agent:yes|user:oh you mean uh learning type uh [noise] yeah i mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission but|agent:pet theories or some such thing	yeah i suppose um	1
agent:um-hum|user:very rare but quickly exploited and made public so i never really worried too much about that being uh|user:yeah i never really worry very much about it i tend to think those are	uh the case with my boys	0
agent:finding some cases they're finding that it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in day care|user:[noise]|user:that	right	1
user:so we did look around i think my wife|agent:[noise]|agent:hm	is much better than i am at just walking into a place and getting a feeling for [noise] whether it's a loving and caring place or not	0
user:you have the main thing is that you have to|user:uh commit your child to them_1 and i think|agent:um-hum	determine that they're perfectly open that you're welcome anytime	0
user:um-hum|agent:um i have one but i haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while|user:child care	so	0
agent:Current Affair can get [laughter] several [laughter-shows] [laughter-with] [laughter-those] [laughter-cases]|user:yeah|agent:this is true	[laughter-yeah]	1
user:ah|agent:yeah i'm in computer science|user:huh are you in the scientific field or something	well uh my thoughts about magazines are	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh|agent:[laughter]	um i have a cooking magazine i like because_1 i like to cook and there's some this thing called Country Home which has	0
agent:right|user:housewife type [laughter]|user:you know things that would make me not sound like the typical you know cutesy	but i guess in magazines i gue[ss]- i you know i run the line i suppose that's true	0
user:um|user:you know wood carving that looked interesting and you know you just find these things that|agent:right	-[we]ll it's refreshing to pick up something that you would never go to a rack for i think	1
user:well i'll just briefly um i worked in a nursing home so i kind of know from way back uh how things used to be run and i think there's been definite changes of nursing homes but|user:[noise] okay|agent:[noise]	i think uh	0
user:you know i look at it and say thank God i|user:i think the patients weren't given the quality of care that i wouldn't have|user:um	got out of that kind of situation but uh	0
agent:a nursing home but|user:um-hum|agent:i guess i haven't had that much experience i've only seen like my great grandparents in	yeah	1
user:and|agent:nice sedative state|user:uh quiet and	yeah yeah and they would just lay all day long and uh	1
user:and it was kind of funny when i look back at it but|agent:uh-huh|user:go out on i don't know what they call it a binge or whatever you want to say it but she grabbed a hold of this	i mean i remember the patient getting very upset	1
agent:i there's a lot more personal attention|agent:it seem like the small town nursing homes|user:yeah yeah	i don't know	1
user:and i look back at it and say jeez you know i it would have to be awfully bad for|agent:uh-huh|user:this is back in nineteen seventy seven that i worked there	me to put my parents in there but my grandmother	1
user:stress today is so much worse it should be less because|user:you're expected to exactly and i recently read an article on just this that said|agent:because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute	we have a microwave and our grandmother's had to bake brownies and	0
user:so that's good that's an interesting point|agent:um-hum|user:your time in between things	but i just think our our family lives have changed drastically	0
user:really are on their original mother and father|user:so -[th]ere's a whole big effect on our kids and not very many of my daughter's friends|user:a lot of working both parents are working	you know i'm wondering what this is going to do	0
agent:to be good [laughter]|agent:is necessarily considered|user:that's true	right right	1
EMPTY	[noise] okay	0
user:it's really weird uh i don't stay up late to watch late news because_1 my eyes won't stay up that long|agent:hm|user:but uh and then when five o'clock comes around i just wanna get in the house and turn the TV on to watch the news	but um [noise] i love to watch the five o'clock news and i	0
agent:okay [laughter]|agent:yes|user:[noise] hello sir [noise] yes i'm sorry to keep you waiting [laughter] um	i was calling from work so and that was a call waiting	1
agent:[laughter] yeah Georgia here they're usually wrong too we have weird weather systems|agent:me too|user:[noise] just uh especially the weather i like that [laughter] although they're usually wrong [laughter]	uh-huh	1
agent:i get up just barely in time to get up get ready and get off to work and then at work i have no time to read the news|user:[laughter]|agent:i- i i'm not a morning person so i would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news [laughter]	oh	1
agent:the amount of support that's given and the amount of uh bureaucracy you have to deal with and other things like that|agent:because of the|agent:uh and there are some people who who just die here	are are you saying that that there's more bureaucracy et cetera at out in California	0
user:but i had never given that much thought|agent:um-hum|user:really using i mean now that i'm raising my kids i'm substitute teaching because the hours are so good et cetera	to whether i actually liked to teach	0
agent:with guaranteed admission into an engineering degree for a Master's degree|agent:and they are moving here towards a program where they have a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Science combined where you get a general education|user:um-hum	oh that	1
agent:uh other than that i don't really have any benefits per se how about yourself|agent:i guess in a perfect world in a perfect world uh but we aren't in a perfect world so i don't know|user:um-hum	well i'm fortunate in that i have uh dental and i also have vision care the thing that i have had in the past that i wish that my company provided was uh a prescription a paid prescription plan	1
agent:oh not too large that's part of the problem with the uh the health care program it's prob[ably]- maybe uh twelve people|user:how large is your company|agent:i'm a broker i work with a uh brokerage house and we work with businesses in brokering their services or goods to other businesses	oh you're right well the company i work for now in my office we have about eight people but it's like two thousand people overall	1
user:uh|agent:or do you have to take them in bulk|agent:can you split your holiday or vacation time into personal days	the vacation i think i can split you know i don't have to take it two or a week at a time or anything like that	0
user:the office is pretty free you know as far as if i decide that i want to go out to lunch with someone and i'm late coming back|user:uh|user:but uh	no one complains or says anything about it and if i need some time off to go to a doctor they wouldn't penalize me for that	0
agent:right|user:San Francisco Giants|agent:[vocalized-noise]	uh but honestly you know i uh	0
agent:well yeah [laughter] sorry about that yeah uh as far as the Twins are concerned it seems to be real good|user:[noise] oh good i i assume that means good for the Minnesota|agent:uh real good as far as i can tell people are pretty excited about	[laughter]	1
user:um-hum|agent:uh he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good|agent:the Oakland A's a couple times	[noise] i guess they're in different leagues is that right the A's	1
agent:yeah|user:i mean eighty six times two|agent:yeah well j[ust]- just about yeah	is a hundred and sixty	1
agent:i think it's great um i think like socialized medicine|user:h[ow]- h[ow]- how do you feel about that|agent:[noise]	um-hum	1
user:either my parents|user:health insurance through my uh|user:i've had	uh employment or my employment for many years but uh	0
user:universal|user:with uh|user:the the problem that i have with	health insurance is the problem of basically just absolute and complete distrust	1
user:that they would not|user:uh|user:that they would	use it as a	0
user:young man he said uh|user:you know it's very interesting the guy on the other end is a|user:you know what's the unem[ployed]- what do i get if i'm unemployed and how long will i get it	uh with a good sense of humor he says well he says right now it's twenty six weeks uh	0
user:on the other hand like i say they|agent:yeah you don't really think about it until you you're in a situation where you have to think about it|agent:right	i have i have lived in places where they had uh	0
user:uh in order to get enough|user:that|user:the way it worked in practice was	doctors	0
user:now i know how people that don't have insurance feel and on the other hand i'm saying uh|user:i'm saying well|user:i'm	i don't trust the politicians very much	0
agent:want trash cans which match their kitchen cabinets|agent:it's the new thing around here is people|user:all right	oh that's rather clever i hadn't thought of that [laughter]	1
user:yeah|agent:type of thing|agent:type of	yeah well th[e]- the thing i like about the two magazines i mentioned is they're so inspirational [laughter]	1
user:uh-huh|agent:how did you miter the corners|agent:the crown molding around the top and the the tricky part was not making up the crown molding it was how did you cut it	i know	1
agent:you have to set it like on flagstone or concrete or something|agent:teak is awfully expensive but the the thing about teak is you can't set it on the ground|agent:yeah	does it whit too badly or what	1
agent:so you might file that if you don't mind paying the long distance charges|user:oh is that right|agent:and they're happy to talk to you	huh	1
user:yeah it just never occurred to us to have a a family [rev[iew]-/reunion] reunion i|user:uh|agent:right that's when you see everybody is when somebody dies it's awful [laughter]	you know i[t]- i guess the thought occurred to me that the people i didn't talk to on a regular basis	0
agent:and we ended up bringing you know plus extras for everybody else that we knew about that was coming we said whoa we'll make a couple of hundred cannolis and [laughter] [laughter] and we'll bring them and somebody said well i'll bring a couple of barrels of steamers and show ev[erybody]- and show off how well we can cook them_1 and|user:uh-huh|agent:and it it more or less turned out we brought food for our own family the people like my father my mother and myself my husband and my kids	oh	1
agent:uh well she's been dead a year now and before anybody else dies [laughter]|agent:so it's like|user:oh	oh right [laughter-that's] [laughter-true]	1
user:um-hum|user:um-hum|agent:that way i know how much pocket change i'm going to have left [laughter-at] [laughter-the] [laughter-end] of the month or at the end of the paycheck anyway	uh-huh	1
user:and um|agent:um-hum|user:and usually that's enough	but i don't have any you know small children to have anything extra come up you know like uh running to the doctor or something like that with them	1
user:yeah so you know i really have to try to budget|agent:that last week's pretty lean generally [laughter-speaking] so|agent:and	that i don't go over that amount you know each month	1
agent:uh-huh|user:i also like belong to a Christmas club be[cause]- you know i used to belong to a Christmas club last year i didn't|user:uh-huh	then so then naturally Christmas comes along and that's puts you behind too you know	0
user:i'm taking like um|user:oh that's good|agent:yeah i i was pretty fortunate this Christmas i didn't get in debt so	sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what i can	0
agent:well this is another way that i'm making a little extra money so that was you know nice that i tripped over this opportunity and you're actually my first call|user:um-hum|agent:well that's a good way to to make a little extra money	oh really	0
user:so you think if if trials were held by judges or experts that they they would tend not to|agent:and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me i don't know|agent:i mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have a eyewitness	uh admit	0
agent:um-hum|user:uh they do the questioning also the judges do the questioning and uh|user:there [noise] there really isn't a jury and uh	they uh [noise]	0
agent:well that's true|user:a jury [noise] what i what i worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual that's where you really need a jury of peers|user:couple of judges or	because uh	0
user:um|user:i guess i don't think that uh|user:well	juries need to decide sentencing all the time	0
user:but people who do[n't]- who don't have day in and day out life long experience with|agent:right|user:make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent that's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe	what prison's really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case	0
agent:right|user:[noise] but in a lot of places i think people bend over the other way but|user:hanging jury atmosphere	i guess	1
user:where [noise]|agent:yeah|user:insurance cases and things like that	and um there'd be more honest settlements instead of this um	1
agent:well you're probably right up here in Rochester we uh|user:[noise] well i think Don that maybe immigration is more of an issue in my part of the country than it is in yours do you suppose that's true|agent:[noise]	but	1
user:unfortunately i think that that|user:uh|agent:uh-huh	the immigrants tend to really stretch the social services	1
agent:because it it was it was a discriminatory practice|agent:uh back in the thirties didn't want to hire the Italian immigrants|agent:uh it's fairly well known that at one of the major companies in Rochester who i won't say their name but i'm sure you've heard of them	huh	1
user:um-hum|agent:far too much for what we get i mean it's just|agent:sure we pay far too much in taxes well	i agree	1
user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:right [vocalized-noise] i don't mind them getting what they need it's just when they pay so much for it it takes very you know very little to just shop around and|user:you know ten or fifteen i mean that kind of thing and uh	exactly	1
agent:sure|user:but you're still gonna owe the government as much money so|agent:[laughter]	by the end of this coming year what's gonna happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government	0
user:no no|agent:and people don't care anymore either p[eople]- people don't wanna go out to vote|agent:and	well i don't think people think they can make a difference and when you've got candidates as you do it's candidates that have money	0
user:each state take care of itself|user:and|agent:[laughter]	and no government type of uh you know	0
agent:um-hum|user:a few answering machines over the last two years just because i've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly|user:i don't feel like that's as big a problem i've had	and i'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent	0
agent:um-hum|user:and i was really disappointed with that i felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable|user:so we got the kind we wanted	and i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends and i called there to see if they had it	0
EMPTY	[noise] ah	1
user:i know how none i know how America comes across to|user:could say that|user:i guess i could	other countries from my	0
agent:preferences to Europe to help them recover and completely ignored the South American beef and|agent:we gave all sorts of special trade|agent:because uh something like after the war	uh-huh	1
user:the fact that i there were a lot of uneducated Mexicans|user:totally uh colored by|user:uh my impression of Latins was was	and uh	1
agent:yeah|user:totally white blonde haired people from i think it was Uruguay|user:i i met some people who were	and uh so they told me a little about they said well this is	0
agent:uh Indian race you know an[d]- and Mexico has a lot of that and that's why you know you get sort of the Spanish Mexicans who who aren't really as common that you see in|agent:you know you you've got uh uh different races uh in in the Andean countries you have a big|agent:uh especially from country to country but even within countries	uh-huh	1
user:pretty much forever well they've just decided now when our county where i am is looking at|agent:right|user:yeah it's as a matter of fact they recently in our county here our state sales tax has been seven percent	upping the tax rate to eight percent to try and close a deficit	0
user:they turned it off yet they're still giving money to all these|agent:yeah|user:people complaining you know well it was only saving two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year it's jus[t]- we're paying good tax money for this and	bizarre things in New York City	0
user:[noise]|user:yeah we're|agent:small but small but uh i got it back anyway	we're just sitting down tonight to	0
agent:um-hum that sounds about right [laughter]|user:did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and you know checkbooks an[d]- all those kind of thing and we kept that going for about a month and it became so onerous that we gave up on it [laughter]|user:i	you know so uh	1
user:that's|user:um|agent:right	really about	0
agent:what i get from the state with my bills and um you know try to work as many days as possible|user:oh dear|agent:at this point because there's no other way to do it and my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support [laughter] so right now i know what i'm getting from the state and um i have to balance more or less	um-hum	1
user:my next door neighbor|user:yeah you're the first you -[kn]ow uh|user:uh-huh	just lost his job	0
user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:sure|user:uh hang on one second i've got [noise]	[noise]	0

agent:oh can't wait|agent:and|user:oh tell me about it you ready for Dayton	[laughter]	1
agent:uh as much as anything else i don't know it seems to me that if i had that kind of money i would feel like i were more influential as a private citizen than as the president|agent:you know just the sense of power and the sense of being able to accomplish things|user:[laughter]	well that could be uh	0
user:some retired Army guys to go in after him and and supposedly even i think went in by him[self]- with|user:hired uh|user:he	went in to see them disguised you know as somebody else	1
user:which he later sold out to General Motors and|agent:um-hum|user:until he quit there and started his own company	and uh i[t]- since then he's started a new company but i think he must be a very good salesman or at least he was at some time	0
agent:you know may take more than he's willing to put into it|agent:wi[ll]- will show up for for any variety of things but being considered seriously i think is|agent:an occasional newspaper article	yeah	0
agent:yeah|user:but nothing like [laughter-that]|agent:um-hum	i- i mean i don't know what they put Perot's wealth at i think it's probably a few billion or something i	1
agent:a a judge you're right should have the whole dossier of the [laughter-criminal]|agent:so|user:right	[vocalized-noise]	0
agent:parties wants one|agent:one of the|agent:anytime a	um-hum	1

agent:uh twenty years too um|agent:uh that would have been about|agent:i[t]- it isn't sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time in	uh-huh	1
user:in computers and i have have really resisted the|user:[noise]|user:actually you know i've been involved in electronics a long time uh	impulse to	0
agent:at school it's very easy it it's much more convenient to have one at home|agent:um but lot of times it so difficult to get on them|agent:it it's pr[etty]- very essential for me schools have them	where you going to school	1
agent:even some smaller homework assignments|agent:almost all of my report writing on on my computer uh whether it's term papers or|agent:yeah that's that and word processing is while i tend to i mean obviously i do most of my	um-hum	1
agent:hm|agent:yeah|user:i when i come home from work i i like to stay far away from computers and electronic things	uh so i let my son do it and	1

user:uh you know which are democracies|agent:um-hum|user:France that have universal service	uh	1
user:uh|user:having to take orders from a man and who knows what and [vocalized-noise]|user:you know	you know i just so i i you get you get really torn on the other hand	1
user:to to have the right to say what ought to happen|user:that it meant something to you in order|user:in other words you had to first show	uh	0
user:but i can't get one right now <e_aside>|user:<b_aside>|agent:i i think it has a lot of potential but i don't think that we're going to ever see something like that get through in this country because of the	no probably not	1
user:um so you know they kind of have gotten into the idea that let's drug test them and let's put them through rehab|user:you know whether companies wanna do this and i know that companies do like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested i know a couple of corporations that are doing that|user:um	but	1
agent:yeah you're it it's not just a com[pany's]- you're talking about company's liability|agent:well|user:uh	that's about it	1
agent:is known not to be on drugs is gonna be more healthy i don't think anybody would argue with that|agent:that a work force that|agent:uh then there's the[re's]- there's the whole question that that a	exactly	1
agent:right the question becomes what do you do about somebody who [testses/tests] who test positive|user:how can you do it|user:you know how can you	exactly	1
user:Advil or any of the Ibuprofen products out there or you've had a cold and you've been on medication or whatever you come out|user:and you've taken|user:uh let's say you do come out positive	positive	1
user:they need to go back and find out|user:can that uh if it does come out positive the first time|user:and it's a they	what medications did that person take you know what i mean it it's kind of like	1
user:i can punch the uh one|user:tell you what we can do is uh|user:[noise]	then we after five minutes when the	0
user:don't think that we uh pay too much in this country|user:i['m]- i'm probably in the minority i- i actually|user:i'm afraid i'm	um	0
user:and the sales tax can't|user:form|user:fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from a federal	i think that's regressive and uh	1
user:see the comparison between|user:but i guess when i hear whe[n]- when i|user:right [noise]	the United States and uh any other	0
user:uh-huh|agent:what we pay for it|agent:are certainly well worth uh	i'm i'm not sure i understand what you mean	1
agent:but i look for example and you you're not in the quite in the same situation but like school taxes for me|user:right|agent:because they're something you theoretically can do something about	right	1
user:do perfectly well with a uh two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools for the with the same tax money|user:countries like Canada and England and Germany|user:on our part because	but uh i mean that's uh	0
user:if you add the um|user:in areas that are fairly well off|agent:[laughter]	uh people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those who are um just looking for fun the[y]- people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get the tax bill passed no matter what happens	0
user:people would rather um increase the fire department and cut down the schools [laughter] because_1 it means more to them|user:yeah|user:right	but i think it's sad	1
user:well i'll tell you i think that is the most important thing [laughter] i've uh i'm not working right at the moment but the company that i did work for|user:um-hum|user:um-hum	[noise]	0
agent:you you really don't realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them|user:but uh man i think those medical benefits are the most important|agent:right	uh	1
user:but um|user:[laughter]|agent:yeah	that is definitely the most important um	0
agent:so|user:um-hum|agent:for Unix based workstations	no i	0
user:yes it was over three hundred fifty dollars a month if we wanted to continue our own benefits|agent:and that's exceedingly expensive|agent:and	we could do that for eighteen months	1
user:but you know what's happening is the disability plan you know so many people are lying about their things God there's been big articles in the paper about that|user:yeah right|agent:and you know of course they can use the excuse well we're a start-up	uh you know they claim a back injury and then someone goes out and spies on them and they're lifting refrigerators into trucks and	0
user:i'd have to confess to you that uh i don't know what the i honestly don't know what the law in Maryland is i think|agent:uh-huh|user:i see right from day one	we have	1
user:in favor of capital punishment in fact i think in most cases [laughter]|user:and in many cases i decide|user:it's basically you know it wha[t]- what is the net the net benefit to society if you execute someone for a particular crime versus say if you lock them up for the rest of their lives or something of that sort	uh and there probably be a few instances in which i would think that maybe it wasn't warranted	1
agent:was rampant down here in the old days|user:um|agent:uh murder was ra[mpant]- i mean uh horse horse thieving and	um-hum um-hum	1
user:but uh|agent:right um-hum|user:uh it's not a Quaker state or something of that sort you know like you know Pennsylvania	and i as i said i think we we have a a capital murder law on the books	0
user:do you|user:what|agent:um-hum right	i think another element in it in it is what kind of society do you	1
agent:and maybe try to re[habilitation]- rehabilitate|user:[noise]|agent:and uh	um-hum	1
user:like semiautomatics uh things like that should not be just given out to anybody in fact|user:i guess if i had to rate it from one to ten i guess i would rate it a five in the aspect that i wouldn't want everybody to have guns and i think there should be limitations of|user:[noise] okay um	you know i can't imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose	0
agent:um hunting rifles and probably handguns for people who use them_1 to|user:um-hum|agent:i definitely think that there some things shouldn't be limited like like you said rifles and	exactly for f[or]- self protection sure	1
agent:um-hum|user:things like that so they have may have some shotguns they may have other|agent:right	types of uh hunting type things but i figured if the if the criminals	0
agent:right|user:i guess i i was always taught number one a gun isn't a toy|user:um	um	0
agent:um-hum|user:the National Rifle uh Club|agent:right	and so we were taught	0
user:yeah|user:sure|agent:but and i knew we had the guns in the house and the the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time [noise] but we it was never my brothers and sisters nor i never i mean none of us ever thought well let's go look at the gun or let's go get the gun out it was just something you knew was there and the it was your father's and you you that was not something you'd go and play played with at all	yes	1
user:i tend to read the morning paper just because it's more|agent:right|user:out here in Rochester we i also get the morning paper here um we we're Gannett town so we have a morning and a afternoon paper both owned by Gannett	breaking news i also listen to short wave depending upon what the world conditions are like	1
user:you know i mean Iraq is bombed but no you're not going to see that today because|agent:um-hum|user:because i- i just despise fluff journalism	here's Janey age five on the front page blowing bubbles [laughter-you] [laughter-know]	1
user:who um who's been doing that program forever who comments on what life in America is like and uh|agent:[noise]|agent:[laughter]	most British seem more amused than anything [laughter-else]	1
user:um i i have a uh you know i- i found out about the service on Comp Dcom Telecom so we have access to|agent:you know computer network news services anything like that|agent:d[o]- do you use any electronic type news services like a	you know there's there's um Clara News and you can also get on CompuBucks and uh read	0
agent:wha[t]- what kind of benefit uh benefits do you have at work|user:go ahead [laughter]|agent:wha[t]- i'm sorry	well i- i'm i work at a large company and uh	0
user:wish uh in a big company there's more bureaucracy and|user:[noise] well one thing that i- i uh|agent:oh yeah is there a something that you wished you had that you don't or	uh less support of uh	0
user:um|agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh	we don't get paid very much but uh	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh|user:credit union CEOs and people like that	so she was really into the	0
user:that's uh|user:just i get what what you give in uh|user:yeah	not	0
user:i think um|agent:[noise]|user:um	uh actually i'm	0
user:um|agent:right|user:belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you [noise]	so	0
user:and then uh|user:[noise] right uh|agent:or maybe they don't [laughter]	um if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodontics will	1
agent:right|user:there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in uh Germany and Japan|user:and i r[eally]- i think it's really something that the uh the government ought to encourage more because uh	um	1
agent:for the women in the in the uh corporation for example uh [noise] oh|agent:lesser uh benefits perhaps for you but for|agent:uh what about what about uh	leave	1
agent:oh i think i think it's just a crying shame uh|user:get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks|user:uh i really think that we need to	[noise]	1
agent:right i agree|user:uh in exchange for a longer period of time|agent:um-hum	it's uh it's so important to families then and uh and yet anybody whose	0
agent:i just don't know how how women do it particularly single parents who don't have the support at the other end|agent:and uh|agent:uh they have a very very poor leave policy	right	0
agent:but one of the benefits we get of course is travel [laughter]|user:and uh [noise]|user:[noise] right	oh right	1
agent:uh what about you|user:really|agent:start out again and then it tapers off [laughter]	well yeah i do a lot of exercise right now i'm into {jazzercise} which i absolutely love	0
agent:but it|user:it is inside and i've been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having and i enjoy that much more too|agent:okay now that's inside again right	than inside	1
agent:it my subconscious is working on things while i'm working and i i go back and i've got new ideas but|agent:also that that|agent:uh	yeah	1
user:unless i could afford what i really like which would be a red Ferrari or you know|agent:ah|user:[noise] and i love it and i would get another one in a minute	a little Corvette or something like that	0
user:continue to live in my house [laughter-so]|agent:[laughter] yeah there there's something about having a place to live i don't know|user:and i wanted it but i had a choice of that or my house and i felt that i should	yeah you know it's just necessary and i did i thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but [noise] probably not practical	1
user:yeah i don't think that happens so|agent:yeah it's it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive|user:like driving a little sports car	but i- i love mine so and i- i bought it because i drove a friend's in Hawaii	0
user:and uh and so as as a result uh you know it's it's a trade-off you know for the common good you know for for the benefit of others|agent:right hm|agent:[noise]	you know how much of your resource should you dedicate to uh making things work for others	0
agent:right|user:[laughter] just you know just just con somebody to take care of me and the[n]- a[nd]- and then you don't have to be on the tax roll|agent:[noise] [laughter-right]	but uh but taxes are are very difficult	0
agent:against taxes as as everybody else you know most of them_1 [vocalized-noise] unless you work for Internal Revenue [laughter]|user:[noise]|agent:[laughter] uh well i th[ink]- i no i think that people that work for the government are just as	yeah i've blown yeah	1
user:but uh um n[ow]- the um the local taxes here i- i i[n]- in this particular area um|agent:right|user:it's not exactly that kind of a place that that that you wanna you know get into a tax revolt situation	you know i've uh i think i pay about uh oh	1
user:but uh there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer|user:or Seguin or someplace like that|agent:yeah	and i- and i think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer	0
agent:oh you|user:i think that people should be allowed to have them_1 especially_1 if they go hunting|agent:on	which my son goes hunting he goes deer hunting he goes duck hunting	1
user:well i agree with you on that because i know uh in fact i had bought my son a rifle like|agent:things like that you know uh|agent:like maybe waiting periods and	for a Christmas present one time	0
agent:um-hum|user:he's always had a like a i think his first little rifle we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old|agent:um-hum	but he's always he went to the to the school to learn how to shoot it he goes to the pistol range and uh	0
agent:you know he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that but i mean you know you're you know people make you know they forget or you|agent:and uh she said [vocalized-noise] that uh|user:um-hum	[noise]	1
agent:right yeah i know|agent:yeah you're|user:and since i do a lot of projects i throw things in the back and i kind of like having a pickup truck actually i think of it as a [noise] as a car that'll last [laughter]	i- i like the way trucks are built and i don't care about comfort so i'm pretty happy	1
agent:yeah|user:a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time i'm not sure|user:probably do with a	we have to we	0
agent:tow everything and it i can throw i've had eleven people in it [laughter-before]|agent:and uh it pretty much does everything i need it to i mean it it'll tow three thousand pounds so i can|user:um-hum	uh-huh	1
agent:which is actually the usually my preferred mode of transportation if i can take it and it's not raining|user:uh-huh|agent:a Kawasaki motorcycle	yeah	1
user:[noise]|agent:and i go out twice a week on the bike so|user:no	yeah -[i]t's like	0

agent:[noise] uh do you have children in school um|user:think about this	i do	1
agent:[laughter] and uh there is a do you have the standardized testing now|user:i know really what's the new criteria huh|agent:well how mature do you have to be [laughter]	[noise] we have all kinds of testing and it's over and over it's ITBS or	0
agent:right|user:we just kind of have everything here and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are|user:um	and so i don't know how much of it is us and how much of it is Texas but the kids are expected to excel in everything	0
agent:oh it is|user:and i just think it's really awful and i i'm with you on that you don't hear too many people say this but i think it's a very long day|user:for everything	and my feeling is that	0
agent:[noise] i'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch and then they have naps or rest period|agent:after lunch they have some uh|agent:well for example in my son's kindergarten they're really finished at lunch time	uh-huh	1
user:sending uh the local press here into a tizzy over|user:although this year we did have fifteen murders for the year|user:um by far um	what the mayor was going to do about all this stuff	1
user:uh did in i think twenty one prostitutes|user:who um|user:well we had up here um a serial killer named Art Shawcross	over uh	0
agent:yeah like ten twelve years ago this was this happened right|user:i remember hearing that too|agent:and some	[noise] w[e're]- we're lucky enough that we don't have to put up with the New York City shenanigans but	1
user:into some kind of community i don't know if that's|user:i don't know if you feel the same but uh when it comes to telling kids that they have to do uh two or three years of service|user:[noise]	uh appropriate for a government to suggest that and say you know you have to do two years of community service before you can	0
agent:uh mandatory|user:um-hum|agent:be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to	exactly	1
agent:um-hum|user:if they were you know the abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse|agent:right	or if uh they destroyed some property around the	0
user:and that's i think they have done that and judges have said well|user:strike out and do their crimes or whatever|user:effected when they	you know this is what you're gonna get for	0
agent:because_1 you like you say it's a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors|user:yeah|agent:the thing is that it's not enough of that kind of stuff going on uh	um-hum	1
agent:[noise]|user:[noise] capital punishment uh i guess out in California has has had a lot of uh a lot of you know discourse in the paper	uh apparently uh there's they haven't uh	0
user:uh appeal process|user:i think extend beyond the normal|user:uh you know the lawyers these lawyer groups get together and they uh they	uh you know and just drag these this guy uh his his uh ultimate uh demise out for ten or fifteen years	0
user:well [noise] the term technicality the the the law enforcement community|agent:and it's it's really getting out of [hanters/hand] in mo[st]- many states|agent:maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find	uh	0
user:e[rror]- error though be it not the right way to do it but but you know the the merits of the case in terms of|user:uh you know a a non a non critical|user:or whether there's just you know a policeman has just made a uh	you know the guy was a law breaker	0
user:um in in the old days you know and say|user:will pump the appeal process dry|user:uh and you know it didn't work but be that as it may everybody who got enough money	round about_1 times of Battle of Hastings you know and that vi[llages]- villages if you were a transgressor they they either you know drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody and he were you were his slave and if he didn't like what you did he killed you	1

user:fairly fortunate that i was able to do that and i did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in day care and i thought to myself how can a mother|user:in fact um i spent the first three years at home with my daughter so i- i guess i felt|user:i think so too	place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks	0
user:and really women past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too|agent:right|user:uh were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision well jeez you know i'll go out and get a part time job got a part time job and then financially they got themselves into well i'll have the boat i'll have the car and it's nice	uh because it is now our financial situations are as	0

agent:the flashy stuff you know the all the doors lock when you do something or uh|agent:some of the other things i like about well some of the things i don't like usually are um|agent:but uh	yeah	1
agent:um-hum|agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:well in Patterson there's it's not a problem here but like uh i lived in Oakland uh until just recently	and uh Oakland California God they've had like uh sixty seven murders so far this year compared to like uh	0
agent:more less that's done about it the more it seems it tends to spread even to smaller areas unfortunately|agent:you know the more it|user:um-hum	yeah [noise] well i i think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch	0

agent:to|user:[noise] for the|agent:oh i would too i would i would advise anyone that could possibly do it to	i know it's not forever and that's what's so sad but	1
user:and pipes and|user:you know are northern and|user:um preference wise to fish for the best if you're going to eat what you are going to catch is pan fish um i've caught	uh northern pipes and other walleyes and things like that and preferably to me the meat isn't that	0
user:and i'm sure someday i'll probably get back but uh at the current time|agent:um-hum|user:and that was kind of a very interesting uh experience that i had and i'm sure that part of me would like to go back and do that it's kind of like for trout fishing	the most	0
agent:salmon fishing up there and that was really uh|user:oh gosh yeah|agent:i had a chance to go to uh Alaska for six weeks last summer and did some	oh what an experience huh	1
user:but it seems like if you go fishing like in the middle of the summer when it's hot and humid|agent:um-hum|user:well i've also noticed i don't know the best time of the year for fishing uh in this area is right after the winter and the ice is been on and it's real cold water	uh the fish tastes [vocalized-noise] tastes fishy	0
agent:um-hum|user:there's a big difference in you know fishing too|user:um	which brings up another point point too as far as ice fishing that's uh way up here in the north here [laughter]	0
user:to root out the|agent:[noise]|user:a lot of companies now are are using uh drug testing uh paraphernalia and drug testing situations to	the either uh	1
user:uh|user:unless you really go into a deep background of course we're [vocalized-noise] being involved in my organization|user:that's difficult	we we have deep background checks and	0
agent:i i guess i'm probably a little more t[oward]- toward the other direction um|agent:um well i guess|user:what's your uh feeling	[laughter]	1
user:and the costs to society|agent:oh yeah well that's why there's you know why there's people dealing it because there's money in it you know there's a ridiculous amounts of money in it|user:yeah i i m[ust]- must admit that the the production costs of of these drugs are are {zippo} compared to the street market costs and the	yeah	0
agent:and power corrupts|agent:and|user:yeah i do too uh of	course	1
user:you know s[tuff]- oh stuff that happened many years ago in their lives i think that's|user:yeah really and then it seems like they bring out [vocalized-noise] all the dirt that they can bring out about a person|agent:[vocalized-noise] sell your soul it seems like to	awful	1
agent:for example he had a really good plan for the homeless|agent:and|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:four years [laughter]|user:yeah yeah he wasn't in office very long was he|agent:so we we get disgusted if it's not glitzy	you know	0
agent:oh God we certainly do|user:i mean Oakland seems like they have an awful lot of problems there|agent:i don't know and i don't know	you know have you lived there long	1
user:[noise] uh i don't know my personal perception of government and uh the way things are at this current time is that nobody can really be trusted	and i don't feel that	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:Thomas|user:i'm trying to think of his name and uh what they put uh him through in regards to yeah Thomas	the sex the sexual harassment that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that	0
user:i know that's my personal viewpoint of|user:so|user:uh that can get into government even if they were poor	things	1
user:passed|user:and of course they think uh Wisconsin our neigh[bor]- or Minnesota our neighbor|user:is thinking about oh we need to reform the health uh system	a state law the health bill	0
agent:and that is uh uh we become so debt ridden and credit oriented|user:uh-huh oh sure|agent:i think the one of the biggest problems that uh we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself	oh sure	1
agent:yeah we just had a|user:ex[actly]- yeah e[xactly]- exactly it's uh|user:i've done it but oh boy [laughter] and it's not going to get out	there's no secrets in the government	0
user:you know since we're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here|user:uh we really don't have too much of a problem as far as uh industry|user:we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution i think Grand Rapids was number one	but we do have the same problem a lot of are other areas up here in the northeast have and that is the effects of acid rain	0
user:uh you know Governor Mario going after you know governors of Ohio and and Indiana to fix|user:as this acid rain continues to fall and i know that there's been battles over the states up here|agent:right	what's going on down there i remember when i was in Florida the only problem was that it seemed like it may it wasn't really pollution just the steamy weather [laughter]	1
user:yeah|agent:a[ir]- air pollution i mean|agent:but i you know you['ve]- you've got you've got the industry you've got that and you got the cars and i think the cars are where where it's at right now as far as pollution goes	i you know Florida doesn't seem to be at least maybe Miami	0
user:it's you know it's under so much control you know sulphur dioxide is the big|user:but|user:the lenses for cameras and they they make film here and they're the worst offender	emittant from them but that's really getting under control now	1
user:[noise] you know but uh|agent:uh-huh|user:i'd be for it	you know i- i- i don't know it's just kind of a [noise]	0
agent:uh-huh|user:you know but i guess if they you know you know there's uh i i guess there's some companies that aren't [noise] that are doing it|agent:right	and it it seems to be working out so	1
user:and then i kind of hear it goes into like uh this is just|user:yeah|agent:where uh like a lot of people are saying well i only smoked a joint last night i don't have any problems [laughter-you] [laughter-know] or something like that yeah	something i've heard that it kind of goes into like uh just your off the counter medication that you could be taking for a cold that it kind of affects that too	1
agent:yeah it it hits me as the Orwell thing Big brother is [laughter-watching]|user:it's like wha[t's]- what's kind of next|agent:uh-huh	the what	1
agent:right|user:oh yeah but i- i- i just kind of think it's heading that way though you know it's just [noise] because it's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff and i just|agent:hopefully we won't [laughter]	i just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way	1
user:i'm not sure they know exactly what uh|user:i guess uh i think they've lost their compass and uh|user:uh	uh public education supposed to be for anymore	1
user:education the kids are getting|user:everybody cares about the|user:that's one thing	and um	0
user:and you can|user:pay attention and participate and|user:um	influence the way things are	1
user:school districts in places like|user:i guess my evidence for that is the|user:and	California for example where	0
user:the|user:i think that's a a loss of civic virtue and a loss of um [noise] uh|agent:right	cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids	0
user:everybody should have an education so that they'd be a better voter|agent:right|user:education for civic participation the idea was that	and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes	1
user:what their purpose is|user:i'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know|user:and um	and i'm really sad to say this i never thought i would have but i really think that uh	0
user:the hat|agent:oh you laugh how many what ages [laughter]|user:yeah [laughter]	well uh twenty seven up	1
agent:yeah|user:but i always uh just made it a point to you know try to spend about ten minutes with each one of them|user:when mine were growing up i did some traveling and but not that extensively	so it was an hour you know	1
user:yeah|agent:you know by the time i pick them up and get them home and get them fed i have very little time each evening maybe thirty minutes max|agent:but that's [vocalized-noise] well both my husband and i work and sometimes i feel like	well that's plenty though	1
agent:sure|agent:sure|user:and you know and as the kids got older i made them_1 you know help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too	or whatever and	1
agent:oh|user:that didn't agree with them_1 and we'd take turns being president|user:discuss everything	and everyone would get one's vote	0
agent:whatever was voted on huh|user:but if if they missed it they had to abide by the rules|user:never had to attend	yeah and boy they'd they'd show up	1
user:well|user:and your husband|agent:oh why is that	yeah my [vocalized-noise] my uh	1
agent:um-hum|user:three are married and they have little kids|user:so it's really my parents and i have five children	and so you know it's basically us	1
user:but we don't have lots of|user:uh it's really hard to get everyone together|user:he's a teacher and he had things he had to do and he couldn't just leave but	aunts and uncles and things like that	1
agent:you know kind of like camp ground things|user:uh-huh|agent:we've had them at resorts uh you know smaller resort places uh	but that way no one has all the work i mean once it's planned	1
agent:and then all of their kids and their kid's kids an[d]-|user:hum|agent:twelve of them_1 or fourteen of them_1 or something like that not all of them_1 are living still but there's probably eight or nine that still are	[noise] yeah i see	1
user:which are in Bayfield which is a wonderful place|agent:um-hum|user:well there's uh places in Wisconsin there's the Apostle Islands um	and then there's also uh what we found uh in the state of uh South Dakota the Black Hills	0
agent:two cousins and uh|user:uh-huh|agent:four kids my brother and myself and	sure	1
agent:oh my|user:yuppie type of camping because they have showers they have things for kids to do they have swimming pools things like that and you can find uh some really nice clean|user:uh there's lots of places if you're gonna go camping KOA's are wonderful it's kind [laughter-of] it's kind of the uh	uh campgrounds versus um if you go to a state parks	0
agent:[noise]	[noise] i'm Nevin from Sunnyvale California	1
user:no and e[ven]- even like you know|agent:and simple majority won't do|user:yep i	two thirds majority i mean [laughter]	1
agent:are you involved in the legal system at all|user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter-yeah] no doubt	no	1
agent:i don't know [laughter-yeah] i always think about watching the People's Court or something|agent:um it's kind of weird|user:[laughter]	[laughter]	1
agent:um|agent:and uh and and most of the time they're looking to place blame|user:you know that's a	yep [laughter]	1
agent:yeah that's true and in fact they're even letting some go|agent:yeah|user:yeah and if it's criminal cases we you can't put them_1 in jail because there's no room left	yeah	1
agent:uh computer programmer [laughter] unfortunately that can be done from the ground [laughter]|user:[laughter] what do you do now|agent:but uh that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately	oh	1
user:um|agent:uh-huh|user:plans to uh go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to uh the sixties	although i have a [noise] i- i kind of wonder [vocalized-noise]	0
agent:uh any particularly uh nasty environmental impact|agent:uh|agent:that doesn't require	exactly	1
agent:to get politician's votes instead of instead of f[or]- for you know we should eventually send someone people to Mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so|user:um-hum|agent:uh glitz and show factor	right	1
user:um|agent:i'm not sure there was the big one uh earlier in the week in uh California that o[n]- on and off and on and off [noise] um|agent:uh	in California yeah	1
user:it almost becomes more|agent:yeah|user:[noise] you know i understand you need to prove without a shadow of a doubt that the guilt and whatnot but the appeal process of it i think is what really bugs me if you're gonna make it go so long you know what's the use of it	more co[st]- you know to much cost and	0
agent:[noise] yeah that th[at]- that's i[t]- and uh that that [noise] i[t]- if it's gonna happen it seems like there there there's some sort of closure when it when it's over and done with i know that was one of that aspects that covered the sequel to the case in California was was both i[t]- this is the first one in twenty five years and they've got something like over three hundred [vocalized-noise] on death row but the other thing was whe[ther]- you know the family of the victims uh one of the fathers of the boys i think in California but you know wanted to be there to to witness it and it|user:you know fifteen years and i- i wonder about the families of the people who are the victims you know and they've got to be a little bit upset themselves and|user:and that's why you know like i say a part of my thing with the whole appeal process kind of bugs me because_1 here they have sat for	um-hum	1
user:[noise]|agent:[noise] well that's the that's the thing here in here i[n]- here in Texas we've had a couple of cases in the last [noise] one one was a was a murder case where it was|user:uh	um-hum	1
user:my parents are|user:you know my|agent:[noise]	not quite at that age yet so i haven't	0
agent:and uh|user:are sure they were|agent:i think the way they did things were a lot different back then	yeah	1
agent:it it is [laughter] it is expensive|user:and i'm sure it's it's expensive|agent:treat them_1 like that	yeah [noise]	0
agent:when she can't take care of herself|agent:uh-huh|user:in the future you know she she knows it's not gonna be like that all the time and she's just wondering well what's gonna happen to me and	and	0
agent:uh-huh|user:she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat so i'm assuming it's something like that too so|user:because i- i remember her in her letters telling me she	so	1
agent:um-hum|user:she has her own home and sh[e]- and she's doing really well i'm really proud of her she's doing really well|user:and she doesn't really need the care or anything like that but	so	1
agent:the death penalty i come from Florida|agent:well i originally come from a state that has uh|agent:i come from a state that has	uh-huh	1
agent:and it's really you know it's it gets to be a a rea[lly]- a big problem|user:um-hum|agent:there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build	yeah	1
agent:okay fantastic|user:um Audiology|agent:oh okay great what program you in	yeah what do you do	1
agent:um-hum|user:um they they don't get repealed as easily as they do|agent:yeah	like i[n]- the guy in California got	0
agent:[laughter]|user:uh well i'm in graduate school and so i read a lot of books but i don't know if i consider very many of them_1 good [laughter]|agent:how about_1 yourself	[laughter] um	1
user:the Salisbury area in in England|user:well it's s[ort]- sort of the his[torical]- the historical fiction about uh|user:uh it's the history of um	uh	0

agent:Max co[nsistently]- consistently writes good books|user:yeah|agent:Max Lucado	yeah	0
user:uh right now i'm in we're physicians health plan and that costs about thirty five bucks a paycheck|user:out of their paycheck for the same insurance that we're getting|user:uh i don't know why the post people post office people pay one third	but yet the postal people will only pay less than ten dollars a paycheck	1
user:[vocalized-noise] and afford fifty bucks every paycheck for a health insurance plan|user:and i'm sure there's a lot of people that live paycheck to paycheck to where they cannot|user:Saturday afternoon you're playing baseball and you break your arm you don't know what it's going to cost you for the x-rays and everything else like that if you don't have some type of health plan that you can afford	and i know i and when i was in Germany i was in the service but at the same time	0
agent:uh i do at times off and on right now i'm probably in one of the more the more off times|agent:[noise]|user:[noise] he uh well do you use a budget	any particular reason uh that you get off of it or does it seem to work for you	1
agent:was what was called the ten twenty seventy budget|agent:was the the budget i was on the most|user:pardon me	and	1
agent:you know we like buy our own house together or something|agent:and that'll probably it'll probably be that way till uh|agent:uh	uh-huh	1
agent:abso[lutely]-|user:or you know even if it's of course most of us are direct deposit anymore anyway i'm sure|user:which i think is really the easiest way to save because once you have the money in your hand in the check you'll think oh well i just won't put anything	but once it goes into the checking account it's awfully hard to transfer it over	1
user:okay_1|agent:[noise]	um	1
user:up to the people or|user:um|user:like um should it be that way or should it be	um	1
user:you can|user:yeah you can|agent:maybe you get a bad bunch or [laughter-what] [laughter-ever] and they uh	but it seems like when i[t's]- when it's trial by jury it's a little more detailed it's a little more slower	0
agent:yeah|user:oh really|agent:reducing a rape case without a firearm or without a weapon to uh just practically a misdemeanor	[noise]	1
user:and um|user:i don't know but then again i guess it takes up a lot of your taxpayers money and time|user:um	i don't know it's just	0
user:and that's real scary too you know i mean|user:and uh|user:they had something very similar to that	to to really think about it really is	1
user:[laughter]|agent:how do you mean|user:that's what comes to mind anyway	well i don't know i guess uh	0
agent:the consequences [laughter]|user:results of that in uh|user:um	a lot of problems yeah i mean i don't blame people for	0
agent:we were two income you know careers and all that|agent:and uh for the first eighteen years of our marriage um|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
user:it's difficult espec[ially]- it's not so much|agent:um-hum|user:until they were uh well into school	difficult financially i don't think	0
agent:difficulties are reflected in a lot of the unrest right now we're seeing with respect to politics|agent:and i think that uh you know our personal|agent:the way things haven't really changed	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:yeah|user:by your family [noise] and i don't i- i don't see a lot of support out there i see|user:do what's right by your	a lot of people um	1
agent:it it's it's a different perspective and uh you know we got caught up in that we we we had|user:um-hum right|agent:uh you know think they're poor if they can't get a Polo shirt every week [laughter]	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:for this type of work|agent:Sprint had uh two thousand jobs open i mean i'm sorry two hundred jobs open they had two thousand applications|agent:and you know they just i mean	uh-huh	1
agent:[laughter]|user:i'm not a spring chicken [laughter-myself] quite frankly|user:well i- i have my own beef about health insurance i uh	um i raised a family and	0
agent:well you've you've approached it|user:and they won't let us|user:to buy into it to pay ourselves just to get the lower rate that a group would have	yeah they don't let you do it	1
agent:and have you offered to come in and have you offered to come in and pay the whole premium|user:yeah yeah that's part of their salary|agent:oh they are	yeah	1
user:am in favor of it|user:i myself almost um|user:yeah i-	uh	1
agent:um well i'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon|user:where do you work|agent:yeah	oh okay	0
user:and that's that's something to be aware of|agent:yeah|user:the drug tests assure u[s]- they're accurate but there's always that margin of error	another thing is a lot of times	0
agent:right|user:the literature they give with you says yeah we do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for|user:types although	um i don't know what what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon	1
agent:before you start or before you even interview or|agent:before they|agent:uh th[ey]- they test you um	right	1
user:so uh it was one of those things where|user:did the drug testing thing after that|user:and then uh	you go through the the general battery of	0
user:uh|user:yeah that's a good question i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave|agent:one ch[ance]- one more chance or two more chances	if you fail	1
agent:and uh just interviewing with companies right now|user:oh okay great|user:okay	yeah that was the first time i'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening	0
user:uh i think|agent:okay|user:no no that's one thing they don't do is is drug testing while you're on the job	i think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it but they don't do it	1
user:you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up|user:and uh|agent:um-hum	you know but	1
user:but um as far as politics in the grander uh|agent:um-hum|user:familiar with the politics that involved with that and that being passed	part of it as if you want to look at uh election type	0
agent:a whole nonpolitical arena|agent:you know pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of|agent:and now it seems like both he and the incumbent President are	he might be a a one of those sure uh it it's kind of when you think back of the old politics where	0
user:so it makes the common person uh not to say that a common person couldn't run for government and do a a fabulous job because he's got people|agent:um-hum|user:the people that were going to be paying your way um	that are quite intelligent and	0
agent:um-hum|user:the a other things to get a bill passed|agent:um-hum	and sure you can veto uh veto it at the last minute but then	0
agent:these are all people who care|agent:[noise] and the care of course is is wonderful because|user:that's wonderful	um-hum	1
user:you know if she needs constant care is not going to be an option|user:unfortunately having her come live with us|user:um	and what do you do you know	1
user:uh to do something|user:well yes that's for certain my my mom lives in a small town also and i know you know the funds just aren't available|agent:and actually a great deal more money [laughter]	in a small town that you have	0
agent:in nursing homes|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:but is there some reason i wonder why we couldn't have some of these people involved	um-hum	1
user:okay well|agent:well you called here [laughter-so]|agent:[noise]	um	0
user:a a a lot of the funding has not been done by the government a lot of it has been done by|user:you know and and allocated towards the AIDS research i think that AIDS research has been|user:uh	private endowment	0
agent:confronting this head on with some factual advertising for items of condoms and things like that that|agent:not|agent:i think that it we need to spend a lot more on education and try and get over this thing that we have about	um-hum	1
agent:where they're trying to ignore the problem blah blah blah and of course they overreact when you say that the fact that it's just good medical safe practice you know don't expose yourself in the first place|agent:and these things have been spread around and i[mmediately]- immediately people think well abstinence okay here we have these religious zealots telling us|user:right	um-hum	1
agent:that's true that's true|agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum	i do you know [noise] they make jokes about women picking out the color but i really do like to have a decent [laughter-sized] [laughter-engine] in my car	0
agent:um well i'm in ROTC so i'll be in the Army so on active duty so|user:are are you working yet|agent:so	uh-huh	1
user:but i i and i'm don't rarely listen to the um|user:of a paper reader or|user:we only get the paper on the weekends and so i'm not much of a	radio so it	0
agent:and does a pretty good job of analysis as well usually|user:um|agent:the national and international news i feel	are you in the car quite a bit or	1
user:uh the explosions and that kind of thing my husband will say how'd you know about that and i said yes it happened at such and such time and that's so that that's different for me|agent:um-hum|user:an[d]- and i've just recently decided to home with my children and so [laughter-it] seems as if i catch the news [rise/right] right as it ha[ppens]- happens you know there was	so i usually find out wh[en]- exactly when it happens and that kind of thing	1
agent:yeah|user:that kind of thing|agent:um-hum	so	0
agent:yeah that's what wh[at]-|agent:uh-huh yes|user:um it seems like ten o'clock at night [laughter]	unfortunately but that's that's what it seems like ten o'clock at night	1
agent:i suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that|user:sure|agent:so	well that's good because_1 sometimes i wonder you know being a uh	0
user:toward taking care of the environment that we have here|user:to me i would like to see a lot more money being put|user:to look at other than here so it's kind of like	and	0
user:you know and that|user:you know who would have cared about earth it would have been another planet to kind of take over and uh continue on so|user:if we would have went into space and found Mars a livable pl[anet]- uh planet we probably would have inhabited it and uh	when i look at the space program itself i think of it you know as being in terms of	0
agent:actually be a good compromise between you know deep [splace/space] i'm sorry deep space exploration|agent:and as far as the practical aspects go i suspect that the space station may|agent:well um	um-hum	1
user:desert part of it and then they have an area that's more um you know full of|user:you know an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the|user:there's uh you know they're trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create	uh vegetation tropicals that kind of thing to kind of uh	0
agent:[noise]	i think that the middle east is of all the uh regions of the world the most volatile that we seem to be getting ourselves involved in	1
agent:which is|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:you know clearly by the fact of the resources that are controlled by the region	oh clearly yes and um	1
user:and i- i think that the Palestinian question is a key to a lot of problems in the region|agent:yeah|user:a very powerful Israeli lobby in this country	and i don't think that this country's handled that well at all	1
agent:hum|user:uh i think that's up the stage for the end effect to for this uh|user:in the past	uh revolution of Islamic fundamentalism what seems to be sweeping	0
agent:um-hum|user:i suspect that we'll probably in uh with the demise of the Soviet Union formation of Russia whatever ends up coming out of that|agent:you know so you might as well not even try	that probably	0
agent:um-hum|user:and uh now we have problems with Sudan|user:but uh i you know Tunisia	and uh these places i think that you know we're just in the beginning here of uh what will probably sweep through i mean Egypt's suffering the same kinds of problems with fundamentalism right now	0
agent:so strong as in say talking about like Saudi|agent:the differences aren't so|agent:the uh	[vocalized-noise]	1
user:well Sears is kind of famous for taking back almost anything they're very good about it|agent:yeah|user:just recently had an experience with uh Sears uh do you have that down in Florida	i had bought a leather jacket almost about twelve years ago for my ex-husband	0
user:and i hadn't really hang on to receipts or anything|user:you know i really expect you to do something about this|user:eight months out of a winter coat all the stitches were coming out it's a real mess	and it it took much song and dance	0
user:it worked out nicely fortunately and|user:but um i was very please and and it is true i uh you know generally they back up what they have and|agent:yeah	it's you know it's like you know when someone else hits your car it's not your fault and you don't pay for it but you're majorly inconvenienced	0
agent:tells you when to bring it back in to to for repairs|user:huh|agent:a little black box that	[laughter-well] [laughter] it was some kind of part where you can't even an electrical spark off the engine anymore it just the whole thing just dies when you this thing goes	0
agent:really poor i feel|agent:our public schools are are|agent:well	uh-huh	1
user:and|user:when she was there|user:actually has two boys now but only had one	she complained quite a bit about this school system there	0
agent:i have a son that is in the fourth grade|agent:well i feel that we're way behind uh|user:and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad um just terrible	hm	1
agent:Hispanics|agent:we have a lot of uh|agent:uh also i think	there you go uh-huh	1
agent:and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done|agent:uh|user:that's right you can't do that	right	1
user:yeah|agent:my son would be in private school we just cannot afford it|agent:if we could afford it	right i was gonna ask you if there that was an option	1
agent:uh-huh|user:it really it there's not a whole lot there really isn't uh|agent:how do you uh how uh is recycling done in your community is	i know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio each	1
user:but i heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee|agent:so|user:uh-huh	to do that	0
user:yeah|agent:plastic goods they have this little number now that tells what kind of plastic it is|agent:have you noticed that on the bottom of	no	1
user:where what she does but she's uh oh she's|user:she lives in Garland and i'm not sure|agent:where does your friend go to recycle	ve[ry]- very heavy in that and she takes her own bags to the grocery store	0
user:uh|agent:uh-huh|user:you know the little um i don't know if you know the little character Barney they had one	on	0
agent:right|user:i don't think that they could be objective in every case every time|user:rather than to have one person be responsible	y[ou]- you know what i mean	1
user:there's uh no question it's beyond a reasonable doubt|agent:right|user:you know point blank in the crime	you all these things i mean you know we've gone through this uh over and over again	1
user:uh crimes that they|user:in in that regard i mean you know people who commit|agent:or or at least speeds them_1 up	i don't know how it works exactly but	0
user:and um|user:like drunk drivers that kill people|user:i- i think they should i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever	you know all	0
user:uh-huh|user:i know that the [vocalized-noise]|agent:that was absurd [laughter] there was no there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence	an[d]- i don't know uh wha[t]- what would you do to change it to make it better	1
agent:right|user:in other words you're saying that we you have to find out whether it's premeditated or|agent:well i mean were there witnesses	what the circumstances were	1
user:you get to know what's going on and maybe that's that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do|user:is to be in a situation where you|user:in uh in dealing in a with a large company	what's what's your feeling about benefits what sort of benefits would you like to get from a big compa[ny]-	1
user:that we should know|user:but uh but basically uh there's lots of things that|user:for good reason	about projects i'm an engineer	0
agent:yeah that is interesting|user:and bu[t]-|user:which i thought was kind of interesting	but uh but that sort sort of thing but but i[f]- but ju[st]- i think you can tolerate a lot of problems	0
user:most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and|user:but but regard to benefits you know most companies have|user:or if your management doesn't think that	that sort of thing	1
user:as you climb up that tree|user:and uh it's very much like the military it windows out you know you you think well boy i'm getting more money and i'm getting more responsibility i'm doing this but|user:uh as they get older to to most companies	pretty soon you're	0
agent:ones that they've negotiated with|agent:uh [noise] same deal as the doctors that they will pay a higher percentage and pay more of the costs with if you use their particular|agent:network hospitals where they will	um-hum	1
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:so you know for someone who's in a huge union like uh the you know all state employees it it you know	kind of the issue is kind of moot but i look at my parents my father's um self employed he's an attorney	0
agent:my employer doesn't pay them_1|agent:w[hat]- what uh|agent:end up making up	um-hum	1
user:and getting behind|user:is that i you know i'm only twenty four twenty five right just turned twenty five and ten years ago i can remember when it was not common to see two people in a family or household working|user:the biggest social change that i've seen in the last ten years	and uh running into	0
agent:uh so uh maybe that's just a different viewpoint uh but uh i just remember everything well just writing a letter fo[r]- for work you know i mean in word processor you know we can [vocalized-noise] to me i can't even image now how they even produced books or letters before word processors you know then we'd have to through fifty iterations at least the way i write letters and things|user:yeah|agent:and it was actually quite and art form to see some of the you know older or or more experienced cashiers go you know fly through that is like those Japanese hippies see what the abacus is still	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:of uh two income households that uh you never really saw before although i probably on the exception of that my both my parents did work but most of my friends parents when i was growing up|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:well we're getting greedy i guess but uh well with regarding to your comment i- i have to agree with that too there's a prevalence of uh	hum	1
user:not after AT&T's going to let go fifty thousand people i i'm uh constantly putting stuff up in [vocalized-noise] telecom|user:um-hum|agent:you're set for life [laughter]	from the CWA	0
user:wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to y[ou]- to tell them_1 you know that you're not interested or you do tell them_1 you're not interested and they still|user:uh someone calls and|user:when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or or whatnot and you know next thing you know	keep asking you you know and	0
user:uh-huh|agent:and uh while i was subscribing to the paper i got so upset at them that they you call me one more time i'm going to stop [laughter-subscribing]|user:[laughter]	[laughter]	1
user:um|agent:um-hum|user:um and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number	and and i've i've heard recently that uh	0
agent:Tel[ecredit]- what is it it's [Telecreder/Telecredit] something|agent:that she's not uh blacklist on uh|agent:i'd be real concerned that they uh	yeah	1
user:what|agent:every now and then you know as|agent:send some	well needless to say Texas is uh probably the leader	1
agent:an excuse by any means you know|agent:i don't i don't believe it's uh|user:um-hum	well i had heard of a case out in California	0
agent:uh so there's i think it i think it works since most people don't believe in being forced you know|user:[laughter]|agent:crime goes down [laughter] you y[ou]- you know	well i s[ay]- they may say it's not a deterrent and perhaps it isn't but i guess	1
user:uh every time you look in a friend's houses and they show you their computers and all the knickknacks they have it seems like they go from their basic computer to|user:i personally don't own one because i can't afford one|user:uh pressing in personal identification numbers all the ATM machines things like that	all these peripheral devices like uh modems and	0
user:use their VI editor and we use um read on line news through it|agent:yeah|user:and use the Unix operating systems	and we also have terminal emulations through IBM thirty two seventy eight	1
agent:[laughter] that uh that's a powerful force [laughter] once you that's a powerful force once you learn something you you tend to wanna stick with it|user:i think i think most of our users like Bourne shell because_1 they were trained in it and they just don't wanna learn something different|agent:um-hum	pardon	1
user:yeah|agent:that the family the definition of family is changing a lot|agent:um	oh yeah no doubt about it the nuclear family and just the whole downsizing approach	0
agent:that's probably a pretty [laughter-liberal] view but i mean to me the|agent:i don't know i guess that that's|agent:to me um	[laughter]	1
agent:their lives rather than one person dependent on another person seems to me|agent:who are sharing|agent:and two independent people	um-hum	1
agent:exactly|user:just the pragmatic side of it in terms of how can you afford to raise however many kids one or nine|user:you know regardless of the of the social impact or the the familial impact you got to think about	um with one income and it's never going to work i don't think	0
agent:right|user:they've got working parents both of them and it's like they're always shuffling them_1 off to day care|user:exactly you know that's something my sister's having to face right now they've both got	and you've got to ask yourself whose morals and whose values are being you know enforced on my kid [laughter]	0
agent:so i'm not sure how much i'm getting back but i'm pretty sure should get back a little bit since i'm still a student so|user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:yeah and and like as as time goes on you know things get more expensive and because we're [vocalized-noise] we're increasingly complex society that day by day things get more um things get more expensive as well as more complex|user:you know that that's a scary part too that you have to think about|user:so	[noise]	1
user:one of those things where um|user:there's gonna be a special this week i i can't i can't remember if it's Twenty Twenty or|user:you know the taxpayers are your m[oney]- is your money going to where you want it to go and	i think it's one of the local news i think they're having an a documentary something about that about	0
agent:it's it's the price they pay [laughter]|agent:it's good but|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:yeah|user:yeah|agent:to get you know i like to know where it's going to	that's true	1
user:is to first of all put an end to|user:well my basic idea on dealing with the US budget as unrealistic and [laughter] as it may be|agent:[noise]	these kinds of uh hidden user fees and uh	1
user:i- i just keep seeing unfortunately the p[roblem]- a lot of the problem why we have this deficits balloon especially during the eighties is just because the American people|user:[laughter]|agent:and we've only got you know we only took in two hundred million dollars uh i realize that i'm off by a factor of about five but [laughter] we only took in two hundred million even though this year is going better we can still only spend two hundred million	bought into this notion that well we can just uh we don't need a higher taxes certainly not they get enough of our money already and	0
agent:yeah|user:the legislatures are opposing parties are controlled by opposing parties which means basically every year we have a scream and terrified over the budget|agent:[laughter]	in this state which is delayed eternally and then they want to kill each other you know [laughter]	1
agent:have the garbage police looking after you i guess|user:i've heard of communities where you have to separate your garbage and then put what's left in a clear plastic [ga/bag] bag so they can kind of look and see if you're throwing out what [laughter-you] [laughter-shouldn't] i thought that was [laughter-pretty] [laughter-amusing]|user:and then the rest you can ju[st]- you throw out and the town picks it up	i imagine i don't know	1
agent:is that a city or state law that uh requires it to be recycled or|user:to get you know couple of mo[ney]- uh bucks for beer or [laughter-something]|user:and you find these old old men and these bag people collecting all these things and hauling them in in big garbage bags and they just like take up one of these machines to	yeah it's a state well New York state does it and i know Vermont a lot of the eastern states do it	1
agent:i it's on in my office and i can i can hear it as i'm working when i'm here [vocalized-noise] my commute is is about fifteen minutes|user:[laughter]|agent:w[ell]- well	[noise] oh okay	1
agent:uh|agent:by by not pub[lishing]- subscribing to the magazines anymore but uh|user:[laughter]	[laughter]	0
user:and i'll listen to [vocalized-noise] news on the radio but just in the car radio going to and from work in between|user:to get it uh|user:maybe on the weekend but during the week i just really don't have the time in the morning	music	1
agent:uh stamps and all that kind of junk in to go hang in the kitchen|user:right|agent:mail stuff you know the	well that's cool	1
user:uh yeah it is and i really haven't had time to do much with it|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:sounds like a big project	um it's a nice piano but it's just uh	0
user:sure|agent:had to have some kind of piddling to do all the time|agent:um so we're just and i just kind of	is that what you consider a hobby then for you	1
user:and uh|agent:uh-huh|user:and so i- i helped him do some of that	and like that but aside from that i'm a i'm a student at the University of Central Florida	0
user:and some of the stuff uh you could see the techniques that he used to reinforce uh the braces and things like that|user:and he'd made her bed and i was actually taking a look at it|agent:um-hum	they're really pretty ingenious and [vocalized-noise]	0
agent:uh the Washington DC area|user:where do you where do you live again|agent:yeah	okay so i'm thinking that's primarily pine trees for the most part in that area	1
user:that had some work that had to be done with it some of the|user:and uh|user:a duplex in Orlando	the door frames and things	1
user:there're|user:um|user:i- i jus[t]- i i'm probably one that has to agree with it too	a[re]- some things that go on that i just feel that	1
user:capital punishment needs to stay within the system|agent:yeah|user:well maybe that's something that needs to be worked on but i i just feel that that	not all states have them but i	1
agent:you know it was it was the best defense they could come up with|user:yeah|agent:um and he knew what he was doing and everything else i mean	and how long had he been	0
user:you know|agent:yeah|user:it's not used that often	at least here in Texas but	1
agent:[noise] um-hum|user:my sister and i were wondering about this recently because a an old friend of ours in California this jus[t]- happened about a week ago|agent:that's not real it doesn't have any real impact on them	um	1
agent:brutal types of things usually where it's multiple you know|agent:you know from what i understand it's it's only the most|agent:largely depends on the circumstances and generally	i think you're right	1
agent:uh-huh|user:mostly a mistake|user:looking back on it i tend to think it was pretty uh	on the other hand	1
agent:and i was glad it was over by then|user:yeah|agent:ended up being i was in the last last lottery	right	1
user:in World War Two the personalties of Stalin Hitler and Churchill|user:in the course of talking to him about it how uh|user:and i was thinking	more or less defined the war and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was uh	0
user:[noise] looking back it seems like that was only|agent:um-hum|user:otherwise there'd be uh they'd get you someplace else	partly true that uh	0
user:and i have a feeling that that's|user:just in order to um call the bully out and beat him|user:i don't think you can just fight anywhere just	part of what was involved in the	0
user:where|user:a hopeless situation|user:really get into a	and as you say	0
agent:and it was a it was a traditional|agent:you knew who was good you knew who was bad|user:yeah	yeah	1
user:as opposed to|user:and that tradition is still i mean it's dying now but it's still alive|agent:yeah	this Desert Storm stuff may have	0
user:but many times uh you know the the local uh local news kind of suffers you know|user:uh|agent:um-hum	but here i am you know cheek by jowl with our nation's capital	0
agent:several sources probably pretty high up on the list is National Public Radio|agent:yeah a lot of my information comes from|user:you know dose of news that way	um-hum	1
user:and|agent:oh i never saw that that would have been interesting|user:and and occasionally C-SPAN i- i like i- i saw the uh the uh the the tapes that were that were run of Marion Berry's drug bust was you know the whole thing was was run on that	and a[nd]- you know so they have the uh the uh uh Parliament's Question Answer Period	0
agent:[noise] what do you think|user:[noise]	well i think AIDS research should be funded more than it's currently being funded i think that	0
user:you know AIDS is is something that has to be dealt with by every person|user:that again that uh|agent:yeah	um	0
agent:um cancer and with mononucleosis and all the all the various diseases that affect the T cell from a|agent:but it also uh has a lot to deal with|agent:good in and of it's own	um-hum	1
agent:went to a dentist in Stewart Florida that's where she got it|user:right|agent:uh and died from it she	right	1
agent:um|agent:um asides from telling his patients that he had AIDS|agent:the proper precautions	um-hum	1
user:uh during my college years my mom worked for the state and she got me a summer job|agent:right|user:once they get them they're entitled to them for life and they can kind of take it easy because they're protected by their unions etcetera	and when i came in i'm i was just a little eager beaver and i went through whatever work they gave me	0
user:that th[is]- this i thought was totally outrageous that they have teaching assistants well that's that's an old thing you know having graduate students teach undergrads|agent:right|agent:[noise] yeah	but some of these people are you know from India and Asia and they don't speak English well enough for the students to understand now how could they possibly have someone teaching a class who is not fluent	1
user:bills that come in|user:and and and and my my wife you know you know looks at all those|user:[laughter] and and	and you know and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them	0
agent:and not ever have to spend any money on interest|user:um-hum|agent:and my intent was that whenever something went on sale that i really had to have i would have the cash to buy it right then and there	well that's that's good	1
agent:but it's the fact that i have enough of a of a cushion in the bank so that when they come i can pay them in full|agent:yeah i do almost all my purchasing on credit cards|user:yeah so we never really get that much over uh over extended	hm	1
user:but [laughter-un[fortunately]-] but unfortunately my my my wife Leigh feels as though it's it's just been an inappropriate uh|agent:[laughter]|user:the the the terrible part about it i've looked at it all and it all looks still pretty good to me why [laughter-why] do we need to replace it but	thing to to i mean that rug is thirteen years old why not replace it i mean	0
user:you know too many obligations to you know we sort of take care of the kids when they were in school and they they got through school and|user:have had uh|user:we we just sort of	that was the major you know decade of expenses you know	1
agent:break down of the family unit for one thing|agent:i guess|agent:yeah [noise]	um-hum	1
user:you know|agent:unbelievable|user:you know trying to kill others kids and	i[t's]- it's it's outrageous you know	0
user:yeah because_1 that's cheap and incredibly addictive|agent:yeah|user:i don't think there was much of a problem until crack started hitting the streets really	and uh	1
user:but doesn't uh help the home mechanic that much unless they've got a uh you|user:yeah yeah|agent:i do have a lot a lot help with those com[puters]- you know the curves giving a lot of information diagnostic	know some way to decode all that information	1
user:yeah i-|agent:fulfilling the role it used to|agent:family isn't	i think that's probably the key thing you know the key thing so you've got	1
agent:[laughter]|user:who they gets defined by what kind of tennis shoes they wear|user:you know	and uh	0
user:or communist regime is God awful and uh|user:a left wing regime|user:how we treat them countries down there for example	basically uh you know Satan incarnate	0
agent:yeah|user:yeah yeah it's like Guate[mala]- how many Guatemalan and El Salvador refugees have we|agent:we wouldn't let them_1 in	seen and heard about in the last ten years	0
agent:we go in and bomb his country and uh|agent:a[nd]- and then suddenly|agent:Noriega for years	[laughter]	1
agent:united fruit then that's fine|agent:the|agent:uh	yep	1
agent:but you listen to the what the Armenians have to say about their neighbors the Azerbaijanis and they launch in a second if they had an access to those weapons|agent:that these people aren't nuts|agent:i you know in a sense you'd think being a you know an American or a westerner it would make sense that w[e]- there is no real great threat	right	1
user:right|agent:and uh i think that's where they are headed|agent:they could become another Korea or Malaysia or Thailand type of [vocalized-noise] source for cheap labor where American products could be built	well i think that that there's a uh qualitative difference that uh Russia and and much of the Soviet Union	0
user:you know uh relationships between the states to to shape so i agree with you know they're they need another couple years to to let them uh settle down|user:you know they're not sure who they want their leaders to be they're not sure how they want the|user:we're we're still going through a a uh you know a settling period	and uh start cooperating	1
user:i usually uh|user:it's pretty casual uh|user:uh it's	usually wear something like jeans sneakers	1
user:wearing your|user:you don't really want to be|user:but some of it's a little bit dirty you know you got all this machinery and stuff so	best stuff for that	1
agent:yeah|user:so let's see wh[ere]- where did you you said you're in Houston|user:yeah	so you don't have to dress very warmly i suppose	1
user:which thing [laughter]|agent:[laughter]|agent:thing out in LA	they've got more than one	1
user:you think it was a good|user:you think he was uh|user:and what do you think about it	verdict or	1
user:the story|user:you know a small part of the|user:only saw	that is that what you're uh seeing on the TV now or	1
user:child care places are are coming under uh|user:but but but th[e]- when i really am uh am concerned about is that uh so many of these|agent:[laughter]	uh	0
agent:very secure well raised children my comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune [laughter]|agent:my kids i think are very|agent:i'm really not defensive about it i personally feel um in our particular situation i'm a much better mother when i work out of the home and	hm	1
agent:but|agent:a little bit extra|agent:but it was good i mean it was it w[as]- at that time there were two children and they were in special programs and each one was a little over two hundred a week and then in addition i paid	well	1
agent:[noise]	[noise]	0

agent:um-hum|user:a truck and and in the background everything's in flames|user:uh you know the cover photo is	and i think they kind of uh set you up in a way	1
agent:this one person|agent:um-hum|user:you know and they don't tell you that that makes you so angry to think that oh they beat on this poor man	but he he had a choice to you know this all could have been	0
user:well uh [noise]|user:[noise] [vocalized-noise]|agent:[noise] okay well um i'll let you start i guess	yeah i'm i'm employed by a company that does do uh	1
agent:uh in that regard where there's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property|agent:necessary|agent:but where it's not	yeah	1
user:government contractor|user:because they're a uh|user:[noise] it's it seems to me that it's still should i o[ur]- our company's doing it	[laughter] uh and so it's it's required for	0
user:pick out the people that that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage|user:uh|user:we don't we don't have enough courage to	uh because_1 that would offend them uh if they if they weren't so we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and make it all even	0
user:uh|user:uh you know i i sit at a terminal and and write software all day it it|user:and	certainly [laughter-ha[s]-] has	0
user:that|user:that that i that i will give credit to to our our company for in that|user:yeah i	[vocalized-noise] i think there's there's a	0

agent:yeah|user:yet other brand names you know Panasonic and that that little that i can drop on the floor and they still work|user:die very quickly	it you you really these days because we don't everything's been deregulated we don't seem to care as much about consumer protection	0
agent:when when Walkman's first came out|agent:yeah it's it's true that's happened to me i'm i mean i've gone uh|user:and then you're you're if you're not informed as a consumer you end up with absolute junk	[noise]	1
agent:right|agent:you know [noise]|user:oh yeah the the worst value is because if something goes wrong it's generally in the first thirty or sixty days that you own it	oh they do that on VCR and it's high pressure	1
agent:[laughter]|agent:so|user:my wife wishes i hadn't done that	[laughter]	1
agent:twenty two inch piers something like that|user:did|agent:uh-huh it's on about uh	you had those poured or you did them_1 yourself	1

user:[noise]|user:most|agent:[laughter] yeah that that it probably does i i don['t]- not sure but	when i drive through that area that's all i see is	1
user:uh with regard to uh to jury trials i you know i- i really feel as though uh jury trials are are uh whatever system has been been used historically in|user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	particular jurisdiction	0
user:he you know|user:you know Rodney got beat up because he|agent:no	he pur[poses]- you know he involved himself in some sub self-destructive behavior	0
user:hey the bu[nch]- the average person is gonna take a look at that and say|user:well e[verybody's]- everybody's saying this is gonna be a new era we're gonna reexamine this thing|agent:we all saw the same thing on the on the tape and um	suspicions confirmed	0
agent:oh|user:right i'm inside the beltway|agent:the bigger cities probably than we are in Idaho here	you know how capital gang they always say well inside the beltway they think thus and so and i say well wait a minute i'm inside the beltway and i don't think like that	1
user:that's that's why uh|user:and so|agent:oh i see	uh tha[t's]- that's why i'm religiously getting on the phone because i have a unique	0
agent:i also pull from that and from mine if we need the money you know if you need it for something or like you said the something comes up on the house and you've got to have it well you go deplete those funds [laughter-and] [laughter-use] [laughter-it]|agent:uh but|agent:and um and i use that for their uh life insurance investments	right	0
user:in this country and i've come to learn that a lot of these politicians unless you can mobilize enough consumers|agent:uh-huh|user:from the cable TV industry	or voters to make a stink about an issue if there's a big pack check involved they'll take the check every single time	1
agent:i mean the whole thing almost fell apart|agent:and it was a terrible a terrible situation|user:um-hum	[laughter]	1
user:White House strongly against it|user:because_1 we had a Republican Senator uh John Danforth who is strongly in support of it but then you had the|user:not doing the appropriate thing that that came down with the cable issue	because it would reregulate to an extent	1
user:you would have to really demonstrate to people that there is some legitimate reason|user:so i guess if we were to go about making the change|user:the metric system and i think the reason it failed last time is that most people really just didn't see any real benefit in changing	to make the change that would directly benefit them otherwise we're never going to really see any change	1
user:and a lot of the products and services that they were either dealing with or receiving on their end were really equipped for|agent:right|user:uh even though they try to get you to use the Celsius system it it went a little easier because Canada is so influenced by Britain	the metric system	0
agent:w[as]- and see you have things in odd measurements that's even true like for film and like you know sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter film|agent:so something before was you know|user:yeah	um-hum	1
agent:what about New York|user:huh [noise]|agent:i feel decidedly un[easy]- uneasy about it	well in New Yo[rk]- i'm not quite sure but what sounds familiar to me is that [noise] i[t's]- it's not legal except in cases of murder of police officers	0
agent:that's my understanding of it uh but that uh murder is something that you do intentionally|agent:uh-huh|user:that kind of thing	uh-huh	1
user:but i- i think the reason we don't go for it is because|agent:or|user:that this person actually murdered someone	we're afraid that we might be making a mistake and you can't fix it	1
agent:[noise]	[noise]	1
user:a little bit ambivalent the problem with uh|user:well i'm|agent:so how do you feel	and i think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it	0
user:i believe there are two policies that uh|user:um|user:[noise] i mean right now	that the government uses to modulate immigration	0
user:they um|user:at the bottom end|user:and so they can almost always find room for someone like that	are always willing to um let in cheap labor	0
user:they cannot close off the Mexican border not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would be uh|user:[noise]|user:uh letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico	uh would spill over to this country so they keep allowing	1
user:and uh places for|user:group to find jobs and uh|user:um	and so um	1
agent:it's just as well [laughter] you know it's hardly America anymore|agent:well i mean and the two of them_1 together i mean we can|user:now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans uh twenty years ago	on the other hand you know i[t]-	0
EMPTY	uh i-	0

user:no|agent:uh now you know they never really have had democracy there in any sense so|user:[laughter]	no	1
user:nuclear|user:despite the fact that they do have uh [vocalized-noise] you know probably a large uh substantial|user:maybe for the maybe for the simple reason that um	capability	0
agent:strong local national sentiments because_1 they aren't all Russians you know they're a lot of enclaves they have other nationalities|agent:may have uh|agent:uh those in Russia may be some of them in areas that uh	yeah sure	1
agent:they'll probably come out of it okay|agent:um|user:yeah	um-hum	1
user:do you worry that we might uh overs[tep]- [vocalized-noise] i guess my question is do you do you think that|user:um-hum|agent:most places as i understand it	there are ways that we might over[step]- overstep our bounds and provoke uh	1
user:i think one of the um|user:but my husband does and um|agent:[laughter] [laughter-right]	my first of all always salary and second the second thing	0

user:um|agent:yeah|user:worked out really well for us too	well is there anything else that you look for or	1
user:we have a program where uh we|agent:[noise]|user:[noise] uh around here	we put out the	0
user:you know they got i mean there there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that|agent:uh|user:my you've got a lot a lot of nothing out there	nobody gives a doggone about that you can	0
user:i- i think it should be i[t]- it should go to the to the heart of the matter though and say|user:well that certainly uh you know uh getting into the swim of things|agent:[laughter]	okay guy y[ou]- y[ou]- everybody gets you know five pounds of garbage that they can throw away	0
user:it looks like um|user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	we're going to have um	0
user:maybe it's always true of third party movements but this one seems to be almost entirely negative|user:what i see behind it this this this uh|user:i guess the	almost completely a reaction to uh	0
agent:yeah|user:i'm a CEO i know how to tell people to do things and get them_1 done|user:since most people agree on what needs to be done but nobody can figure out how to do it he's just going to say uh	which is uh pretty attractive and	0
user:um|user:ten or fifteen years where|user:it's it's a reaction to what's what's happened over the last	the	0
user:and now things are are so stalled|agent:yeah|user:where things should go	that uh	1
user:as just a um|user:i don't know those of us who weren't too happy with the Reagan years saw that as a|user:uh	[vocalized-noise] of selfishness	1
user:yeah|agent:[vocalized-noise] know some some somebody got to look down the road a ways and say well what's going to go on|user:what	what i see is all tactics and no strategy	0
agent:how you think how you feel|agent:and things like that too you know so|agent:straight and with it to do a good job and protect yourself and	well well i'm kind of ambivalent also y[ou]- like you say it it does affect your privacy um	0
agent:right|user:under no circumstances would i think that you could just go take a job and they could say hey guess what you know we're [laughter-gonna] do this|user:and where your actions could affect somebody's life i'd be much more accepting of drug testing but	i- i think it has to be up front and then you've got the choice of not doing it	1
agent:right|user:and part of it was a test for drugs nobody asked me you know they didn't mention what they were doing but it was perfectly obvious and i you know all government people and all army people are just tested|user:and part of the um you know you take this test i did very well and they called me in for a physical	and there was one fellow who just kept horsing around he he seemed almost	0

agent:[laughter]|agent:right|agent:um-hum	and i just got into the w[e]- FidoNet's now has a thing where we can get in with the internet	0
user:computers but i think the reason why it didn't work the first time is that they assumed that everybody would need a computer|agent:um-hum|user:well i see the phone companies are working on getting into information services so we're going to have a glut of things everyone i think we're going to see another revolution in	to do all these things	0
agent:yeah|user:[laughter-because] of the uh because they've stomped on us|agent:[laughter]	and so now what's happening is the phone companies want to get into cable and introduce all these kinds of computer services over fiber optics	0
agent:eighty five CRX|agent:well i have a i have a nineteen eighty f[ive]- uh|agent:uh	oh [noise]	1

user:[noise] what's your view on|agent:that uh seems to be why he's so popular i guess|agent:in either party	big political issues	1
user:it and i[t]- it usually you know it's a big deal until|agent:right|user:the whole the whole shebang about throw the bums out	election day comes around and then it you know it fizzles out and we end up with the same people	1
agent:exactly|user:uh feeling|user:for me that's not a going to be a wonderful	but uh	1
agent:i like the idea of volun[tary]- voluntary support i mean they might be able to ah say that anyone who does that uh gets certain benefits that [noise] would not be available to someone who didn't do it|agent:well [noise]|user:and in what way are you talking about	right	1
agent:but in reality i think what you would wind up with is a political football where they would see all these body counts that they can use to for their own will and i just don't think it would work|user:yeah [laughter]|user:that's true	when do they assume this is gonna be proposed or mandatory or when when i what what year are they looking at	1
