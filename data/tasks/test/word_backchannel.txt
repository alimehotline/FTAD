no i haven't been camping since i was about sixteen but uh my family used to have a pop-up trailer and we'd go camping to a lot of different places we spent two weeks in Bastrop Texas once it's near Austin um-hum have you ever been camping in any of the big national parks when i go camping i don't i don't like to rough it i like to have s[ome]- a little bit of el[ectricity]- electricity and a little bit of running water i'm not really into this going and sitting in a tent for a few days with nothing God i have some friends that go camping for a couple of weeks every summer they're both geologists and they load up their truck with their tent and they go to New Mexico and they just find places to camp and go looking for rocks and doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me uh my friend said that the last time they went uh she just got tired of the tent and it was cold at night and she got tired of eating out of cans and so they stayed in a hotel one night just for fun no kidding no kidding gosh that's what the the the bugs i don't like the bugs yeah the one g[ood]- nice thing i remember about camping with my parents is they had a big hammock and they would always find a couple of a campsite with a couple of good trees to hang it in between and i could just lay in that hammock for hours yeah oh hum we stayed in Galveston Island State Park once but if a storm blew in and it was just horrible and the sand was blowing up our camp the little camping area was pretty near the shore and there were some pretty big dunes before the the camping area and the sand was all blowing up and couldn't even go out of the camper the wind was blowing so hard because you'd get sand in your eyes yeah it was pretty bad yeah pretty bad but we had a good time in our camper we usua[lly]- we usually took box games and things to do in case it rained and they my parents always let us take a couple of friends so we always had a good time yeah yeah and yeah well children aren't easily entertained by just enjoying the nature yeah oh gosh it makes it a little my fiance and i one day would like to own a big motor home mainly because he's a football he's a college football coach and we're gonna have to travel a lot and it'd be nice if we had a big ole motor home and that way i could load up the rest of the wives and go to wherever the football game is and have someplace to sleep without spending big money for a hotel and and park it outside of the stadium and have a good ole time um-hum that is nice no kidding it really is um oh yeah yeah no kidding okay nice talking to you too bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
we just bought our first home after being in school and so we're just first time homeowners who've only been living here about six months oh boy uh-huh oh so y[ou're]- you're an old pro then um-hum well what do you find having to be like out there i've always heard that it was expensive um-hum oh really hm well we uh when we graduated from school in Houston uh my husband w[ent]- went to school at Rice and got his PhD so that that's what brought us here and um we had um heard a lot about Richardson being a good area and the homes there being really nice and but we kind of just got the impression it was out of our price range um-hum yes um-hum really hm yes well that makes sense um-hum hm oh that's good well do you have a lot of homes out there that have um foundation problems that seems to be the pretty much the rule out here hm uh-huh um-hum yes so did it look cracked to you i mean that's how you knew it was broken or oh oh so that's that's how you knew well since like i say we're first time homeowners i'm still scared about everything like that going wrong and how do you know it's going to happen and all um-hum we really like our school out here but we um we were scared to buy a an house in our neighborhood because all of the homes did have these foundation problems and we didn't know um you know if we were afraid we'd be living there and all of a sudden the house would crack in half and split open um-hum hm um-hum well that's good well that's really good well our house is older it's like a nineteen sixty three house that we bought so i'm not doesn't seem like it um i mean i know so much has changed in their technology in the last few years it's slab um-hum um-hum well that's good yes my grandfather was a builder and so my parents always lived in houses that he built and then they knew they were getting a good deal so well i uh appreciate that information about Richardson i know it was um it's got a really good reputation and fourteen years that's pretty good well thank you and well um you g[ood]- good luck with this program then bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh now that's nice yeah somewhat business attire yeah right right exactly well i i work uh i'm a financial analyst and uh uh in my group uh nearly everyone wears a a sports coat and tie uh but that does change in the summer uh they they get a little more lenient and we can wear like uh an open collar or uh a lot of times in the summer i'll try to uh like on a Friday i'll try to take off half a day and maybe go play some golf so uh i'll try to wear a short sleeve shirt and uh um and that that's okay that's appropriate not really it's uh it's just uh in our small group we uh we have a controller and uh we support a senior vice president and uh the senior vice president is uh is big on business attire and so um um he sort of funnels that down to uh to the people that work in his group so um i i i enjoy it i think it uh it makes a nice environment and uh i don't know gives it a little more business type uh atmosphere right see i think that's exactly right you know if if you're uh if you're dressed in a uh a suit and uh to me it ma[ke]- it helps me feel uh sort of like you were saying a lot more confident in myself and uh if i do have to approach the uh the controller or the vice president i feel i just have that l[ittle]- little extra confidence in myself being dressed that way oh i see exactly oh Lord and down in Houston it'd be so hot yeah right i see right right i see right right and i think clothing you know i[t]- it just uh it it does like you were saying the the way you dress makes you feel different ways um if you like when you go out at night uh you may just want to have a casual evening or something so y[ou]- you sort of dress down but if you're going to a uh a social type party then you dress up and that i think it just has a a change on your attitude i see i'm i'm sure that's true yeah right yeah see the winter season's just not that long to to invest a whole lot of money in in uh in the the heavier heavier materials right exactly exactly right and see i think ladies clothing um uh is a lot more varied than than than men's clothing because_1 uh men or at least in my situation you can uh i can wear the same slacks and uh sports coats ne[arly]- nearly all year round and uh ladies you know uh uh i don't know if that's marketing or what but they they definitely have a uh i think a a winter type wardrobe and then a spring and then a summer true right right exactly plus the social attitude you know if if you walk into a place and and uh i know in our office uh our secretary gives everyone a h[ard]- all the ladies a hard time if they wear white shoes i think it's uh is it after uh Labor Day or something i don't know and and uh so you know the the social attitude has a little bit to do with uh i think the way we dress i'm not for sure it's that one in September is when you need to quit yeah right i see right exactly exactly exac[tly]- a lot more uh that's right a lot more helpful ideas that we could be uh spending time and effort on rather than our appearance right i live here in Plano yeah oh really huh yeah right exactly and i think that's you know a North Dallas type attitude and uh because_1 i noticed that uh like even going to church uh seems like people really dress up a lot more uh here in North Dallas going to church and uh i don't know that's that's uh because_1 i i went to school wi[th]- at uh Texas Tech in Lubbock and uh church was a a lot more casual uh rather than uh you know here it's like going to a fashion show almost right to try to keep up with the Jones almost yeah right you can't just wear your sweats and an old T-shirt and right well now that is that is so uh well that is great i appreciate the call you too bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

what are you afraid of with them yes well that's very can be very very true well that's the idea they figure that if they give you a card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it and absolutely well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you will be paying interest i use mine a great deal um for groceries for everything that i can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing right that's all right sounds like you have a little one there oh you have great how old are they oh boy those are two very active uh-huh well uh do you uh do you ever use the ATM machines well i find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks in order to get cash oh that helps right well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their a their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on yeah right absolutely because they figure that that's correct the idea is to use their and uh during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month um-hum right well i think that's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted well i[t]- and oh absolutely preapproved that's their favorite word i think so you're right well it's interesting uh that uh people have the generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go that much spent right well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own and i mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem that's right that's right well it's been enjoyable talking with you right well take good care take care of your little ones uh-huh bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay what do you feel is contributing most to air pollution cars you think so uh-huh yeah i i would have figured that some of the factories may be contributing as much as as uh automobiles um-hum um-hum well if you only have to get your car in inspected once a year you can just go have it fixed real quick right before the inspection and and a lot of when you a lot of places when you go get the inspection they just pull it out of the garage and then pull it back in and they don't really check anything they just make sure the lights work basically have they um-hum oh gosh yeah that'll help less people driving and more peo[ple]- you know more people riding in one car rather than everybody riding to work by themselves will help a little bit and if if everyone car pooled that would cut it down in half uh-huh uh-huh yeah well uh in uh San Antonio the parking downtown i work downtown and the parking is so dadgum expensive you basically have to car pool to be able to afford to park it costs seventy five dollars a month just to park my car so i ride with two other uh girls so that way it will only costs me twenty five dollars a month to park but it's just crazy and it's from what i understand i know a girl in Washington DC and it costs her a couple of hundred dollars a month to park her car yeah and from what i understand New York City is worse that it just costs a fortune to own a car in New York City hum-um yeah yeah um-hum yeah uh once you're in downtown San Antonio it's real easy to get around they have a they have these uh buses that that look like little street cars and they go all around that it's just real easy to get around once you're downtown the problem is getting downtown and they have some uh Park and Ride uh Express is where you go to the the bus stop and you get on the bus and it takes you directly downtown but they don't have enough of them and they're not convenient enough and there just happens to not be one convenient to where i live so if if there were i would ride the bus oh no not really um i've noticed once flying into DFW there was just a a brownish orange haze over the city it was the ugliest thing i had ever seen yeah this is a nice time of the year though when it's so windy it just seems everything is so fresh yeah well yeah i guess so i think it's five and i think we have well it was nice talking to you bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh that's very spicy too i mean these bell peppers and curry oh that sounds really good huh i guess it was is this dinner time for you all done in advance that's um i uh i'm i'm not that great a cook but i was single until i was thirty so i did cook a little you know uh and i cook a little bit now what i like to do mostly is stir fries and my wife normally says you know oh Tom why why don't you make a stir fry tonight so we even we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok and we do a lot of um stir fry vegetables it's it's called a stir fry pan and it and it fits right on your uh si[t]- it fits right on your burner whether it's gas or electric so it's it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does and um normally what happ[en]- what we do is um just you know like two tablespoons of oil maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular oi[l]- vegetable oil but i will use peanut peanut oil or things and then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and um green peppers and um maybe put in a little bit of um garlic and ginger uh beforehand that gives uh uh uh spicier flavor and then after the stir fry is over just mix in um a little bit of uh sometimes chicken broth and corn starch and soy sauce and that sort of makes a uh a glaze that sticks to the the vegetables i've used you turn them over a lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu we don't put in meat cause i guess we're i'm not but uh she likes to watch all the how much red meat and things so we'll do a lot of times vegetarian but it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and uh carrots and celery and green peppers and um oh gee mushrooms it's it's a pretty big and we put that over rice oh you don't oh uh-huh yeah see we never in fact i never had squash growing up my my wife eats more vegetables ate more vegetable than i did growing up i'm i'm from Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town yeah recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato red meat and a potato oh she had all of those types of vegetables see never no vegetables in my family yeah it was really funny well that was a real farm no but i i've i've uh i've heard stories uh oh this is terr[ible]- uh you shouldn't be talking about this right before you're while you're fixing dinner that's right you should be careful that's pretty funny but my dad used to tell stories you know about the way they eat chickens but i never we never we lived in the suburbs we we bought everything in a grocery store there was no but it was funny you know it so but when we got married you know a lot more vegetables a lot more you know a lot of changes i think so too but we just went shopping and we came back with uh with um sweets you know chocolate covered peanuts we came back with sweets we didn't bring all the healthy food back too uh-huh well that's that's supposed to be um the trend of the future but uh the cut back i uh recently was over a friends house that's Indian and uh she had brought Indian sweets into the office and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots yeah that was a sweet and i was like ugh this is a sweet oh it is it's a candy i'm like ugh you know Indian candy is not very good but everything was and everything you didn't notice it at first but everything was sort of hot everything had a little bit of curry in every it was funny even the sweets did when you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it you know it had that that after taste that very it was a very Indian flavor good they didn't have i didn't like her desserts very well they were very yogurt and carrots and pin pistachios pistachio nuts and yogurt and it wasn't very good uh-huh yeah well have we done our ten minutes something like that i think we're no nor[mally]- normally they just come in and they say you've overextended your your conversation oh okay well that's you'll see it will normally it will come on and it'll say you've over extended your conversation you now have fifteen minutes to compl[ete]- fifteen seconds to complete it but uh i've been cut off twice so i just thought in fact just also i'm hearing a siren outside i think my my neighbors car must have got bumped you know he has one of those alarms on his car one of the the neighbor has an alarm on a car and it's going off so i was going to go out and see what they were doing okay hey thanks so much uh-huh and you said this was your fi[rst]- well you'll you'll get a couple more probably i uh if i called yesterday i or Friday maybe i talked to somebody that uh i got them on uh during the day it was a housewife and she was home with two kids and while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background you know that they wanted something and they were arguing back and forth and she just kept talking the whole time it was pretty funny okay hey thanks a lot i'll talk to you later bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay so what do you think uh-huh yeah the person gets killed you know yeah something like that but my problem with capital mur[der]- capital punishment is they don't carry it out so if they're going to have it to me they ought to do it you know they people people been sitting like they had on 20/20 or 48 Hours one of them they had them on the man was twenty years waiting on death row see that don't make no sense yeah and now i think they ought to increase it to all these drug dealers huh-uh they're not going to do it that's my biggest problem is even if you give them the death penalty they appeal it and appeal it and appeal it and there's you know huh what do you mean what have been that's the whole system though isn't it there are a lot of people that aren't guilty that's in jail but you know uh i- i i don't know about if y[ou]- if they was like capital murder and then if they were married then what would you do yeah uh-huh i don't know if i could i could prob[ably]- it depends on the crime my problem would be that like people to me the like the child people the people that's killing kids uh the ones messing with old people those type of people now i i have no pity for them you know but just like if a man and wife is fighting and he kills her that he shouldn't die because it might been accident or you never know what you know what what they done went through together should i say i don't think they give them the death penalty if given today anyway i think they just put them in jail and let them think about it so i don't know yes die because_1 it all depends there's a lot of circumstance sometimes i even feel like and up in another state i think it was Ohio where they don't have uh self-defense laws and i think that's wrong yeah they had them on the news this lady her husband she was sev[en]- i'll never forget it because she was seven months pregnant and he hit her in the stomach and then tried to cut her throat well she shot him and she went to prison she you know she killed him but she lost her baby and then they sent her to jail so that's not right they she's nothing should have happened to her at all he shouldn't have hit her in the stomach i don't care but he did both well he was he he she was abused woman he was he was a a what do you call it abuser he would he would beat his wife all the time oh yeah sh[e]- no she lost the baby he hit her in the stomach with the shovel it's just you know things like that that you know i don't think those women or even a man because_1 a man they had a wo[man]- man that his wife shot him but he didn't die and uh they put her in jail now i don't think anything should happen to him but i think she should stay in there because really she just did it because she wanted to get out the marriage and she wanted all his property see i think that's wrong too but i don't no she she wouldn't have got no property see there was no grounds for divorce she was she wanted out cause she had a boyfriend and it was weird but uh the capital punishment i don't know actually what they give the death penalty for the only thing i i know they give it for is shooting a killing a cop or you know assassination of the President and and something big you know uh-huh i don't know no if they going to give it to them i think they should go ahead you know okay maybe a year or you know like that two years whatever but twenty years ten years on death to me that's worse for them too they're not they don't know when they going to die they know they got the death penalty but that don't mean nothing not anymore uh-huh i don't know they don't they don't put it on the news or they don't broadcast it because you know the i guess they don't just don't uh-huh oh yeah all the people for right uh life or something yeah yeah but i think they going to have to do something to make people wake up like on especially the drug dealers you know the the not the little penny ante ones on the corner i don't think they ought to get in trouble i mean i know they ought to get in trouble i'm not they ought to get in trouble but not not death because_1 see they you know we're to me what they ought to do if they can find the big man because see that's where it's coming from to me it it's coming in here some kind of way i don't care what anybody tells me people tell me i said if the government really want to i think it's all government something to do with the government i really do because if you can stop uh Cuban cigars from coming you can't buy anything Cuban in the United States so why can't they stop anything illegal you know if they really wanted to i think they could they just don't want to put there's too much money people's been bought out you know and that's what's wrong with some of the kids on the street they you can't blame just like the man says he can make two five hundred dollars a day for just taking a bag somewhere and his mom is not getting that much money you know if you think you think about all the kids in the ghetto my mom would probably kill us but but uh you know it's something that has to be done to me if they bring kids into it because now kids are killing and so they going to have to do something with the death penalty or to scare these people i think that's the whole thing they're not scared they know they're not going anywhere uh-huh innocent people not just the drug people i'm talking about innocent people when they have they little drive by shootings and and and see because i'm from Los Angeles see originally i've been in Texas twelve thirteen years but originally in LA they people die all the time just from being in the way at the wrong place you know see you know but i think something should be done for them so but i don't know too much about the death penalty yeah but they don't use that no more they use the the injection thing or whatever it is uh-huh it's funny because i had listened to a comedian talk about the death penalty you know about people saying they they don't have nobody to do this and i said well if somebody killed my husband just because i'll pull the switch i'll even do you know to me if if that person can forgive them fine but what is that man going to do next is he going to go out and kill somebody else you know how many times is it going to take for this man to kill people before you kill him now you know sometimes i can understand maybe if they robbed something they didn't mean to do it okay but how many times you going to go by that how many times you going to this person keep killing so i don't know i guess if you stay out of trouble you don't have you worry about it but uh-huh so i think it just i think it depends on the circumstances and how many times that person has been in trouble i mean really big trouble you know so but that's all i got to say and it is nice talking to you all righty oh it's fun i ca[ll]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

so what kind of eating out do you like yeah i i like seafood or Chinese or especially Mongolian we've got a real nice little Mongolian restaurant here yeah i go out there probably once a week it's not bad you know you have to find out the right things to get so you get the most for your money but the the two mea[t]- the two plates of meat and one plate of vegetables is a pretty good deal naturally yeah no oh yeah do yo[u]- do yeah do you have a S[teak]- do you have a Steak and Ale there um i haven't been to Steak and Ale for a long time but my favorite used to be their steak and uh Alaskan king crab oh that was good yeah yeah they they had they had really nice Alaskan king crab of course it was expensive though dinner for two was about fifty bucks uh-huh and now that i'm full time poor student uh i got to watch the pennies consequently that's why you go out to Mongolian all the time yeah i haven't found a good Mexican restaurant around here anywhere i i'm at i usually do all my own Mexican food i my i'm partial to burritos and tacos and i and i do them better than anywhere i've had out so and i can do them cheaper and i can do them my way and places place uh basically the food and the price i it's sort it's set up on a sort of a buffet sort of thing you go up and pick your own vegetables and all that fill up your own plate and then you drop it off at the uh grill and then go sit down and they they fry it out and season it the way you want it seasoned and then they bring it out to you and the price is really reasonable the the drawback is that all the uh all the staff are uh are uh either Koreans or uh or Thais and they can't speak English very well so it gets a little bit difficult trying to explain uh some things to them but if you can get past that it's okay the food is really good i don't know i to me that's the thing that you got to have if the food is bad you're obviously not going to go back but if the food is good and the price is decent and the service is lousy i have a tough time going back again course a yeah yeah i mean it's it's not worth the hassle just for the good food there's plenty of places that have good food uh-huh yeah yeah i i hardly ever give the people a second try if if somebody's rude to me or excuse me somebody's rude or something like that i won't go back i don't care how good the food was but generally i i the places i've been where i've had trouble with the help generally the food hasn't been that good anyway which is sort of indicative of the whole problem uh well gosh now what i guess it's been about five minutes i try to go out once a week sometimes more than that i about every other weekend i go down to Charlotte and uh see my my ex-college buddy down there and uh we go out running around down there and there's some pretty good places down there to eat but we've got a uh family there's a family restaurant here i don't know if they're over in Texas yet i know they're in Louisiana it's called Ryan's um it's a it's a good restaurant they uh they have like a big food bar and you can order from the menu or uh just take the food bar and the food bar usually has all kinds of entree items or salads and all that and they've just got tons of stuff and it's really cheap one person for about it's about six bucks and it's all you can eat and the food is good and of course you your service is pretty good because it's serve yourself can't complain too much they they they have people come around and uh deliver your your meal from the kitchen if you ordered a steak or something and fill up your iced tea but other than that they don't they don't bother you so it's a pretty good place i bet you don't have those over there we have uh there's two of them in Charlotte and we've been to both of them and they're both terrible it was it was i was amazed because i've been in a lot of Ryan's in Alabama and Georgia and this is my first time in one in North Carolina and they were terrible and we got one in Raleigh here and i thought it was pretty bad until i had gone to those ones in Charlotte yeah we we figured this is probably the best one but uh it's it's a pretty neat chain because they they don't take out loans for anything they when they build a building they pay for it right then so that when they open the door they're making money immediately it's it's a smart operation uh-huh um-hum yeah um i would yeah exactly and and you and you cook it yourself gosh that's half the fun cooking it yourself well that's that's an interesting sounding place yeah yeah that sounds pretty neat it'd be worth giving a try that's pretty interesting i've never heard of anything like that yeah huh that's a unique idea i gue[ss]- i guess that's part of the game nowadays in fast food you got to come up with some catchy idea yeah he he surely doesn't have to worry about supply that's a pretty good idea huh maybe i'll start a restaurant now i don't know if i trust these people in Raleigh to cook anything though probably burn the place down well come to think i've never even seen a Mexican here we got lots of Kuwaitis and Iranians and Iraqis but gosh oh well well i guess that about does it on the fast food circuit doesn't it some of the subjects i tell you it was good talking to you Jackie you have a good night um bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay do you um have a garden um-hum do you enjoy working out in the yard um-hum uh-huh i've had some roses out in my backyard too and they've done real well i was surprised i we had some in Virginia and they were real hard to keep up with but seems like they like the Texas climate better right yeah we built up our we built up boxes and put them_1 in that so that they would drain because_1 our soil is so bad where i live do you live in Texas or Plano oh yeah i'm out in Rowlett and we have that brown clay and it's real hard to grow anything here uh-huh oh that's accommodating yeah right we've got a few things too it's hard to tell if they'll come back or not well that's good we we planted three pecan trees out front and every one of them_1 died i told my husband this is the last one if it dies we're going to something else but we dug a hole about six times as big as it needs to be and filled it with all kinds of compost and pine needles and everything else we could think of hopefully it'll drain this year yeah yeah it's hard to find something that'll take the heat as well as the freezing that we get down here i have a few little flowers i plant around the trees out front i've enjoyed doing those i put uh pansies out in the winter and they pretty much last all winter and then i put uh moss rose out in the summer and it just goes crazy you don't really have to do anything to it puts a lot of color out there all year right oh yeah those do pretty well here don't they we've got my husband put a little row of those out in the backyard to kind of make a little cut so that the kids wouldn't come marching through the yard and everything yeah right yeah the only thing i don't like about them_1 is weeding around them_1 because_1 they get so sharp pricky things get in your hands oh really yeah we do it my husband does most of the mowing and edging and all that stuff yeah we get something on the door about every week uh-huh yeah really oh our neighbor has a lawn service come and do his and i don't think it looks any better than what my husband does so i'm not really tempted to do that either if yeah i can mow the backyard but there's something about the grass in our front yard is so dense that the mower wheels just kind of bog down in there and i can not push it oh really huh i would like a self-propelled one i think that might make it easier yeah ours is not that big but like i said if i had to mow the front i'd be stuck because i can't get it to move oh oh i'm sure yeah that's a pretty large area really did people up there edge as as strictly and stuff as they do down here yeah yeah i lived in a town it was a college town in Virginia and i mean people kept their lawns mowed but they sure didn't get into it like they do here in Texas wasn't a source of pride or something like it is down here yeah um-hum yeah yeah it's hard i know we tried to do our landscaping out front my husband tilled it up in the fall and then we've been waiting on some guy supposed to be getting us some edging for like ten cents a foot instead of about a dollar and uh he has never got it to us so it just sits out there kind of dug up and doesn't look too good so i can't say anything about anybody else's yeah it'd seem like they'd want to just to uh get some shade and keep their houses a little bit cooler in the summer yeah yeah yeah did they not put any in in your neighborhood we had two trees in the front of our yard and then one of them died and so we that's where we keep putting that pecan keeps dying we have uh i think it's a Silver Leaf Maple or something like that that's hung on out there right yeah hope ours continues to live it's been there about four i guess almost four years now so maybe it's e[stablished]- established enough that it'll go on and survive i like an oak oak trees yeah my um husband's father has a place out in East Texas so he's always digging up little red oaks and things like that and trying to bring them_1 back and start them_1 but so far we haven't had much luck uh-huh oh oh yeah well that's too bad we've got all of our trees from Calloway's and luckily they'll take them_1 back any time for any reason if they die so um-hum uh-huh yeah i know the guy at Wolfe told us they cut back on the tree warranty like six months or less but Calloway's has kept theirs forever so yeah yeah i don't know we haven't bought uh-huh we haven't bought any shr[ubs]- shrubs yet hopefully i think we've almost waited this too late this year now to start putting in anything of any size yeah oh really it wouldn't matter if we plant them_1 when it was starting to get warmer root stimulator yeah oh well that's good to know maybe there's still hope for our front yard this summer then uh-huh yeah i've i've noticed that they haven't had anything great right yeah yeah except last year we thought some were dead and finally they started leafing out again at the bottom so we just cut them_1 way back and and was able to save them_1 but this year they look even worse um-hum yeah huh ours haven't done anything yet this year yeah i like crepe myrtles they really add a lot of color in the summer oh we haven't had that problem yet they're pretty ours are pretty small oh really yeah oh does it grow along a fence or something oh uh-huh uh-huh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

if it had rained any more in the last two weeks instead of planting Saint Augustine grass in the front yard i think i would have plowed everything under and had a rice field it's so bad wanted to mow today i was off and i wanted to mow the yard but just walking across it it's still so mushy if i took a mower out there i'd tear the sod up so bad it's steady but it's not in the amounts that we been getting normally we get an inch here and then a week or so will pass and you pick up another inch inch and a half we're getting hit by three and four inch bursts at a time well that's where the front had came come from they said it came out of the Pacific run across California who was really needing the rain it should've it should've stalled over them for a couple more days well maybe i maybe i can get the yard mowed before it hits isn't it a little late in the season for that type of ice storm though yeah i'd seen the storm you were talking about when it hit um up around the Chicago area uh they had a little film clip about how bad it was up there and i just could not believe how much ice that thing was carrying with it how do you thaw one out after it's been coated like that i've always lived down in this part of the country and i'm not used you know we had an ice storm or a sleet and a good freeze and the windshield ices over and you take hot water or warm water out of the tap and thaw your windshield just hearing what it does to the lawn i hate to even guess what the road conditions would be like in something like that sounds like the aftermath of like a hurricane down here well we get the same things trees being uprooted limbs falling all over the place power lines getting torn completely off the poles being completely pulled out of the ground we get maybe all winter long we might end up with twenty five days of really cold weather and of those by the time it gets lunch time as as long as the wind's not blowing it's bearable uh i think of any thirty five and below as cold another thing that saves us during the winter time is if we get a breeze coming straight off the Gulf the wind chill factor blows everything out of proportion uh most of the time during the winter that we've got an offshore wind which is blowing straight out trying to think where's the warmest the warm lines start i guess probably if you're drawing a line across a map of the country put the middle of your ruler on Dallas they get snow up there but it's it's not a long lasting snow it'll be there they may have a week of it then it warms back up into the high thirties and forties you get much above you get much above the Texas border on in that sec[tor]- sector of the map and get up into Oklahoma they've got a little bit longer winter they're catching all the cold breezes coming straight off the Rockies straight across Kansas and Nebraska and there's nothing the only thing that stands between Oklahoma and Kansas and Nebraska there's a barb wire fence somewhere around Topeka that's the only thing to slow down the wind	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so what's your favorite team or do you have a favorite team or Bengals yeah uh i w[as]- uh i was pulling for the Bengals when they uh lost the Super Bowl two years ago was it yeah i- i pulled for them for the sole reason because i didn't want 49ers to win anybody who plays the 49ers really yeah yeah that's true uh my favorite team is are is are the Raiders yeah i mean i've liked them ever since the season that they won the Super Bowl last i think it was eighty four i think it was and uh i pretty much like them ever since that and they they haven't produced since then but but least i've stuck with them i'm loyal yeah yeah what other teams uh do you like up there or do you not watch much football oh really every Sunday and Monday oh that's right yeah me neither it's kind of like they they gave me the topic and i'm like football jeez it's been a long time did you know that they're playing a game today yeah they're playing it right now yeah i think it's uh ABC that's carrying it it's either ABC or NBC one or the other i think i'm not too sure one of the major stations it's uh Barcelona versus New York yeah the temperature's just not right yeah we usually don't uh we usually don't have very cold weather down here you know during uh during football season it it gets colder later on in the season but it takes a good while for it to get cold but couple couple Christmases ago we had a a freak storm and i live near the coast actually i live like right on the coast of North Carolina and uh what they they called it like a winter hurricane and so instead of bringing high winds and destruction and rain it just brought a lot of snow and basically it rain it it snowed only on the coast but not inland so the coast was completely we had like ten foot snow drifts which in the coast we barely get an inch of snow a year yeah and so we you know because being near the water we get less snow than anybody else and this time we had a bunch of snow we we i had fun playing in in the snow playing football in the snow and so i mean i- i had never done that before and it's it's so much fun because you can hit harder and land harder and it doesn't matter because it's snow and yeah yeah well we had like layers of clothing to keep away the snow yeah but the snow also helps you know and it it we had like one foot deep snow in this in this open field and so it was a little hard to run but when you got hit and you fell you didn't really feel it you just felt the hit of the person but when you hit the ground it was you know just snow it was it was pretty fun but it's it's a lot better to play it in the cold weather that's true well right now we're having nice weather i- i probably say in in the upper sixties maybe lower seventies right now yeah especially at this time yeah is it very windy up there now yeah we had some pretty strong winds pick up this morning and they've been up been with us all day well yeah this is the first time i've talked with someone up north really mostly i've been talking with people in Texas seems like they have ninety percent of the people calling from Texas yeah nice talking to you too bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
okay uh well we probably have about three months approximately um-hum um-hum we live on a it used to be a farm but we don't farm much we uh but we do have a garden oh i wish i could be doing that uh-huh uh-huh you right yeah you almost have to get started pretty early probably i guess uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah you've had more freezing this or this yeah winter i think more bad weather um-hum um-hum um-hum are you do you work or are you retired or you uh uh my husbands retired but he's not a gardener he he he's been helping me more but he really isn't re[al]- uh real crazy about gardening but uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh uh-huh um-hum huh oh yeah but it's a pleasure to like you said it's good to get outside and and i like i like my garden too we didn't have to we have just a small garden but we planted corn last year too that which takes quite a bit of space and we we didn't have too good luck with it because the uh we had a couple good real good wind storms and it really damaged the corn so we didn't get too much corn last year uh-huh uh-huh oh uh-huh hum um-hum um-hum oh that's great uh-huh uh-huh yeah we don't we don't usually cover ours we did a few different times sometimes we've covered with the plastic and other years we've tried newspapers and uh but we generally don't we do our watering from our spring uh yeah we have an old fashioned tub sitting that you know water runs into and and uh my husband set up a pump that runs it runs till it's down and then it stops and then when the water comes up it comes on again and we use that to water our garden with so oh i do i love it i'd rather be doing that than housework uh not a whole well not a whole lot i think our cabbages and broccolis and that we have more trouble with that type of thing with the the yeah uh uh-huh uh do you go more for natural keeping them off naturally or do you use insecticides uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah well our lawn is is a big lawn because_1 because we live out in the country and so we were not our lawn is not perfect you know it's just the it's just a lawn if uh-huh do you eat any of them oh did well did does your wife ever make uh a bake in a hot bacon dressing like for salad oh it's delicious and it goes real good on dandelions um-hum um-hum uh uh-huh this is the use the greens and you get them when they're young and tender you know before they've grown too too taut because they do get a little stringy but uh they're kind of fun to to try get a get a few and throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes yeah yeah i don't know but i've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband's back and he's been having trouble with so wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower so it takes about four hours to cut our grass and we have we have hills i'm afraid of the hills but i'm getting on to it i just pretend they're not there and i just go ahead and do it yeah uh-huh uh-huh oh that's great great that's a lot of people don't have that much space even that uh-huh so you have all the conveniences of a city yeah and and the country also uh-huh well you never have enough room do you think no especially if your into any hobbies or anything or uh-huh roly-poly what is it a bug you mean a worm a cut worm not a grub worm oh um um-hum i'm trying to think of what they are what kind they would be you find them under bricks usually and that they're not a slug not a yeah yeah yeah oh really they are not hard are they are they a hard worm they're not a hard huh oh are they black then but they roll up i can't think of what kind they would be uh-huh i'm no help on that then because i i can't think of what they are what they would be i think you have a lot more insects down there even than than what we have uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i know my brother had trouble with fire ants and that even uh yeah and they be can be a real dickens uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah yeah you keep trading them yeah uh-huh uh-huh ours are going to be coming out now our cancer society sales daffodils right now they're they're big now so we we have daffodils for in the house because of the cut flowers but they're just beginning to come out the end bud oh oh oh they're such a nice bright early spring color um-hum um-hum um-hum and they're beautiful too yeah they're beautiful uh-huh oh my yeah no we won't have too much here for another couple of months yet really yeah yeah

do you have a favorite basketball team the Lakers LA okay uh how they doing this year i'm not i haven't even been following them very much i know they lost recently to the Bucks in Milwaukee that's that's where i'm from so Mavericks do have problems without Roy Tarpley they're not going anywhere yeah they do they always seem to get the talent there well they i think yeah i think Milwaukee got lucky because Magic Johnson sat out that game uh-huh do you think the Lakers can win the championship this year you don't like Mike Dunleavy yeah he didn't they didn't let him have quite the the flair that uh Mike Riley had well Dunleavy's a good coach though he was yeah we[ll]- he doesn't have that Hollywood attitude no i'm pretty familiar with with Dunleavy because_1 he was an assistant at Milwaukee uh yeah and he uh wh[en]- when they had uh injury problems with some of their major players uh he actually put on a uniform and went out and played they they signed him to a ten day contract and uh he became a player even though he's assistant coach the guy knows basketball i think he'll do all right for the Lakers oh yeah oh yeah it's fun i'm watching the i'm i'm busy watching the NC double A tournament uh the past couple weeks and the NIT semifinals are on tonight uh-huh yeah right so are any of those teams of interest to you oh yeah well they're they're just Larry Johnson right well they're just head and shoulders above everybody else this year oh yeah they're they're so much better than anybody else it's uh that they're prohibitive favorites in winning all their games right well it's it's just unbelievable how many games they play in in college now Arkansas played thirty four games this year that's almost half of a pro season it's too many for students right they're talking tonight about this NIT game with Stanford and Massachusetts that the Stanford players actually took their final exams while they were on the road playing basketball they have an honor system there where they wou[ld]- they had uh three hours to take their exams they sent them in by uh by fax and uh i guess b[y]- they used laptop computers to uh to get their exams finished send them out by Federal Express and fax machine yeah it's incredible that uh that they have to do that i mean some of the the schools give you a break they give the students a break where they can take their exams when they get back from from a tournament but uh these guys were actually on the road uh two thousand miles fr[om]- from home when they had to file their uh their final exams and send them in yeah yeah yep i don't know so do you think uh you think Vegas is going to win the finals then i think so too they plaid Duke and uh Duke has a lot to uh to atone for here last year that lost to Vegas in the finals by thirty points Kansas is a real surprise i didn't expect them to get that far uh they beat Arkansas yeah Arkansas just uh they had a rough second half they came out uh real hot in the first half Todd Davis hitting his three pointers yeah uh somebody took the fire out from under them they they weren't getting their shots anymore and Kansas just crept up on them and uh uh it was unbelievable because_1 they they did that a few years ago too when they were seated a lot lower and they won th[e]- the championship but i don't think they yeah well they they are just that much better they've got so many stars well sure i think anybody can can win on a given night but they have so much talents and the average age on that team is twenty two years old they've got a lot of fifth year seniors that are playing guys that are playing for long time uh they're playing Duke uh this weekend uh the average age on Duke's team is nineteen years old Vegas the average age is over twenty two so they've got just so much more experience than anybody else in the tournament right now but they're going to lose all those guys at the end of the season they're going to all turn pro i think Stacy Augmon's a senior and Larry Johnson i don't think i think he's uh is he a senior or junior i'm not Larry Johnson i think he's coming out this year uh-huh and Anderson Hunt all their uh their best players i think are graduating well maybe not graduating but at least be entering the the pro draft oh yeah for sure yeah George Akals and Stacy Augmon Anderson Hunt uh-huh uh well i wouldn't say that i- i think yeah their coach may not be there i think Jerry Tarkenyon may be headed for the pros there's some talk that he may be uh coaching for the LA Clippers next year they have a great amount of talent but they just have poor coaching i think they've got some great players on that team i just think that yeah uh-huh uh-huh well Houston's playing really well lately last couple of weeks anyway since Akeem uh-huh sure i think Houston's playing really good ball lately ever since Akeem changed his uh first name to Hakeem he added the H to the front well uh i can understand that it's uh i don't know why he dropped it in the first place but uh sure so who do you think's going to win the NBA this year Port[land]- Portland's looking awfully good Isiah Thomas Detroit Detroit Pistons they're not as good as they were last year they'll have to pick it up in the in the tournament then Chicago's playing really good ball with Michael Jordan and i think they finally put things together yeah well Chicago they they've been struggling last couple of years and they've had a good team for the past few years ever since they had Michael Jordan but they never did seem to make an impact on the play-offs i think this year they're going to really uh show some talent oh yeah it's not true they have a good supporting cast Boston Celtics right yeah i don't think the Celtics quite have the overall talent that it takes to win the NBA this year they've got good individual players but some are getting old Robert Parish is thirty seven years old he's still playing center and uh Larry Bird's talking about retirement here i guess in another year yeah but they're bringing in some good young players too which is good i'm i've always favored Milwaukee being from that area and they've made some good moves in personnel but i don't see them as having the the type of talent that will win the NBA this year they have to get by Detroit and Chicago i think either one of them is a real tough challenge for them but yeah i don't think Atlanta would be much as much a problem as Chicago uh-huh right	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

okay the topic said to discuss the weather what is it like where you are and how's that different from normal and well let's see if you're in Plano and i'm in Plano are you in east Plano or west Plano okay well i'm in east Plano i'm out in Las Rios so it's bound to be different over here but yeah yeah oh got a little sunburn yeah wow i worked around in the yard a little bit and i've got sunburned a few years ago and you know got one of those what second or third degree burns and the doctor looked at it and said don't ever don't ever let that area get sunburned again and uh it's got the you know the kind of the black freckled things on it that the doctor looks at every once in a while for that what melanoma business so i am super whenever we go down to Galveston to the beach or something like that you know i look kind of stupid i'm out there in a T-shirt and everything else pretty much covered up but uh you know i'm never going to let my shoulders and back get sunburned again um-hum well it is March after all you know you're not supposed to worry about sunburn in March that's right yeah well yeah i hope so yeah we're going to go to Lubbock they'll probably have another sandstorm out there you know big Lubbock yeah are you a native type Planoite or you been here a while or okay well well where did you come from originally oh okay well i'm a Tech graduate so yeah i grew up over in New Mexico at Roswell and my wife is from Plains if you know where Plains is it's on the it's on the road where do you know where well you go south out of Lubbock down to Brownfield and then you like you're headed over toward Roswell Plains is right there uh about fifteen miles in from the New Mexico line so so yeah you talk of little towns in west Texas yeah i'm okay yeah i know where Panhandle is that's north up there isn't it yeah yeah yeah i had a friend who lived in Dumas so yeah so anyway yeah we're kind of familiar with that part of the world now there's where the weather's interesting i think it's kind of dull around here compared to yeah my mother still lives in Lubbock and we talked to her the other day and they said Friday they had or Thursday or Friday they had a you know one of the world class sandstorms out there that happens every once in a while hadn't had one like that in a couple of years yeah i recall a {snirtstorm} out there one day where about this time of year that there was a big cold front coming in and they got the dirt up in the air and then it snowed a little bit and uh i can imagine that happening more in Amarillo than i could in Lubbock but still anywhere out there it could happen yeah i we like i said i grew up in New Mexico we lived in Albuque[rque]- Karen and i both lived in Albuquerque for quite a long time and then i went to work for TI here and i came here in sixty nine and then seventy two they opened or seventy three they opened up that plant out there in Lubbock and uh man that was like going home and uh so we went out there were there for about ten years until that all folded up out there ended up coming back but uh yeah the weather out there was uh-huh it it could get a little bit a little bit interesting now and again uh-huh well if you've been here for three years you didn't get here the year they had the big freeze and stuff here did you what was that eighty eighty four oh wow that would have been six or seven years ago then um-hum with the ice yeah well the uh was it i guess it was three years ago that they had the real right before was it right before Christmas or where y[eah]- yeah got down to around zero somewhere and then warmed back up and killed everything off yeah that was that was bad news we're still try i set out a whole bunch of crepe myrtles and stuff and of course it killed them_1 well they all come back from from the bottom so i'm getting kind of convinced that if something doesn't grow naturally here there's no sense in planting it because eventually you're going to lose it and you noticed all the pretty little trees that are out everything now the native trees they're they know better they know better yeah yeah um-hum um-hum yeah well you're just about there i think it's um-hum well we moved into this house it was a year old and the landscaping was {semi-in} but there was still a lot more to do and one of the things that uh well they were really selling everybody on back then was this Indian Hawthorne boy you know that's the best stuff in the world well i am somewhat less than enthused about that i've got some out here that's five six years old now and still doesn't look a whole lot different than the day that i put it in and then and i noticed that a lot of the garden well you know that Indian Hawthorne that didn't work out quite as well as we thought you know so now they're pushing something else yeah yeah well anyway uh if it if it doesn't grow out in the woods here somewhere i'm not plant yeah this uh photinia the red tipped photinia it seems to do pretty good we've got some here that's really taken off um-hum that and uh the little dwarf yaupon hollies you know they they seem to or just yaupons period seem to do all right we've got a couple of Live Oaks in the front yard and of course they're they weren't native to this particular spot but they seem to have done pretty good and and uh yeah it's it's it's a strange one it will kind of scare you if you don't know what it's doing because_1 right now is when it's dropping it's leaves and you go out there and look at your tree after a good windstorm and the thing is bare and you think oh no but you look look real close and there's all the little new leaves getting ready to come out so it holds it's leaves all winter then loses them in the spring that and that red what is it red oak we're thinking about putting one of those in uh-huh well you know i heard something about that here whether Neil uh here again it may have been Neil Sperry they say you know everybody looks at these oaks and says yeah they grow slow and all that but most of the time that's the way that the native ones grow because they don't get the water they don't get the they're they're growing under bad conditions and uh if you bring one in and put it under good conditions they'll grow about as fast as any tree so yeah so anyway that's that was i guess he was talking about some of the other kinds of oaks i don't know whether the live uh live oaks is not really an oak i guess it's something oh yeah it just got the the name of being an oak because_1 it's got a kind of an acorn kind of thing on it but uh i think the real honest to gosh oaks like the what bur oaks and pin oaks and red oaks and all that sort of thing they they'll grow a lot faster well i guess we were supposed to be talking about the weather but that's yeah well are you with TI yeah how many these have you gotten very many of these calls at home okay well i got the first one this evening that i had gotten at home i i'd made a couple at work you know but uh ma[de]- made several from work but i'd never uh i'd never gotten one yet i was just yeah yeah well you know you'd think that this crazy system if you're going to talk about something about the weather they'd have tried to plug you in with plug you in to somebody New York or something yeah yeah weather difference between east and west Plano clear across town well when we lived in Albuquerque there was such a elevation difference there that there was a weather difference between the valley and the heights you know it would be snowing up in our area and then the

all right what are some of your favorite foods i imagine with Argentina you've got some great foods uh-huh yes uh i've had i've had that meal in New York uh where they bring you a plank sort of with all this wonderful beef parts of beef cooked and barbecued and it's marvelous uh i have i have to find a place around here that has that okay i'll keep that in mind yeah you serve that yourself or the for a family you ever serve that yourself when you have company uh-huh yeah oh that do you buy them um separately at you know an American grocery store now or do you have to or you don't you don't go buy it from a a wholesaler little butcher shops yeah yeah i['ve]- i've lived in Mexico so i know yeah yeah yeah you have to you have poultry place what do you what other what dishes do you serve with it yeah i the turnover the stuffed turnovers oh i love those uh-huh yeah uh-huh do you remember when you were in Washington Sam the Argentine baker it used to be in Georgetown years ago he moved i guess he he retired and went back to Argentina i guess in nine[teen]- the early seventies yes so that mu[st]- that's before your time your parents might remember if they were here then okay i mean he was wonderful i we used to get the most marvelous empenadas and other Argentine things yeah i'm Italian uh-huh yeah well because there're many Italians in Argentina um-hum uh-huh yeah my grandparents my grandfather came to the United States through Argentina this was around the turn of the century actually actually a little bit later like nine[teen]- uh nineteen thirteen nineteen twelve nineteen thirteen yeah well i'll tell you it's interesting because when we cook here i'm of Italian descent my husband is Chinese so we and we both love Eu[ropean]- Continental cooking French cooking so we cook uh our meals are well we don't d[o]- we don't usually mix i mean that's well sometimes well if we're entertaining we'll do a Chinese recipe and um there are really easy recipe that is you know with Chinese you always have several dishes and nowadays with microwaves you can steam many of the things in a microwave i don't know if you have one and if you like Chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it and chop some scallions and a little ginger and just cover it with some uh waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done and it's a wonderful um flavorful piece of fish yeah um-hum um-hum yeah buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish mar[ket]- uh the fish counter um uh any white fish sole is good um um flounder sole or flounder is real good and even grouper little bit of soy sauce and sesa[me]- sesame seed oil and not too much soy sauce uh some chopped up scall[ions]- um you know slivers of scallions and slivers of ginger and then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just just two say two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes and if the fish flakes it's done don't overcook it though yeah well till you just check it you know during and another quick dish if you like um if do you know what hoi sin sauce is it's that sweet Chinese sauce well if you go in a Chinese store ask for hoi sin H O I S I N H O I S I N or S E N either way they'll spell it hoi sin sauce it's a very sweet dark sort of a purplish plum sauce purplish brown and if you take uh little pieces of pork and you fry them like little cubes of pork and you fry them with garlic and a little bit of couple dashes of hot pepper and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce that you can serve over rice um well for two people um Ame[rican]- uh if it's American style i'd buy a half a pound if you know we if you're just serving that but if you're serving another dish with it say the rice dish um well with guys pretty healthy appetite i'd probably go a third of a pound and then you know you could and you can always you can always heat it up again and save you know yeah you can also do the same thing using um if you have ground beef just stir fry the ground beef drain off the oil use the same hoi sin sauce and um some of the frozen mixed vegetables just stir that in and you've got a very colorful side another dish um the hoi sin sauce oh a dollar twenty nine a can a can would serve would serve you for you know for quite a few um meals you know oh no no no no no it's not it's not expensive at all it's o[ne]- it's one of the Chinese cooking basics yeah well listen it was good talking with you hope you enjoy your recipe okay bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

it's it's hard to[pic]- topic because is it is it is it doing a good job or a bad job and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to uh uh high school yes well yeah i am um act[ually]- actually i think that i at the higher level education i don't think there's so much of a problem there it's pretty much funded well there are small colleges that i'm sure are struggling but uh it's the job that the the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours our school even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in New York City or Washington DC uh i would seriously consider moving if i had a child i wouldn't let them go to a public school system there but of course people are trapped economically and they can't do that well that's really too bad because i[t]- it it's giving some people unfair advantage i mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in Florida what we learned yeah yeah oh they they have that down there that yeah it's like if if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school yeah that's where i was fortunate i'm a i'm a technician and we had a vocational um electronics in our high school so when i went to my first year of tech school uh i had a very easy time because our high school had a a good program yeah i find that that the that in the in the cities it's more less the kids go there to socialize not really to learn and the parents send them_1 there because they're supposed to and plus it gets them out of their hair and i also find that that you can send a kid to school but if don't work with them as a parent i think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage yeah well i could i could see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if they're you know come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about trying to work and or maybe they're unemployed and they're mad at the world i can see where that wouldn't be very good for a a kid you know he's coming up will you help me with my homework and they're no get away from me i've had a terrible day so it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from yes are they going to move to uh Mexico yeah maybe the maybe they'll bring their good schools with them you know if the industry comes hopefully they'll promote good schools because i know the town that i come from the the uh the large IBM plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one and plus for for the type of student that's going to that school it's going to raise the level of the school because your parents are engineers or chemists they're they're you're most likely to do better in school they're going to help you yeah you hope well i think i- i don't know i just think it it's it's a duty of the parent to do that i mean jeez my parents always helped me and i don't know it's just like you say it's the way you're raised and the economic situation you're in i can see some lady she's twenty one years old and she's got four kids a kid in her first grader i don't see where she's going to have much time for him so i don't know it's just like i don't know actually i think it i think it should be a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and t[o]- to see what they need and not overinflate it like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go hey now wait a minute we're in a recession here we uh our town didn't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many many years just because people are are in the recession and they're even though we've uh enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five people are going whoa so yeah but i always see it's all it's all money this like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime It it's it's all money based and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level and and then if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school who knows bu[t]- maybe we do we need some more Catholic schools support the church instead they seem to have done a the good job in the past in uh some places uh you couldn't go to a public school it was miles down the road and the only school you could go to was the Baptist school or the Catholic school so yeah the i don't yeah i don't know if i would do that to my but so hum pretty much though see i don't have any good ideas or or anything that would contribute see this isn't a subject that i think a lot about because i'm never faced with it because our school system in Vermont it seems to do a really good job is it well that well so you have to go to a lesser engineering school we have a very good public school up here and a degree out there means a lot it's a very good school it's it's University of Vermont um we also have some two year college well there's a four year colleges they all have a pretty good reputation but like you say you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

so what do you think about a year or two of public service uh-huh yes yeah um-hum uh-huh you know i- i really agree with you um i uh though i've never done that myself i i'm was a basically an education major when i graduated from college and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to um very rural children in a very low income district and i spent a year teaching there and i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from a nice middle class white suburban home and i did it um for one reason i wanted i was working on a masters degree so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live someplace else so totally different than my own upbringing and i it changed it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me and i think um in fact if if i had to do it all again i you know i- i after that you know you never think of it because i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about doing that because i had all these college loans i'd started paying back um be[cause]- so that was that was one reason why i never considered it but now that i'm further along and i'm still paying these college loans i- i think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because_1 i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school at thirty years old um i've had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the Peace Corps you can have them delayed uh and i thought that was you know very interesting and i- i would have thought of that earlier i probably would have done you know just like is that is this is that the Mormon church that does that um-hum because_1 one of my neighbors uh did that in Pittsburgh from Pittsburgh and i thought you know that really now that i'm thirty years old i think that one or two years out of my life would've probably like you said to be able to travel someplace else whether it be the United States or outside the country i think would've been a very good um experience for me um-hum um-hum yes um-hum um-hum yeah and i think you know we have such a need now you know i taught you know i- i think i was paid uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year and i worked in a very rural school district and i- i one of the things i taught was a computer class and these kids um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors and i and i just there you know they came from poverty they were going to continue in poverty and it was it was the school district couldn't hire many people it was very difficult for them to hire and i think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for um just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical um things i think it's a really good idea and even if it is overseas see i never i- i tell you sometimes i worry about things overseas because we have such problems right here in our own country um-hum yeah um-hum yeah right um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah i think it would also help them_1 if they then went on to college i know that my first couple of years of college were um uh probably too carefree at the beginning and then at the end i had to be too serious um-hum um-hum yeah that's true um-hum that's right i yeah i think i think this was this was a very interesting topic uh because it's something that you know we don't talk about in this country probably enough uh you know um-hum yep that's true um-hum oh i think it is i really think i think um people you should i you know the kids today i teach i spend a lot of my time teaching college students and um i find great disgust in them in their in their um their self-centeredness and their inability to understand um multicultural or multiracial situations and i really you know they don't understand uh how other people live um they don't understand um-hum yep i think that's uh j[ust]- just having a good time i uh a friend of mine is a psychologist and he always refers to it as uh short-term pleasure oriented i guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it you know today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun um-hum yeah well they say i think i um have read recently that uh the Bush Administration has increased the uh funding for the Peace Corps uh-huh because i guess because_1 of the changes in Eastern Europe uh they've increased funding for the Peace Corps some of the i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known when they're decreasing some of the military spending some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps and some of the other overseas programs uh um-hum um-hum yes yeah that's true um-hum yeah that's very true you know how many is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country and i guess i- i live near Washington being in in Baltimore it's something like one in four people in the Washington area are lawyers and and i- i just sort of think that's ridiculous yeah with you know with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and uh you know the the problems we have with AIDS and cancer and and that how come everybody is a lawyer you know you know um-hum right um-hum um-hum yeah you saw statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run yeah that's true that's interesting um-hum okay hey thanks so much for the conversation well thank you very much bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well who's the team oh really well i i'm picking Duke because_1 uh they just won it yeah it's just yeah it's just over just uh about f[ive]- ten minutes ago i guess it was a good game uh they won by about eight i think either five or eight it was a good game but uh Duke was just too much for them_1 Kansas just couldn't couldn't hang with them oh yeah and see i was i was really thinking that they might have a let down because_1 i i i was in a basketball pot and i picked uh Kansas for i guess more or less an upset but i i was thinking that uh Duke might have a let down after playing such a tough game with UNLV but uh i tell you what they uh they came back and put it to them_1 it was a good game but i i i had thought all the way through that UNLV was going to be the team that would just walk away with it that's that's right i tell you what they uh they they looked like they were just men among boys but they they they fell i tell you yeah yeah they they just need to go for it instead of uh worrying about the other team because_1 i think if they would play their game i don't know if there's anybody that could that could keep up with them but uh i i was since the yeah that's right yeah here in Dallas i'll tell you what the the Mavericks are having just all kinds of problems i tell you oh really yeah so he he's uh he's probably going to be going to jail and and the problem with him is he's on a guaranteed salary like for three years so whether he plays or not they've got to pay him ten million dollars so if they uh they can't hardly trade him because_1 nobody wants to pay that much for him and if they just keep him that hurts their salary cap so that guy's got Dallas in a big old bind but uh they they i think they've just got to forget about him and uh try to build a team without him maybe go for some good they ought to get some good draft picks this year they've uh they've got Derek Harper that's a real good point guard him and Rolando Blackman and uh really they're about it they've got a guy named Herb Williams that that i guess sort of was supposed to take the place of uh Tarpley but he uh he just doesn't have the offensive skills and then they've got James Donaldson who's been there forever playing center and uh just all right but he's getting to where uh i don't know if it's his age or what but he just can't play the whole game they've got to get somebody young that can uh run the court that's still big oh uh not McCrae but uh let's see are you uh Perkins they traded Perkins Sam Perkins they traded him he was from North Carolina and uh they traded him to the Lakers last year and that he was a good player and then they they've got a yeah and then they they uh last year went out and got oh Fat Leever and uh Alex English and and Rodney McCrae yeah they didn't and i'm not for sure what the deal is on him i think he's been hurt but he hadn't played he hadn't played in probably two months and i've i've gone to about three or four of their games and i don't even think he was on the sidelines so i i think he hurt his knee or something but he he definitely didn't turn out to be anything like he was supposed to so uh it uh you know i i bet it was that's right that's right from uh uh Detroit that's right that's who that was yeah because_1 i don't think they got anything from Perkins i think he was a free agent or uh yeah free agent his contract ended and they didn't sign him and uh you know he was but he just went for the the big bucks i think Dallas was going to pay him like sixteen million over five years and he got something like eighteen or nineteen million from Las Angeles so he just went where the bucks were and shoot you can't blame him man that's that's a phenomenal amount of money but uh yeah the Mavericks are sucking it up i tell you uh no i don't think so they they were right before the uh uh oh what do you call i[t]- all-star break but ever since the all-star break uh shoot they've they've played terrible and uh so now it'd be really to their benefit to to really play uh some bad ball and and hopefully get a lucky uh lottery pick because_1 uh there's no way they can e[ven]- i think mathematically they're out of the play-off scene now so you know they they need to just play for a play-off pick or a you know the Suns are are pretty good they're uh yeah and they d[id]- they made some trades uh oh they had one white guy i can't think of his name that was real good white uh Chambers yeah and uh you know if if they could get somebody to help compliment him you know i think they'd be uh awesome because_1 that guy can play that Chambers is is something else but uh i don't know it'll it'll be interesting i i really don't follow the pros that close either they they just play so many games that uh you know it's just hard to keep up with them but col[lege]- i really enjoy college basketball the most no they sure didn't sure didn't oh okay so you keep up with the uh yeah more of a football powerhouse i guess more of a football powerhouse up there i guess is basketball pretty big do what i tha[t's]- that's true that is right yeah so that's a tough conference huh

okay um do you have a credit card i know i've got one um i i did have two and the i found that um it just made me spend a little more so when i paid one of them off i got rid of it now i have two only have one um i don't know i always used to be the person that would put something on and pay the bill right up and now i've after every Christmas it seems the last few Christmases i used it for Christmas and i'm still paying it off i don't know i consider myself pretty good but sometimes i can go out and i can i can over overspend my budget i guess i can afford it but it is it's a pain paying it off i i don't i don't know um i had uh i have seven hundred dollars in mine now and i've p[ut]- saved up enough money where i'm going to bring it down to two hundred and hopefully i can keep it around there yeah i know a lot of people have i mean fifteen hundred dollars two thousand dollars but um i don't know i never i never liked loans a lot so i'm not a heavy credit card user i have a girl friend that she probably has two thousand dollars on couple credit cards so i know it's easy to do especially if you if you have a job where you have to buy nice clothes and things it it i think that is the biggest problem when you really not you don't don't really need the stuff but the nicer looking clothes are the more expensive nicely tailored clothes even though you could probably get away with a cotton dress you got to go out and buy the rayon dress or something you know you got to be they say you have to dress for success yeah how many credit cards do you have that's pretty good yeah my oh my husband won't even put his name on it i don't believe in those it's like but but the time we went to Florida and needed to rent a car you know he believed in it because you've got to have a credit card to rent a car yep that's ri[ght]- up here at some sto[res]- if it's if you're not in your home town you have to show them a credit card well actually if your check bounces i guess they could legally take it off your credit card if that's why they're taking it i mean i don't know how fair that is but i don't know um yeah i guess that percentage rates are like eighteen percent yeah thirteen that's not bad yeah and yeah then you have to pay your fee and American Express you're really it's not a credit card because you have to pay it off at the end of the month but the fee for that it's really expensive isn't it i've never had one oh that's good yeah if he they they they have you pay it right out every month yeah because it's uh i know especially if your uh your reimbursement didn't come through from your company because i know they i don't know why but you can use American Express and they give you an itemized bill and you can use that i don't know why you can't use other credit cards for business that way American Express yep this is this is it actually kind a boring subject in credit cards you really you just know some people abuse them but not a joke about the person who pays their Master Card off with their Visa i bet you th[ere]- i bet you there are people that do that you go get a cash advance on one credit card to pay the other th[ey]- i think they charge more for cash advances so well it yeah you can't get cash advances oh oh well no uh it i think that's a really bad plan in your budgeting if you have to pay one card off with another oh even[tually]- eventually no it doesn't be solid for a couple of weeks then you get both bills back i know i don't credit cards almost seem unfair to a person who's who's got a victim of impulse buying like unfair advertising or something oh wow so also when you give give someone a credit card like a normal credit card like a Visa or something that that um business person loses four percent because i used to work in a business and we al[ways]- and we used to lose four percent on the credit card orders yeah it's it's the thing if if a business is taking a credit card they're really they sacrificing something too it seems the credit card company makes money all the way around because it is a four percent that they take three or four percent i don't know which put you in better rating yep because when i used to go to the bank i used to take it off the deposit you do have to take it off your deposit yeah so it is a a service that they're offering i i know should own stock there instead of these uh uh banks going that are folding but i wonder how much is numbers how many billions of dollars it's got to be billions of dollars yeah that's uh probably true i mean you have the principal debt the car loan and your house loan and then there's all the merchandise you buy on your credit cards that's personal maybe they don't yeah i know i had a girl friend she just got married out of college and the husband had t[aken]- confiscate her credit cards i mean i don't know it's probably they're always saying the women are doing are the spending ones but i haven't heard o[ne]- uh a single woman taking their credit card away from the man well i don't know um i i definitely want to get mi[ne]- up mine paid off month to month like i used to and just as soon as i get it paid off i'll probably get laid off terrible can't afford my credit card anymore	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

oh uh so wha[t's]- what's your favorite exercise oh that's pretty good exercise you do you drive a cart or do you carry your bag yeah it gets a long ways after a while yeah oh let's see i- i play racquetball mostly um i don't play very much anymore because_1 i've fractured my right ankle twice and uh fractured it on both sides and so it's kind of weak i'm afraid to get out there and try it again um do d[o]- do they give the employees time off during the day to go a lot of places do that now they'll they'll set aside you know like an hour a day that you can go exercise that's a pretty good idea because_1 people who take advantage of it end up in better health and saves them on health care um yeah i like bowling too i haven't been for a while just don't have the time but uh i guess bowling and racquetball's about it for me walking every once in a while but not a great deal of that um-hum um-hum yeah well that's my uh i mean every time i've tried to go you know it's always th[ere's]- there's always a league bowling and it it's just so you either have to wait or you're next to to league bowlers and after a while it just gets to be a pain yeah yeah especially here in Raleigh we've got such little bitty bowling alleys little bitty everything here yeah um a friend of mine works at uh IBM in Charlotte and they've got a real nice building down there on a great big piece of land and it's a huge plant i mean this thing's just enormous and that's what they do at lunch time they go out and run around the building i'm not i was never into jogging i hated that when i was in high school playing football coach was always making us run yeah i just sort of hated it from that point on well yeah it's that's a tough one to play i- i used to play it when i was younger but took it out of me then and i'd hate to think what it would do to me now yeah i got to stick to more sedate sports as soon as i as soon as i can find me an ankle a good uh a good ankle brace i'm going to start playing some racquetball again but i'm not going out there with an unsupported ankle anymore i'm tired of running around on crutches for two months at a time and i'm not lucky enough to just go ahead and break it you know the things got to get fractured so that it never heals properly well i've got a pair of those uh that's those are the ones that i wear when i go out there um trouble is i can't get them tight enough to to really give me what i feel is support um so i'm i- i- i think probably just an ace bandage would work but i want to get one of those um padded ankle what you call its yeah it's going to cut off the circulation yeah yeah i- i think i tried that one time a couple years ago and it did the same did that same thing you end up loosening it up and then of course you don't have any yeah i think i'll probably just have to go with one of those splint braces or something well i guess that's for exercise us old guys just don't do it very much do we well that's that's good exercise and i don't do enough of that either i sat down to a double dose of spaghetti tonight i um i like grilled cheese too well you know i- i- i wonder though it's i think it really depends on the person i was reading an article in the paper the other morning these doctors are baffled about this eighty seven year old man who eats thirty boiled eggs a day did you see that and they're wondering where does that cholesterol go i[t]- i think it is too And i and i think things like eggs and cheese anything like that i think it just depends on who you are because_1 uh i know people who eat tons of that kind of stuff and they're just as healthy as can be i mean i'm i'm sort of strange in a way i'm i'm about twenty pounds overweight and i smoke but my blood pressure is about my last reading was just the other day it was one hundred two over seventy nine yeah good and low and uh i mean you'd think by looking at me my i'd have a bad heart and everything terrific heart great blood pressure jeez i'm not worried about it yeah exactly and and and even then you've got to watch the bread and the water you never know what's in the water either well good talking to you you have yourself a good night talk thank you talk to you later	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well i don't know but uh i'm twenty two years old and i think it would be uh it's not a good choice to do that i mean you have uh everything here you know like uh the Army and everything else is a[ll]- all voluntary and that's the way you're going to dedicate yourself to to that you know to your job if it's voluntary i mean if you don't like it i mean if you're like in other places where they have a you know like mandatory you know uh services yeah because i mean the thing is is that whenever you i mean you seen like for example you know like the war that just went on you saw you saw that some people were not going you know people that that had all the benefits that were sitting around for years you know maybe three four years getting paid uh by the government or you know they just when the when the time came they said no way you know when they when that was their job they joined it because they wanted to or well you know some people didn't didn't have the you know the money they said it's a good way of uh i[n]- coming in but those are public service i mean you i mean you would be getting paid very little you know or anything at all and uh you would just hate it so much that whatever you had to do would be just you know it's like you know yeah i mean you wouldn't you wouldn't do it i mean the the the thing would be that it would throw you you know totally the wrong way you would be there because you had to be there but yet you would still respond to everything in a very you know negative way you know it's like do this why you know i i have a i d[on't]- i don't have to do anything you know it's like what am i going to do if i sit here if i sit here for a whole year they'll let me go and then i can get back to my life yeah well there i don't think there's any way it can you know like they say this proposal would any[where]- would get anywhere because of the i mean first of all i've never heard of it until this this phone call you know and uh if it is actually proposed and taken you know to the government or something yeah to to actually support it you know it would be just like saying that you know what a[re]- what are you crazy i mean there i mean y[ou]- i mean you know we had enough with the abortion issue that's still going around that you guys want to bring you know the next you know but see but you're going there and you know what you're getting into yeah yeah but it's it's not like saying like i'm born and then when i reached a certain age i'm going to have to do something you know it's uh it's not by choice it's like every[thing]- everything else you know it's like if i want to do it i'll do it but you know it's like you know and uh you know i have a background i'm from Argentina and uh everybody everybody that is unlucky enough has to do the military service and but you go into this whole big lottery every year and you know each uh your last three digits of your document you know like your social security number you're matched up with other numbers right from uh from uh one to a thousand and so if your number is below four hundred you're not going to have to do it say it's between four hundred and six hundred you might have to do it depending how many people are in your class and you know like you the they right and if it's above six hundred you're going to have to do it and i got one thirty one and so yeah i i didn't have to do it but the thing was that you have you know the whole the whole nation's watching you know like i[f]- if it's your class everybody that's your same age is l[istening]- listening to the radio waiting for them to announce the number you know and it's like and then you know you have people you know going you know it's like everywhere you know you have some people that are glad some people that are saying shit and the other people that are going oh my God i'm somewhere in the middle you know it's like am i going to have to do it yeah and you know but it's my brother goes everybody in my family had to do it and they go you know it's just a year and a half of your life that's that's totally wasted you don't do anything else there's no time and you don't do anything you know you go there you train you get treated like shit and then you you i mean then you get out right and so i mean but you know it's like the thing is is that you know you just get treated i mean o[ne]- one of the guys that was doing it was uh like uh a waiter at one of the restaurants that kn[ow]- you know like the military had and that was his job you know he got he got you know like three months of uh you know physical training and then he got to serve all these people you know but that's what they do i mean that's a year and a half of your life that's that you don't do anything that you have to be there you know maybe five times you know five times a week and that you know that you have a i guess a round robin schedule or something and uh no oh there i don't i don't think i don't think there is any pay wait i'm not sure because what happens is you get to like to ride buses for free well you do i guess you do get paid but the thing is is that you know people are what if they see you in the uniform right like for example y[ou]- you know like when they go around the train asking for tickets like short distant trains they won't ask you if you if you're wearing your military uniform for a ticket they'll just skip you and uh you know it's like they they consider that but it would be the same way here you know it's like i[f]- if you had to do it you know you have a big sign i'm sorry i don't get paid you it's like please let me ride for free you know it's like i'm i'm living off dad for these wonderful two years which i have to do you know it's like and then the other thing is when i get out of college at twenty eight with my you know it's like by the time yeah and so that would be that would be see there're too many things that go against it that would be ridiculous so oh well it's been seven minutes i don't i d[on't]- well i don't i don't think they'll ever pass this i i i'm just going to laugh if i ever see it in the newspapers i i mean i don't read the newspaper that much but i never heard anything about it so so and but then you won't have to do it just imagine sometimes your kids you'll be saying well it's your job go do it you know but i[t]- yeah really then you'll have to say see in my age i didn't have to do it oh really dad yeah oh well okay yeah bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

hey Dick who's your favorite team oh how come oh yeah yeah yeah they really uh uh they found out that all the guys that were backing up uh McMahon when they got to be the first guys weren't all that good after all yeah yeah and or they found that Tomczak really wasn't a he was a good backup quarterback was what he was yeah yeah he wasn't the guy to take them take them to the championship yeah i don't i don't know what's out there for quarterbacks and they've got a what about a mid a mid first round choice i think yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Steve Walsh yeah he had had had sort of mixed success with them uh when he was there but well i i think once he goes into training camp with them and gets a full year at uh to do it it it'll work out okay for him i uh you know i uh he didn't have a chance here in Dallas because my gosh Aikman was the number one choice number one draft choice uh and with a long term six year contract and they were paying him a lot of money so Walsh yeah Walsh didn't have that much uh well as you probably guessed i'm a Cowboy fan uh more or less and well it's hard uh because yeah uh i was here in nineteen sixty well i got to go back that i moved down from Pittsburgh in in fifty nine and uh in fifty eight i really became a pro football fan went to all the Steelers home games and they finished second that year i guess and it was Bobby Lane's first it was the year that Bobby Lane got traded to them two games into the season uh so that's where i started cutting my teeth on the NFL and then i got to Dallas and we didn't have any NFL in fifty nine so i sat and watched uh watched it on television then at the end of the fifty nine season when they announced we're gonna get a team in sixty i went out and bought two season tickets and i was in the first twelve season ticket holders for the Cowboys uh yeah except i don't use them uh then what happened so we go a little bit further than that uh and i uh uh i was single then later i got married and i had my two season tickets and they were in the Cotton Bowl in the first row in the upper deck on the fifty yard line uh which was really nice and uh in the early days uh you know ten twelve fourteen thousand people i'm talking about sixty through about sixty four uh was what we got i also bought season tickets to the Dallas Texans football team which is now the Kansas City Chiefs and i and i may have been the only one that did both because the mentality in Dallas was that you couldn't like both you had to like one and hate the other and and it was interesting because the AFL uh when when the Chiefs when the Texans were playing they would give the scores of the Cowboy games and the NFL games but the NFL refused to admit they existed so when the Cowboys were playing you never got the scores of their games and it you know it was the Lamar Hunt crowd versus the Clint Murchison crowd and uh and the the popular joke around Dallas was that after the sixty two season uh in fact i went down to Houston in sixty two and watched them win the AFL championship uh after the sixty two season Murchison and Hunt got together and flipped a coin and the loser had to and uh then in uh uh sixty uh uh let's see sixty nine when they decided to build the new stadium in Irving uh they let the uh uh they let the fans build it i mean it wasn't built with any tax payer money uh they floated bonds that the that the season ticket holders had to buy to maintain their status as season ticket holders so what was neat is you got to choose the tickets based on your seniority as a season ticket holder and uh so i had a first choice and uh i got in the upper tier uh well actually there was two types of seats there were two hundred and fifty dollar bonds and thousand dollar bonds that you had to and so i got the first choice of the two hundred and fifty dollar bonds so i was in the upper deck in the twelfth row on the fifty yard line i wonder if that guy that's in the eleventh row see he bought thousand dollar that guy so uh that happened then uh ultimately i had uh i got transferred overseas by T[I]- i'm with TI and i got transferred overseas uh through most of the eighties so i ea[ch]- each year i just sold my t[ickets]- i had some people take custody of my tickets for me i served uh three year[s]- four years in Malaysia and three in the Philippines and uh now i got back i got kids in college and gosh i can't afford that price so i still keep them in my name but the guy who takes them calls me every year and says can i have the tickets one more year i say yeah fine take them so i still hold them but i don't go but uh the the funny thing about the Cowboys is is that everybody is really enthused because we've got all these umpteen jillion draft choices and uh but when you look back on the team uh uh except for probably Emmett Smith nobody that's been drafted in the last twelve years is a starter well if you don't make smart selections it doesn't do any good or if you make smart selections and they and you can't sign them yeah well i heard Jerry Jones say something interesting and i and i it must border on legality or ethnicity on draft day he's got about thirty people that are going out to their potential players and when it comes their time to choose they get thirty minutes or so these people will negotiate with the players and get them to sign a contract and if they won't sign a contract they won't draft them and and they will take the time allotted to make their choices to do that and uh uh yeah because see last year their first two draft choices were uh Alex uh Emmett Smith and Alexander Wright and they didn't get either of them until half way through the season and they didn't get to go through training camp with them yeah Smith came on pretty good Wright is is still in the in the potential category everybody likes his speed but he can't catch the ball no no no but but you know that's where Bob Hayes was in his early days too so hum oh yeah yeah well those were the glory years the seventies were absolutely yeah and and and and and the seventies were really a it it saw the team's emergence as a super power coincided with the movement to Texas Stadium uh and the movement to Texas Stadium came along about the fifth game of uh of the seventy one season and that was the year they went to the Super Bowl and beat Miami in the Super Bowl the previous year that they'd finished in the Cotton Bowl they did go to the Super Bowl and got beat by Baltimore in in the in the last second or two but uh i mean in the seventies it was play-offs every year oh yeah there's so many people do that yeah yeah yeah well i own four tick[ets]- i might i told you i had two i actually own four and in seventy one the year they moved into the stadium i bought two more because i had uh two children and they were very little and we just ended up taking the neighbors kids who were teenagers because our i thought that ultimately my own would want to go and the way the stadium was selling out in season tickets it might be totally sold out which it never did but uh uh at twenty nine dollars a pop now let's see six four's is uh-huh that's a hundred and sixteen dollars and another five for parking so that's a hundred and twenty one dollars and with two kids in college and the potential of having three there next September uh i you know i'm going to watch them on television for a few years uh boy they don't have one uh yeah they they sure they sure found out in a hurry that Babe Wassenberg wasn't it didn't they yeah but you know it's it's interesting because old uh uh you know everybody said when they signed Steve Wal boy they're going to have to trade him they're going to have to trade him but you cannot seriously contend uh in the league without two front line quarterbacks and and and you know the years that we were good we had Staubach and Morton now the one that wasn't playing the one that wasn't playing was pissed off most of the time but nevertheless in in over three or four seasons both those guys went down with with severe injuries and the other guy stepped in and they didn't never lost a lick yeah yeah huh yeah yeah and uh that last championship they won in the Super Bowl Craig Martin was the only guy in the entire squad that did not get in the game but he got his winner's share	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay so uh what do you think about it privacy right well there is always the uh the possibility even remote as it is of uh of mistaken uh of yeah and see that bothers me i'm i'm a i mean i'm i'm very much for drug testing uh i really am i mean i'm going i'm going to take the negative side just for a second just to do it um see i have to take uh medication for a uh for for kidney transplant and i'm going to be taking that the rest of my life now you i don't know how that's going to affect uh right i mean i haven't had one yet um TI i work for Texas Instruments and and uh we you know we do have the random drug testing but i've missed it so far but i mean it in the back of my mind it always bothers me and what happens if it you know if it if they catch it they think that i'm you know i'm on drugs and they send me and and have me uh you know go through this this thing you know yeah right um-hum oh yeah um-hum no yeah right um-hum right well i you know i'm like i said i'm i'm very much pro testing um and and this is why uh number one is i i'm i'm kind of i know this sounds like a slogan for the government but i you know we are in a war against drugs i mean it's it's horrible i mean you don't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not and it takes some drastic steps at this point and i think personally the drastic step has to be that um that you can't work if you continue taking drugs i mean it's as simple as that i mean make it so well make it uh ma[ke]- not necessarily difficult but make it so that it's not glamorous i mean it's glamorous taking drugs or at least it seems that way yeah um-hum um-hum um-hum hum right right um-hum well then let's let's answer the second half of the question what limits ought to be put on it do you think um-hum um-hum treatment before for dismissal type thing um-hum um-hum right um-hum personally i think that's what i was about to say is that everyone needs to be tested that it could happen um-hum right well there's yeah there there's going to be some measure of incentive uh reward or whatever but the reward u[ltimately]- ultimately comes down to what you want so i i've got to agree with that so um hum yeah i think so i think i think we did pretty good well all right well uh i guess that's about it all right it was it was talk nice talking to you too all right bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
okay well uh what do you think about taxes do you think we're paying too much um-hum yeah yeah how true yeah well gasoline especially in this part of the country we all use it all the time you know it's that's not what i would consider a luxury yeah well um i- i think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we're getting for it and how it's being managed and so forth i mean i- i think there could be a better system and we would get more for our money it's totally out of our hands so we don't we can't really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes and and but not really yeah well i think too one of the things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by Congress and that don't seem to have any validity at all i mean they're always far out and uh you know they're studying some obscure uh bug or some such thing and and our tax money pays for those things and i think that's wrong i that's right yeah and i think here lately they've been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize that we're the nation in trouble the war um-hum yeah and i think that's a mistake somewhere somewhere you know we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away we know what trouble they got into yeah well i- i think another thing too that um i've had a little contacted with uh in regard to taxes let's say that um you have something that the IRS disagrees with or you know says hey we're not going to allow that well i think they're very unfair in the amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because you you will not only pay back that that you wrote off but you will at least double that amount and yes and that's to me there's something wrong there you know yeah i mean i can see paying the interest and some small penalty but they really stick it to you big time um-hum absolutely um-hum yeah that's a lot well i haven't counted i- i would have guessed eight even but you might be right i don't have any idea yeah wow yeah yeah yeah well i- i have another thing that i thought about too um for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is and you know we're not typically talking about big dollars but here you feel like you've you've done something good you've you've earned your interest and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it so the real amount of your savings on that is is not much you know it's kind of a vicious circle there and then they took that away as far as being yeah huh-uh well you can come over to my house and spend it i wish i had some to spend no no i don't i just don't have yeah that's the way it goes well i guess we probably talked just about long enough yeah yes uh-huh i don't know you too okay good-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
well i haven't uh you know when the war was on i watched um CNN and um Nightline pretty regularly and read the paper and all but when uh lately like the last week or two i guess with Easter and spring break with the kids i um i hadn't been thinking much about the Middle East and what's going on over there have you been keeping up uh-huh uh hum start it there's no official document signed or anything well i um when the when the crisis began last August i began to think well i i um couldn't remember things that i had studied in the past in school and all so i got out like my encyclopedias and tried to read about the history and it it was really what i felt was kind of cynical because it there just hasn't been any peace over there ever in thousands of years of history yeah that's right and it just it's just not people they and it's not uh you know there isn't any real Arab coalition because they do fight among themselves and they fight with each other and they have such hatred for uh Israel and oh yes hum oh no he and got it over with well i just there's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace and um with and that i'm afraid that we would have to stay uh-huh uh-huh right yeah yes yes right right right yeah right right well i just uh i'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go in and call the shots like you say an[d]- and i just would prefer that i mean sometimes we've said let's keep we're not interested in what other countries do and then other times we jump in and do things and while i'm really glad that they uh i it was important to de[militarize]- demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments i don't ho[pe]- i hope we don't try to keep uh in there and try to keep our fingers in the pot and try to stay over there because we just don't want to send our people there and make them stay yeah yeah yeah and yeah uh-huh i noticed that well i don't think there's much hope for a lasting peace over there like they yeah history uh-huh no no well i guess i better go i have a repairman just came for my refrigerator but yes well i enjoyed the topic i hope you ha[ve]- have a good day okay bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i don't know um do you do a lot of camping yeah oh so yeah um up here some of the state parks are really nice and some of them aren't some of them_1 are pretty rough um yeah they they just have like outhouses they don't have like a shower room or anything yeah but some of them_1 are really nice they have showers and full bathrooms um but i don't know i i've been camping a couple times but i'm not a real avid camper uh a lot of people i know are but um i don't i don't know that yeah in fact we went we went once to a lean-to and it um i mean there wasn't any electricity on the camp site but it was all right but we only spent two nights there i wouldn't want to spend more than two nights i wouldn't want to go for like a but um two nights is good um especially there was a little store close by so it was pretty nice oh really oh um yeah up here you got to wait till Au[gust]- August till the water warms well it's not that bad but it's still pretty chilly um i don't know i was i have a tent and i slept out in it in the backyard and stuff but the th[ing]- thing about camping that bothers me is you've got to pack everything and another thing is the thing seems to get it's you know so you can't keep the dirt out of the tent and i don't know we have a seven year old it's pretty funny like stay out boy he he doesn't go in and out of the tent a hundred times and use it as a play uh they they like to play in them_1 yeah i don't know yeah well w[hat]- what we were doing we were just going to say we're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night so you know no going in and out and or what what he wants to do we had brought his friend along was play in the tent it was like no this is not you can't do that you get tent all dirty plus you get it all wet because_1 we were at a beach site too n[o]- no but you know i was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because_1 th[ey]- they are really nice and um up here we have uh we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime yeah they're terrible they're really terrible uh but there is this one campsite that it that some of them_1 are known that there is one that's out in this big lake and it's it's it's mosquitoes are terrible and then this uh there's this other one that's more up in the mountains but it surrounds a man-made reservoir and there's no bugs that's the whole thing that everyone told me oh i'm i was going to go to Little Little River State Park they go oh that place is great there's no bugs but oh okay because uh we were having a b[ig]- a really big problem up here in certain areas we were really affected that bad but really bad it um almost destroyed the the tourism in one town because of the mosquitoes they're so bad yeah that was it's a really nice area i've been there before and it's i i couldn't imagine ge[t]- living just sixty miles north of them but they were plagued they were plagued with them with mosquitoes and you can go out outside in the daytime all right but the minute the sun went down that's when it seems like the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out i mean just the very second it's really strange they uh they must uh work on that you know the the it gets cooler when the sun sets and then they all come out oh oh yeah yeah i never really noticed how effective they were but um because that wasn't really i- i bought them_1 and i didn't really get to use them_1 like oh there's mosquitoes let's turn them on we just sort of lit them and um we weren't bothered that much by mosquitoes so we didn't really contribute it to that but um i think in an area that's really thick with mosquitoes i can't see all this little uh smoke buckets i call how they work but they they're suppose to work really well oh i'm in my paperwork here that's what i do when i wait for a phone call i get in my paperwork oh to find my most important parts but i don't know i don't know if i'm going to go g[o]- i wish i was an avid camper and i could really talk about like gardening or something i can talk about that a lot but um i do want to go again we just moved to a new hou[se]- into a house so i don't see camping maybe in the backyard but i don't see going on a camping trip probably till next summer so it's easy for you to go um oh God i don't know but that sounds like my k[ind]- my kind of camping it really does yeah okay um well um tha[t]- that is the best way to do it is to have a a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it plus your tent yep um well those they're kind of nice but they're also um flimsy when you really look at them_1 but then when you get inside they're really nice you know everything's really but then when you look underneath it it's just got these little wheels and this just this uh little axle it's like oh my and then a big windstorm it would pick you up oh jeez yeah what do you what do you do when you get a i mean like a really violent storm like a tornado just stay in your truck i i mean i wouldn't stay in the um oh so d[id]- were they successful but it took them_1 a little while yeah so did they get stuck yeah huh wow so they evacuated it wow yeah i know i i always i like to like to get right on the water yeah where the campsite i[t's]- so i[t]- w[ell]- like i don't know we have lean-to's up here i really like them_1 like they say they're kind of it's kind of more dirty than anything you know just just yeah they're they're lean-to's they're um yeah they're pretty nice they're they're uh it's like a little house except the whole face is open and the one time that we went we got one it was overlooking the water but it was a big embankment i wanted to get one right on the water that was then when we had uh an electrical storm too and it was really it was neat sitting there watching it i mean it was raining when we called in home everybody said oh we were worried about you in that storm	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well i wondered if i was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this to[pic]- was afraid we might get into an argument well uh i guess uh there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations for uh the roles of women and uh i guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now and trying to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities you know they may be going to school or may have elderly parents or you know all sorts of other things oh i think so absolutely i- i i think it's extremely difficult to keep up with all that uh we have to these sometimes i think i am going crazy trying to do it but yes uh yes they are getting older now so they are not quite as much of a responsibility but they are still there you know they still take time and and i you know i still provide most of the the things that go on around the house so uh yeah and for a while i was going to school to and tha[t]- it was tough um-hum but in some ways i think we are expected to do it all you're almost looked down upon if you don't try to do all of these things and that's where the problem is really uh-huh uh-huh yeah right yeah yeah it's a tough one i mean i've done some of both i when my kids were real little i was at home for a couple of different periods of time oh i think the longest was less than a year but still at least i was able to to spend you know those first months with them but uh i mostly went back to work because i was tired of doing without things you know the money was the issue but uh even now i would i would like to not have to work in some ways it it's a kind of pull and tug on the other hand i can't imagine just being at home uh although i have a lot of interests and a lot of things i would like to pursue uh still uh there's there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having you know a job and all that goes with that oh um-hum yeah yeah yeah that's a good deal where do you think this is going in the future i mean do you think things are going to change or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this yeah um-hum i don't yeah i well i see i think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children uh and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the the family things work uh but i don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers you know It's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are i don't know if they want to completely give that up but it would be nice if there could be an in-between a middle ground somewhere yeah well yeah i think they they like a routine of sorts well yes i i like the fact that you know gradually you're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions but it's still a long way from being what it ought to be yeah okay well i enjoyed talking to you all right good-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well do you own a PC oh wow what processor does it have in it oh what kind of work do you do on it oh okay yeah huh yeah i don't own a PC but i've i've yeah i work for TI and uh they well i have uh pretty fa[irly]- a fairly fancy one it's a TI model it's an S P one thousand which has a it has a fast processor in it a three eighty six and i the the job that i do i do a lot of training of our customers for new products and i have to develop uh functional specs and do some desk desk top publishing and everything so it's it's kind of fun i mean i i i always say that i need to buy a computer for the house but i just haven't got around to doing it yet your husband what what group is your husband in oh DSEG defense systems and electronics group i see yeah oh okay yeah i work on uh printers and the peripheral products division basically uh i work in the airline ma[rketing]- marketing group so we we do a lot of oh yeah uh-huh yeah is he a programmer i see uh-huh right right really so uh does uh your husband ever use uh a laptop or a notebook does he bring a little one home with him or uh-huh oh i see yeah we we build uh laptop and notebook computers here in Temple also and those are really handy i mean we they they have modems in them you can send a fax from your PC but they're they're really what's that yeah they're they're pretty handy because you know when i travel it's easy to check messages just you know plug in the phone to your computer and dial in and oh okay yeah i just found out i'm going to Denver Sunday night again so that kind of reeks havoc with plans but it it's really not enough to become a big hassle but i see well i don't know there you can get well depends on what you consider expensive i mean you can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars where you know just a few years ago it would have been six seven eight nine thousand dollars yeah it's still i mean you know two thousand dollars isn't just just pocket change to a lot of people yeah yeah when i started at uh TI i was a summer development student and and finishing up at school and so those papers really i mean it was nice having access to the equipment to uh yeah well how many different types of packages do you use uh-huh oh okay yeah golly i've got up up at work anyway i use uh WordPerfect and Lotus and GemDraw which is a uh uh a a line draw package yeah you probably use D base or something like that for your uh data entry stuff that your talking about hm do you get to do you work at home all the time or just uh-huh oh that that was that worked out pretty good then uh-huh yeah so it keeps you in the company huh uh-huh yeah boy i tell you if i could bring a computer home and do stuff here i'd get all kinds of stuff phone's always ringing and people always asking me to do something else i've got a lot of especially right now we've got several new products coming out and i've got lots of documentation i need to review and some i need to revise and well yeah but you know i need to be at the office too you know i've just got to deal with all those other things that happen but a PC at the house would really take a lot of the load off uh-huh well i've i've done that before on a couple times but that would make it just that much easier instead of bringing home a computer you just bring home a few floppy disks you know my man that sounds really nice uh-huh uh-huh right yeah i've got a lot of folks that i've worked with like that as well yeah we we sort of stayed to the topic anyway okay well we'll talk to you later bye	0 0 0 0

that was twenty minutes yeah i- i thought they gave up after a little while but i'm sure glad you were home i think we're going to discuss why we think uh uh so few people vote in national elections and even fewer in local elections and that's what we're going to talk about okay and uh uh uh okay where do you work Karen oh okay how did you get h[ow]- h[ow]- yeah how did you get in the program oh that's neat they both work in Sherman yeah i work in TI in Dallas here how many calls have you been in on this year oh i don't know i haven't been i- i hope the computer keeping track of them because i'm not well oh i do too i- i just really i- i try to get in one a night if somebody doesn't call me i call somebody okay you -[ab]ou[t]- you about_1 ready oh okay huh oh well it's funny you should say something like that because uh i'm from Dallas for thirty two years i was from New England originally but i don't have a New England accent oh my parents have a New England accent but i don't oh it's northern well i've been i've been everywhere i've lived overseas for TI for ten years uh four four years in Malaysia rather seven years and three years in the Philippines and i lived in Pittsburgh before i came here i was raised in New England so it's but i've been here thirty two years so i sort of consider myself a Texan i got a no i've got a i've got a Texan wife and three Texan children right where where you native Karen yeah yeah where what part of Texas oh okay now i- i- i ask that because my wife is from the Palestine area in East Texas and you can tell she's native too yeah right right well i'm going to push one and let them start recording okay okay Karen uh you know it always has amazed me and in fact i think i wrote a paper on this in college uh that the national elections uh just have so few people voting in them_1 you know uh maybe uh fifty percent or less of the electorate have you ever thought much about it did how do you vote how do you vote in the military do you vote absentee in your own registered state um-hum yeah we don't have a state income tax right from that state um-hum um-hum yeah right i'm going to inject a little side anecdote for you back to the to the uh uh the main topic here because it it you might be interested in this uh you know i've i've uh as i mentioned i've had seven years of ex[patriate]- expatriate service with TI and uh you vote in the embassy uh uh from whatever country you're in you go to the United States Embassy and vote there and uh i was in the Phi[llipines]- uh in Portugal not stationed there but i was i was there on business and visiting a family uh that i knew very well in fact the guy had been my boss when we were in Malaysia and uh it was with with TI and i went to his house for dinner and they had a young son who was probably about in the seventh grade and was attending a British school in uh uh in Portugal and this was in uh this was just nineteen eighty four just uh prior maybe in the summer prior to the eighty four election and i went home uh for dinner to dinner with this fellow and they were they were Texans and uh they lived there in Portugal and his wife said gee the darndest thing happened today she said i'm so embarrassed she said i was over at Reed's school and Margaret Thatcher came and spoke to the to the uh the parents it was a British school so she was there visiting in Portugal and she visited this British school and spoke to parents and after it was over she said i went up to her and i said Mrs Thatcher i'm a great admirer of yours and she said what i wanted to uh uh i've always wanted to meet you and i've enjoyed this opportunity to meet you and uh Margaret Thatcher said oh you're you're an American yes she said well something i want to ask you about she said when you're American and away from home in an election year like this how do you vote and and my friend said oh if nothing changes i'll vote for Reagan and she said oh my goodness no i didn't mean that and poor Janet realized immediately she didn't mean that she meant what was the process of voting and Margaret Thatcher was embarrassed that Janet would think that she was going to ask her and her husband kept looking at her and said i can't believe you could be so dumb but uh i it's it's interesting though people that do we've had noticed we had been uh uh in Malaysia during one election year and the Philippines in another that there seems to be a higher percent of the expatriate population i mean well over fifty percent that do bother to to register with the embassy and go vote you'd almost think that you think you're more important when you're out of the country and you're exposed to some things um-hum yeah true that's exactly right and they don't realize that that it's all {onesies} and the {onesies} all add up you know the thing that that i surprised me even more you know if we got a good contest going uh we do manage to get fifty percent out in national elections and uh but what's even worse is the off year congressional elections uh when there's not a presidential election uh and the local election and it bothers me and i- i think that's even more important to vote in those because uh oh sure and yeah and it's it's like a school board election you know those of us with children in school are very concerned about what goes on uh in the school system yet uh school board members are elected with sometimes ten to fifteen percent of the electorate turning out an[d]- yeah and and you know the one of the things that i can still remember a college professor standing up pointing his pipe at a class one day while he was lecturing and he said the problem of the vote is that the American uh public is sometimes asked to go to the polls too often and to make too many and too difficult decisions and i think of that every time i go find one of these ballots and you not only get it in the presidential year uh where where you go down through eight or nine judgeships and uh uh what oh yeah it it still is your responsibility right yeah i yeah i- i- i think you're right there and i'm glad you mentioned the League of Women Voters i've i don't know how long they've been around maybe a long time but it's only in my more mature years that i have become aware of them and and i make a real effort to go out and read all and particularly read their things about the candidates for lesser offices that you don't you can't read their view in the paper uh and i- i think that is tremendously important and	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

oh right up in uh TI out there oh right yeah i just hit one then uh it i- i got to uh this is going to be fun are you Republican or Democrat okay well i was i was i'm a Democrat so i was going to say if you're a Republican boy we would really have a good time well i uh to answer that one before we get to our subject you know i always get a kick out of Republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was though when it comes to the budget they say well the Democrats control all the money and they're the ones wasting all the money and i always wondered how they can play the money either way they want you know i get a kick out of that but anyway the subject go ahead you first yeah i uh i don't think it's over i think that uh so many other things have taken over uh in the media but i think it was just plain greed and i think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks go ahead loan your money out you know yeah i was talking to someone i can't remember who it was but he was a small businessman and he said that the banks were calling he borrowed some money and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away they just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property and uh yeah there there there should be thousands of people in jail as far as i'm concerned not just a couple right well i i agree a hundred percent oh yeah it may have started with HUD too i noticed that HUD was in terrible shape and that was property and uh they lost a lot of money there and then some of these big these rich people started to even uh Murchison here who owned the Cowboys had a lot of property down in Florida this was several years ago and he lost you know all all of his money before he died not all of it i don't know how much he lost but uh they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit and it always would it always would increase you know it always would uh uh be more than what you paid for it and they just never even got conservative with our money at all right yeah well now the reason that i said that is because i was going to blame all uh {Reaganomics} for you know you spend your way to prosperity and when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls i thought well that was the philosophy you know just keep spending until taxes are lower and i thought that's not going to work you know and i knew that it wasn't going to work originally and it hasn't worked now you know right no doubt no doubt oh yeah i i i agree with that but there's got to be some control and apparently there was you know yeah yeah yeah yeah i know uh oh no i right and and not high quality ones at that you know well i do have a lot of confidence in the the American people and the economy and everything else i i feel bad when i see the inefficiency even here at TI you know and i think that the it it still a lot of the workers don't understand that uh they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them you know right i i know and and i when i of course i'm in facilities and i work with a lot of mechanics and i just cannot understand why they're just happy to spend their time here rather than produce you know and they think that well i'm paid anyway so it doesn't matter you know right right yeah oh really you don't sound like a nonexempt Jim you don't sound like a nonexempt uh you're too informed they're they're very they're very uh not interested they wouldn't even talk probably about some of the things we're talking about now i guess i'm dealing with too many Texas mechanics here i don't know really i'm i'm being a Yankee i guess i'm i'm letting my Yankee come out you know yeah uh well that's good no right i mean that's good that you're degreed uh uh uh your time will come there we uh i know a few people that would oh really what are you in a tech like do you do tech[nician]- technician work or something or oh quality okay yeah oh yeah well now is is uh really terrible i- i'm uh management level uh facilities and when the cuts came three of us got uh bounced back and so we're just uh i'm calling you from work i- i- i- i'm i'm covering uh weekends and nights now i'm i'm one of the manager reps there's three of us to cover in Dallas facilities and just we're essentially standby and problems uh all all nights and weekends that's my i only get one weekend off a month right now i call it my recession job uh being basically an engineer and liking uh doing installation work well there's not any i mean there literally is no installation work going on yeah yeah yeah it it banking i think that not not only TI but a lot of it when they talk about uh there was one point i was going to make i think the last i heard and i i have to admit i'm not as informed uh that much but there's something like eighty six billion that they admit well i always double that i figure well if they claim that it's going to cost us eighty six billion it's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes and so if that's true it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was that went down the tube somewhere yeah it's amazing really it's amazing that oh yeah i know what you mean course your value of homes up there are pretty good i mean here they're not really that high but are they pretty good up there oh really well we're in the metroplex here you know and uh it it i die every time companies like General Dynamics they they lost several contracts and and i don't know if you noticed yesterday you probably don't pay attention to the Bell Helicopter you know they were going to have this big uh award and Secorski got it which was Boeing Secorski this which is up in the north somewhere you know and i don't know how Bell didn't get it well i i don't i they were advertising here that it was Bell TI TI was getting the uh electronics with Bell and so it was a double one that Bell is in the Metroplex and two that TI was doing the electronics for them and they they uh advertised that that it was TI Bell TI Bell and then all of a sudden Secorski got it yeah Secorski Boeing Boeing doesn't need the money something i almost think there's some politics around here because the metroplex here in the Dallas Fort Worth area the uh with TI i don't know if TI has lost as much as everybody else but General Dynamics and LTV and Bell have lost project after project you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

well uh i am basically retired now i was a member i was in education and in administration so basically i wore dresses and uh heels and i was never one uh because my work often took me into court uh never was one that got uh accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work but that was just me i know many people are co[mfortable]- very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants uh it i guess i was just old enough not to uh be very comfortable in it how about_1 you oh um-hum um-hum yes and i think that does make a difference because when you do have to be in front of people uh i think you the the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and and uh more classical style of clothing what about the miniskirt um-hum well there are miniskirts and there are miniskirts there are some that are really short and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee and again it depends upon the size the shape of the person as well as the shape of the person's legs now i also uh even though i retired from education i uh i do modeling and i teach at a modeling agency here and uh so when we are doing {wardrobing} and we have uh two two hour classes in wardrobe we do discuss a great deal the miniskirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job uh even though i may have them from sixth grade on up through uh grandmothers in my class and uh way i always try to emphasize the clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad because maybe they those are not the clothes that are the most uh appealing to you or the most um complimentary to you but uh the miniskirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want and and then uh then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy that's right well i- i uh i have to agree with that even when they was very very popular in the early sixties uh i uh uh again maybe because i was at the school there were still many teachers who wore miniskirts uh we had no regulation against it and a lot of the kids did of course and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those miniskirts and so i think uh uh of course now i go the other extreme i do not like to see in the corporate areas uh all the women dressed like men with the suits and uh white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same uh i don't like that i don't i think there should be individuality in dressing yes right well i and i don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to to look professional i think that you you make of that what you wish and you can go the opposite direction and uh overdo all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which don't belong in the uh at least in my opinion in the workplace uh but that that you can have a classical look without a lot of a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine because that was one thing i always fought against i started out as a physical education teacher so i was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or mannish uh and people would never ever guess that i was phys ed and um and that pleased me uh and uh so then i of course just continued what i considered the best style of clothing for me at work and uh and i find even even at home here now i- i will wear blue jeans or i'll wear shorts and what have you uh and be very comfortable but when i go out somewhere then uh unless i have a pair of dress slacks i don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans i have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how and so uh uh i just feel that uh you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort but uh there are certain norms that companies should be able to uh put out as guidelines for their employees right yes yes yes that's good yeah um-hum yes right right right yeah yeah well i don't either unfortunately i don't have to work in those companies but uh i- i uh did have a group come over from one of the banks over the children's hospital where i was volunteering and uh they were doing a presentation and every one of the young execs coming up were dressed exactly alike men and women they all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or sla[cks]- or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie i mean you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants and one was a skirt and one was a pant and uh and i think that's sad because that doesn't allow for any individuality that's uh can stifle creativity so i guess so well it's been nice talking with you uh-huh bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

are you in the new car market right now i'm not looking right now but i have been considering what i would purchase uh in the near future um well i'm getting in th[e]- in my mid thirties now i'm looking more for a uh kind of a luxury sedan i guess i'm driving a two door coupe sport coupe right now and i'm getting a little tired of it yeah a little bigger and i haven't uh really been out looking at cars uh uh it's something i would possibly consider uh-huh right i don't know i've been told to check out the uh Acura Legend first though and i guess they're made by Honda as well it's the uh luxury line of the Hondas i think uh-huh yeah i do need something that gets a little better mileage than what i'm getting getting right now i get about thirteen miles per gallon now i've been uh leaning more towards looking at uh Mercedes Benzes say four or five years old not the new cars but uh ones that are more affordable they tend to be very reliable and uh people that uh own them uh typically have them serviced on a regular maintenance schedule i think they're kept in uh better condition than uh most other cars uh-huh yeah they don't change style very often i like that uh-huh if you were to buy uh a new car right now what factors would d[o]- you consider uh looking at to make you decision uh-huh i find that price is always the governing govern[ing]- governing factor uh regardless of what else you're looking at so it's difficult to buy something that's out of your price range something that you can't afford uh-huh well i ye[ah]- i drive a Pontiac right now and i've had very good luck with it uh no problems i'm just changing my preference for what type of car i'd like to drive in the future yeah eventually i'd like to do something like that get out out of uh uh driving this uh teenage teenage automobile sure well there are cars that teens absolutely -[wi]ll refuse to drive uh-huh do you prefer buying uh cars new from uh dealerships or uh buying used cars from individuals right but don't you feel intimidated by talking to a car salesman okay well that's great if they can make you feel at ease that's pretty good right they certainly are and they try to take advantage of uh the consumer's ignorance towards automobiles yeah if they sense that you're really interested and that's the car for you they're whe[n]- they're negotiating position is that they're going to get as much money out of you as they can with as many options piled on sure well you tend to do a lot better on selling a used car as an individual placing an ad in the paper as opposed to trading it in at a dealership sure well i've found that any car that runs is basically in demand and uh you can go pretty much by the blue book value or by uh comparison uh listings yeah um-hum yeah uh yeah i agree with you on that well i'm not sure i'm i'm just uh kind of thinking about it and haven't really made any uh decisions or commitments on it well i drive a black car right now and i've always liked black but uh i maybe uh interested in other colors uh i'm not really interested in yellow or white but i've always had a preference for red and black and uh well it's just something i'd have to think about depended on it depends on which uh what cars are available oh no i would uh go to the want ads in the paper and uh find one that would meet my uh needs well may[be]- maybe sometime soon i don't know probably not this year i think i need to concentrate more on getting a paint job for the car that i have right now and just keeping it in uh good operating condition yeah well that's the point it isn't costing me any money right now it's running uh very well and i haven't had car payments for seven years i enjoy that immensely i'm driving a nineteen eighty Trans AM the only trouble i have with it is with insurance companies they don't want to insure it just because it's a sporty model has nothing to do with driving record i have no accidents or tickets and uh they're very reluctant uh yet even to insure that car yeah well my insurance agent told me that uh when when i uh bought a new car or whe[n]- when i more specifically when i bought my Honda to give him a call because then he wou[ld]- he would make me a good deal on an insurance policy but i haven't really no intention of buying a Honda it uh well it's it's more like an economy car and uh i'd be looking more of uh more for a luxury sedan something with a little more status i really don't consider it to be a status symbol uh it's just uh i'm interested i know people who have cars of that nature and uh they tend to hold their quality and hold their value uh and they're just very attractive automobiles as far as i'm concerned	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well uh i don't have a lot of time to watch TV this is not a good subject um i when the little bit of time i do get to spend because i'm in school in the evenings um uh i like to watch movies and comedies and uh i watch the news and the only game type shows that i ever watch are Wheel Of Fortune how about you well yeah i know oh i haven't watched it in ages but uh you know oh yes i didn't get a chance to see that uh-huh uh-huh oh yes yes they are they i love those but they unfortunately they don't have nearly enough of those those and the National Geographic ones specials those those are great too yeah i know what you mean uh-huh well you know it interesting they have a new one out have you ever watched Ex[pose]- Expose uh that's kind of one along the line of Sixty Six[ty]- i mean that excuse me Twenty Twenty and uh yeah Sixty Minutes but uh uh i've only watched it once uh like i said i've been in class and uh so during the week uh i don't have much time and i spend a lot of time with uh my daughter on the weekend and she lives a way away so uh i'm you we're not usually watching TV but uh but it is interesting uh they this time of year unfortunately it gets kind of most of them are reruns and you know stuff like that that's why i kind of stick to the movies if they're good uh that one sounds good though that was on last night i didn't get a chance to i didn't get home till ten so yeah uh-huh i've heard of it i haven't watched it uh uh-huh uh-huh yeah uh-huh i was just going to say usually twist it oh uh-huh right oh my gracious -[s]o what did he do then ooh yeah well then they couldn't retry her oh oh uh-huh oh my good yeah oh oh yes i don't watch her anymore not after that Star Spangled Banned thing uh-huh i've never watched that either i have watched that yeah that's good yeah it's a nice way to relax i mean in a way i mean i find it anyway although sometimes watching the news isn't very relaxing i get home from from class and everything and turn on the TV and watch the news early news and it's like uh i i didn't really need to watch that before i go to yeah well see that was that's another if i would have been home probably wouldn't have watched it because i have class tonight and i would have missed the second half and that's the most because that's you know you can if you missed the first half you can kind of catch up they catch you up you know with the second one but if you miss the second half you've missed the you know outcome and oh it's frustrating no i don't unfortunately we have cable but that's one thing i need to we had one but it broke down so uh i haven't gotten another one because i haven't you know i haven't even rented movies to because yeah yeah but uh but pe[rhaps]- perhaps when it's over i will y[ou]- you know i o[f]- course right well that's it i but i have gotten we have cable and so um that's yeah sometimes i spend a lot of time on that some movies that i would never have gone and seen uh you know have turned out to be really good movies uh you know you hate to spend the money on them espec[ially]- as expensive as movie theaters are today uh movies oh uh it costs you six fifty to go to a movie each a piece to go to uh a movie unless you catch a good matinee uh-huh well uh everything's high priced out here but uh uh yeah uh but i'd rather you know watch it on of course the only problem with cable though is it's it's is that they show the same one over about five hundred times before you know you don't get that many new ones in but uh uh they have a lot of good uh my son likes to watch uh the sports station you know and uh right uh you know things like that so uh that's what makes it worth it uh because he's handicapped and he's at home all the time so so uh uh you know he enjoys that but uh um i i like i said TV isn't my best subject because but i i do enjoy a good comedy a good movie is a comedy if i can you know sit down an[d]- and watch or if they have a good uh you know show on that's a good comedy i'm not real much for the sitcoms because of their they need to have a new twist or something in some of those you know they're getting all kind of the same but um uh it's just uh yes uh okay well it was nice talking to you and uh okay you too bye-bye now	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

you can go ahead and start if you want uh i can agree with that and uh i know one thing we we need to do a lot of spending cuts instead a lot of raising taxes because that's what's really hurting everybody's goat uh and government doesn't produce anything correct that uh i guess the uh the big thing about that is the fact that they're spending someone else's money it's not like it's they're out of their own savings account and that's another quagmire that really hurts us yeah uh-huh isn't the basic needs of the government in the first place is to protect and what is the other one basic services is to protect and i don't know about providing all the other services that they do i mean even i i guess the uh the latest uh fire they came under was whenever they were providing a uh a tribute to um Lawrence Welk contributing five hundred thousand to restoration to his home i think that was called back because of all the flack they received but but that's the another one of the big examples of why we're in such dilemma right i agree uh-huh right and the power given to the IRS is just astronomical and when you sign your ten forty form you're signing a away you're rights i mean your your rights to uh uh protect yourself and that shouldn't be that way either uh the power given to those people is just well beyond it should be and uh the really what given it was given to them by Congress right yeah it's it's it's an enormou[s]- enormous bureaucracy though it's going to take probably years to really get that in to order too because everybody will want that pet project correct and all the uh unnecessary military installations will have to be probably scrapped but that's going to be difficult but really the biggest way yeah uh probably will it's the only way it's going to change is for us to have a better budget for running this country is for everybody to get involved and right now i don't see that happening not at the moment or not at this short time period so my you have some pretty good ideas there um yeah well i'm um i voted libertarian this last election i mean in most uh some of the boxes you know i'm really am interested in getting most of the incumbents out yeah well all parties too are responsible it's not just one particular one oh i see i see well now that we have aired our views in such an open way you too have fun up there hope to talk to you again maybe	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
okay i think it's somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference and they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked you know and so they figure why go out and vote you know they're going to do what they want to do they're corrupt anyway and i think one of the good ways of solving that is to like everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party and uh you know like in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something i mean that's the only thing that i can figure out because i've heard so many people say well i'm not going on voting on that one you know i i'm going to go fishing today or it won't make any difference if if i don't vote and i think it does we vote every time right right and may[be]- maybe let them have some mock i mean uh you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start really young that's a real good idea right um God right yeah well i don't know how it is up there but down here Louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all i mean i'm sure you heard about some of ours and um people are just i mean it's like they're turned off on voting and that's the reason i said maybe if you had something like a block party okay we're going to have a block party everybody's going to get together we're going to discuss the different issues and stuff and then we're going to go and vote you know we're going to go vote like maybe they could give something like uh the top neighborhood if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that you know i mean it doesn't have to be it could be like a a sign that they would put down at the end of your block you know or anything like that but it it's really bad here i mean to me it is it seems like people just don't care anymore they say huh well it don't make any difference you know one crook is as good as the other one and they don't bother to listen to what any of them have to say and um i know my husband now we go vote every time i don't care how small the ballot is i mean if there's one thing if there's one issue because the way i feel is if i don't vote then i don't have any reason to gripe right and i hear so many people saying well i wish this would change i wish that and you know but they didn't go vote and uh maybe if they like you said if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote and all then uh and the importance of it because okay if you don't vote for your friend over here well your friend's not going to have a chance he needs your vote just like he needs everybody elses you know maybe if they were brought up that a way like you said it would because i know here uh until you get into high school now then they had the voting machines and you voted for like cheerleaders and different things like that but they should start that a lot earlier right yeah right right definitely you know a good i- idea for the young kids like that too is to have like a a mock one and okay this this candidate tells you some things that are going to happen and this candidate tells you some things okay then this percentage of the voters i mean the kids in that class they are not going to let them vote this time but they have to do whatever these people whichever one the other people elect do if they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them okay now you're not going to get to vote but you're going to have to do what that person says they would understand probably by the time they were in high school they'd be ready to vote yeah right uh-huh yeah i think that sounds great well you know they'd have to start when they're real young i mean you know it would have to be a child that is just coming in the school because i- well i'll tell you another thing too now whenever the first time i voted i never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the voting machines now this sounds dumb but i did not know how to use those voting machines and nobody ever showed us or anything so i didn't vote because anybody that went in there and they asked a question all the other kids laughed at them they thought that was funny oh she don't even know how so there wasn't any way i was going to go in there and vote and it took me i mean it took such courage you believe to go vote the first time because i was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because i didn't know how to work the machines now that's bad and i mean i was out of school i was a married person and um i didn't know how to work the machine you know and it really scared me really bad because i thought all these people are going to laugh at me because i don't know how to work this machine where if they'd if they'd had a class or something or just a short time you know th[at]- that okay this is the way right it's this is the way it's going to be and my son was exactly the same way that i was and i didn't realize it until uh his senior year i s[aid]- asked him something about well did you who did you vote for for uh cheerleader and he said oh i didn't go vote he said uh there's no way i'm getting in that machine well then i realized it so when we went and voted the next time i asked the uh lady i said i want my son to come in with me and she said well uh why you know he'll have to come back out i said because i want him to know how to use one of these and i said i won't turn any of the buttons down but i want to show him how to use it so that he'll be able to vote and uh so he went in and now he's a registered voter but he would not vote before that and i mean i think that's bad you know here i was and and even of course there's a lot of years between the two of us but even with that many years between the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

so you have three cats what type okay i'm trying to i don't know the first two the Himal[ayans]- yeah of course those the ones that always look like they're sort of scary okay uh-huh is yours skinny or is it a tubby one um-hum oh so she's young uh-huh and how the kittens come out are you keeping them sold them all yeah oh i guess i've never been around a cat when it was in heat um-hum well a friend of mine i- i don't remember what types they have but they're really really fuzzy yeah because_1 i thought she had a Himalayan but i'm not sure okay hum she sounds really pretty how old is she well she's just a tiny little thing they're adorable at that age too wow does she like to sit on top of whatever you're reading and things like that not on the keyboard my friend's cat gets on the keyboard um-hum that come from her my uh one set of friends have four cats and let's see these four cats two of them_1 are sort of strays i guess and then the other two one of which i thought was a Himalayan and the other one i'm not sure but they're both so cute and they are like big fuzz balls and they're almost more like dogs one's name is Malcolm and he sort of follows you from room to room wherever you go and things like that so it's really really cute and i didn't until i watched my friend's cats i watched a different friends two cats one of them is really old the other one um also had been like a stray but he's huge and he's we think part Angora he's he's black could that be i don't long haired yeah and yeah he was a real wild one and uh but he was fun one time i was cooking chicken and i make taken all the chicken breasts off the bones and i had this whole stack of nice chicken breasts up there and he jumped from the floor probably about four and a half feet high and grabbed one of them off and devoured it before i could get near him really wow have you ever taken videos of her or something that must be fun huh um-hum maybe she likes the smell of it that's amazing that's really cute now she can maybe she'll type something that you need for you and then you'll be in good shape like a paper oh when i had the uh cats at my place as soon as i took out the newspaper to read it they would plop right down on top of it and just not move and just stay there forever um-hum she be she gets back at kitty cat for all the hassle oh have you always had cats did you have them_1 when you were a kid my brother was asthmatic and so we never had pets in the house we had a dog for a little bit of the time and then but that time i never really liked cats you know i always thought cats were loose and sort of the typical thing you say about cats you know they don't they don't they're not people animals and things like that and i favored dogs a lot but dogs are just too impractical to have at all oh yeah it's impossible people have them_1 and they're out walking them_1 on the street but i don't think it's fair to the animals yeah do you let your cats outside um-hum are you afraid they'd get stolen or run away or well that's for sure but um-hum how old is she again you breed them that young i mean like in a year or i see but do you breed them the first time they go into heat well really wow that's amazing because_1 i would have thought that it would be better to wait a little bit and then do um-hum are you going to try and breed her several times or you'll see how the first breeding goes or uh-huh how expensive are you know thoroughbred cats to get you that's not that bad but you certainly want to protect them after that wow and how much can you sell the litter for you know the same type of price if they're good or um-hum and how much uh how many kittens do they normally have in the litter um-hum	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

it's okay you can get started there oh that's probably what i was going to say okay oh uh-huh oh yeah where where are you calling from Dallas yeah i'm from Rowlett oh really really i was going to ask you if you've been out to Southfork uh-huh huh i- i can't say i'm that much of a faithful Dallas follower maybe it's because_1 i live here and i know how {hokey} it i don't know one of my uh uh i went to school out in Plano and one of my my classmates married one of the uh uh one of the Duncans that actually owned Southfork when it started so and i think she was in some of the shows for a while as extra and stuff so yeah well what are you going to do they're they're coming to the end of their season uh i was going to say there's going to be no more Dallas reruns yeah of course they're uh they're probably going to set it up for some kind of sequel or something in the future and uh yeah it's got to come back uh-huh you didn't need to know the language how about that true and hear hear the weird voices it like yeah somebody one time was talking about John Wayne movies with these weird Japanese voices and it's hard to imagine well what do you think about what's going on on LA Law this year it's have you seen it the past couple of weeks yeah and she's pregnant did you know that and that they kicked Michael Kuzak out did you know that no he uh the the i'm trying to remember Leland decided to extend Brackman's uh reign as a senior partner and the rest of the partners all got up in arms about it and Michael met with them and said and said you know we got to do something about this we need to make a proposal let somebody else be the leader and he kind of elected himself and everybody else went along with it and they they uh gave it to Leland and he hit the roof and um he and Brackman talked about it and and Brackman decided to try and do away with him so he fired him because he he violated one of their policies of going behind a senior partner's back or something so they fired him they chased him off with the security guards they're fighting out that battle now he's firm formed his own firm he uh what else did he do he did a lot of n[asty]- nasty stuff behind their back yeah he stole Grace and Victor they've gone with him um and um <b_aside> who are the other two he stole two associates <e_aside> Abby and Jonathan he he took Abby and Jonathan with him yeah and he he went to uh he went to the bank and he took um i can't remember the guy the guy he defended for murder Earl you know they had a lien against his house so he'd pay his legal bills do you remember that yeah uh-huh th[ey]- th[ey]- they put a lien against his house so he'd pay his legal bills because_1 it was like three or four hundred thousand dollars or something well Michael reduced his legal fees to twenty thousand dollars so that they cut that out so they they couldn't have a lien on his house anymore so he did away with that and then he went to the bank because_1 the bank gave him apparently some extra credit because they had that lien well since they didn't have the lien anymore they couldn't have the credit from the bank so that that got the firm in hot water and then then Michael went to court an[d]- and uh petitioned that they needed to go into solvency because they were so financially in bad shape and uh they all showed up in court um Leland was going to try a motion make a motion before that so they ended up both being in court in front of the judge pleading their case and um i think i think Michael was doing it on the one hand and the guy that do you remember the guy that that uh Grace had an affair with the other lawyer that she had an affair with for a while kind of an older guy sh[e]- no he wasn't at the firm he was like Rosalyn Chase's lawyer before it was earlier in the season she had an affair with this other lawyer an[d]- and anyway Le[land]- Leland apparently has hired him on now and and he's defending this case and what happened at the end is the judge um um uh Michael wa[nted]- wanted the firm put in receivership and the judge wouldn't do it but he said he he's going to give a like a ten day uh evaluation and he was going to put it in the hands of a businessman to to run it and see if the firm was salvageable or not and and both parties had to come up with with lists of people that were suitable to to run it and he rejected both of the lists and came up with his own person you'll you'll never guess who this person is think of the wor[st]- well now it might be hard but think of the the worst person that's been on the show uh-huh in in the past years besides Rosalyn she's dead and gone goofy you'll never get it it's uh <b_aside> was it Roxanne <e_aside> Roxanne's ex-husband David Meyer yeah i that's who he put in charge of the firm you yeah but he's going to be he's going to be running the firm for the next i don't know ten days or to evaluate yeah that's pretty pretty strange well they they've already said that um who is it i guess it's Susan Dey and and uh whoever plays Kuzak isn't coming back next year so some of this some of this has to do with why they're not coming back i guess yeah they're going to stay there in fact um Susan Dey and and uh th[e]- the wife had had a confrontation about it why why they didn't invite them and and the the firm that Kuzak founded is just a litigation firm and they said well we wanted we wanted you but we didn't really want Stuart because he's not a {litigationist} and we didn't figure you you would come without him and and we're going to be fighting against each other so so it's just kind of weird yeah i know i know uh-huh yeah yeah that was kind of bizarre yeah it's interesting to talk about their ma[rriage]- their marriage in real life because she had breast cancer and that yeah and that was real tough for him and there were some times on the show where there were some real emotional things going on with th[e]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

right right exactly well i- i do too and uh uh i work for Texas Instruments an[d]- and they have a mandatory drug testing before you hire in and uh i enjoy that environment i- i want to be in in a you know drug free environment and i think that's a great way of uh of promoting it is to have the drug testing right would you see TI just started that policy uh the[y]- they have a random uh drug testing policy and uh uh it's random in the fact that you don't know when you're going to be called but everybody will be called and uh you mean like uh how how often would you be called up uh you may be called up twenty times and one person will only be called up once but uh uh over the whole process i this'll be an ongoing uh process uh from now on but in uh a year's time you might be called up i don't know twice or three times and nobody called up any uh but uh the way they have it set up or the way i understand is that they want everyone they've got it set up where all current employees uh will be called on a random basis but uh you know it's very likely that some may be called more uh more than others no just because of the random process of it and uh i don't know they di[d]- they talked about the the statistics of it and how they've uh tried to figure out uh you know to eliminate those problems but anytime it's uh it's a purely random sample uh you will have people called more more than others but i'm i'm all for it because uh you know uh i want a a drug free environment i don't want a uh even though i do work in th[e]- the office i'm uh a financial analyst i'm probably in no danger as far as any chemicals or anything uh or machinery but i still want people in th[e]- in the office uh to have a professional demeanor about them_1 and uh and not be under the influe[nce]- influence when they come in to work and you know i guess if they have the urge an[d]- and have that habit they can do that on their own time but uh i feel like when when we're at work uh you know it's a team atmosphere and i- i think that would distract from the team well that's that's true an[d]- and to me they're still under under the influence if it's in their body and uh i don't know i- that's i have a strong feeling that i'm against drugs and so if uh if anyone is using drugs uh uh and it's in their system when they're tested then uh you know and TI has uh a pretty uh liberal they if you're tested positive then they automatically uh test you again and uh if that one comes back positive then they send you to a uh a drug rehab which TI pays for and uh uh huh what's that right and uh uh so they send you to that and then they monitor you i- i believe on a weekly basis you have to go in and take a test for and this goes on for several months and uh if they if you can prove to them_1 that you've i don't know cleaned your act up or whatever then then uh they won't terminate you but any any time during that time if they do uh if you do test positive then uh it's automatic termination so uh are you serious right oh man that's right we[ll]- and you know the same could be true at TI if somebody's putting a missile together and they uh you know mess it up and then that puts maybe a pilot or somebody at jeopardy and uh i don't know i i think any more that uh drugs are so prevalent you know in our society that that uh it may be up to the the work place to help try to control it because it doesn't seem like any where else uh you know we're getting that assistance because in schools you know i i would hate to have a ch[ild]- young child right now because i think this is going to be a tough tough period for for young kids with uh you know the drugs as rampant as they are i see right exactly or uh uh an older peer will come up to him an[d]- and uh try to try to get him hooked on it so that he'll start selling it or something you know and uh i know uh you know just growing up i really looked up to the older guys you know especially if they played football or basketball or whatever an[d]- and uh i know that uh you know it'd be real easy to be influenced by by someone like that right golly now is this uh cocaine type oh it is huh right right golly that is terrible but i mean that makes sense because_1 uh that's where all the uh the kids are you know you have the easy access to them_1 and uh you know uh that'd make you know that would be a logical i tell you what these drug dealers are about the best business people there are because uh they know who the market is and they know exactly how to get to the market if uh if other businesses could do half as good as they do then uh there'd be some very profitable businesses but unfortunately they prey on prey on the young kids but i don't know uh the drug testing i do uh i know where my father works he he works for a government contractor also and uh uh i believe any time you have a D O uh Department of Defense contract you have to have the drug testing and uh you know like uh uh athletes are starting to uh to test them for drugs so i- i believe that it should be you know uh widespread and uh that everyone should be tested what do you think right like what about your right right w[ell]- what about uh teaching uh your profession do you think they should in in that profession right uh i guess the only the only concern i'd have right exactly i guess so somewhere else right you know i guess the only fear i would have would be that uh you know if i had a child uh that one in a million first grade teachers that would be on drugs my child would be in their class you know and and that's right an[d]- an[d]- and teachers are very influential too	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay well actually what i do i haven't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months so i haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater but i rent probably four or five movies a week we've got a good video place out here and uh uh oh gosh uh i'm just think of all the movies i've recently seen uh oh Air America have you seen Wild Orchid well it depends do you like uh steamy movies oh okay what type of movies do you like okay yeah do you like suspense movies or do you like uh just action or oh Jagged Edge Jagged Edge was a suspenseful one or uh Fatal Attraction oh well i hope i don't run across them what was your favorite all time movie i i have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most uh that i was really the most in shock with was probably uh Star Wars when that first came out i really did not expect the special effects or anything like that i mean i guess uh out of all the movies i've i've never been as excited to go back i was ready to go back and see it again you know now i i also liked uh oh Gone with the Wind or some of the classic like The Lawrence of Arabia oh you haven't oh yeah no that's uh that's a that's a real interesting movie and it's got a good historical perspective to it oh yeah actually i just saw a movie uh called The Lost Capone and it's about Al Capone's brothers primarily one of his brothers and i won't give the the whole plot away but it's it's really a good movie uh Al Capone had three brothers and one of them was lost for many many years and uh he actually he turns out to be a law man yeah it's really interesting it no that's okay i didn't give away the whole thing i just gave away just enough to get you interested yeah it is and a lot of times what i wind up doing is picking say an actor or an actress and seeing like all i've seen all of James Dean's movies uh all of Mae West's movies and just kind of kind of go out and uh rent all the movies and uh uh you know just kind of go i guess you could do that you know get all of David Carradine's movies or uh um Segal to what's his first name i can't remember his first name is it David Segal i don't know he was on uh on uh uh Arsenio just recently it was really kind of interesting because Arsenio was asking him about uh what he thought of uh one of the other action guys God i can't even remember the name he said well he wouldn't really talk about it didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such a uh a good action guy it wasn't Stallone it was uh i can't remember shoot i can't remember the guys name but i like all the the Rambo movies yeah yo Adrian no we we actually rent uh probably a goo[d]- good combination of movies with the exception of horror films don't watch really very many horror films at all you know i don't know there's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you or something you know it's just you know coming out of the TV that just doesn't make my day you know yeah yeah i just saw uh uh a really interesting movie called uh Flatliners yeah yeah it was just crazy enough for th[e]- you know students might try to do it you know i mean and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it yeah yeah oh yeah that was a great movie yeah uh have you seen Shrimp on the Barbie yeah it's got no no uh Hogan yeah no no no it's got uh uh Cheech Marin yeah yeah it is it's kind of uh kind of a poor man's Pretty Woman in reverse but it was kind of cute actually did you see Dirty Rotten Scoundrels i though that was a really cute movie i enjoyed that yeah no i haven't i hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video uh well my wife uh has got a uh a picture from Kevin Costner and he signed it it's from Dances with Wolves yeah and he signed it he he happens to be uh a friend of one of her her business associates and all right not not a friend a cousin a cousin so uh uh but anyhow we got uh we got a nice uh picture and it came in an envelope that says Dances with Wolves so we've got to uh try to get out there and see that one huh now did you see uh Driving Miss Daisy okay	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay um now we're supposed to talk about social activities right uh-huh i think um well i guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation i think your generation is um what do i say uh uh they're they're they're polite they have more respect for other people just in in general i think and just just towards people and property and um i i guess they would would be more conservative some of them i guess uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yes i agree with uh-huh well well do you think that that maybe i mean uh i've heard different you know like um like i know my mom and like other ladies they complain because they think that um the women now are too busy with their own personal life and career that they really don't have time for their kids uh-huh yeah oh my gosh just a baby oh my gosh uh-huh yeah well as um well i think the education like our education has um increased dramatically but then i think also that we're forgetting like basic things like we should know like i i think well um in the morals and values of like my generation for the most for most people are totally different from the morals and valleys um values of like per se your generation but i think as we get older it gets to your you know what i mean i think the kids now are are i would say louder now until after they reach like twenty five and then i think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize things uh-huh yeah because i think we're given more now whereas you had to work for everything and kids nowadays are just given so much that they really don't have to work and you know and they they don't have any intent to go working until they have to uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i don't know because i know i don't watch while i'm up here at school i don't watch hardly any TV like Thursday night i like to sit down and watch a few shows but other than that no i don't watch that i used to but i don't any more but all i mean there are even though there's a few up here we call them couch potatoes they love to sit in front of the TV i i said but for the for the most part i will i will well i live in an all girls dorm but for the most part we're all between the ages of eighteen and like twenty one and there isn't really a lot of TV watching they're either hitting the books or something i don't know what but i know oh well i guess they have their crowds like during the soap operas you know like in between classes or something but i can't say that there's really that many people that like sit in front of the TV all day uh-huh but then um like i know this girl she's doing her student teaching or she's just working like within the school and um yesterday she was at the kindergarten and there's this little boy he like didn't want to do anything and he said i'm not doing this i don't like it and he sat at his desk with two pencils in his hand and pretend like he's playing Nintendo you know so uh i don't know how i mean i never really watched that a lot of TV when i was younger but my parents really didn't allow us to watch that much TV so i don't know uh-huh yeah well we watch a lot of i guess we watched a lot of TV in the winter time but in the summer like right now my mom well like she doesn't let us watch TV until like eight o'clock at night you know are like well like my younger brothers and sisters at home like when it starts getting nice outside in the summer and everything she'll she makes us go outside even now when i go home for the summer she makes us go outside and we're allowed to come in and watch TV until it's dark because she doesn't like the TV herself and if it was up to her we wouldn't have one so you know she feels that kids are too dependent on it also um what about in our work ethics i i uh-huh uh-huh um yeah well i really can't think of anything else uh-huh it was nice talking to you too	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

so uh have you got any repairs done by auto shops on your car or do you do maintenance work or what um-hum still still under warrantee right yeah do you do any uh body work on the Honda yeah yeah scrape it and paint it put primer on it then paint it don't put paint over else it'll just continue rusting under it yeah so you you're ready to talk about it do you so you change like you change your own oil and oil filters uh i mean i yeah i i know where you're coming from because i do the i do the minor things to my car uh but i don't right exactly i was about_1 to say yeah i just do what i can i don't really you know i don't you know it's like the simple things changing the oil checking the fluids you know rotating tires things like that that you don't need heavy equipment for yeah yeah yeah um-hum right right yeah because it things go wrong and you don't know what the hell's going on and you don't you don't know where to start and that's where it costs money yeah right those are electronical diagnostics yeah i have a a fuel injected engine so i don't do anything to the engine you know it's like i don't i don't want to mess with it because since i don't know exactly all the ratios you know and everything that all the proportions the fuel and air and compression and all that stuff that needs to be precise and it's controlled by computer i figure i won't mess with that but i mean i play with everything else that you know that's not too serious you know you can bend it one way and you bend it right back or you know turn it just as long as as like you were saying it's not too hard to take apart and put back together i'll try it have you had any body work done on your car that stuff is expensive yeah but yeah i went i went uh i got in a wreck recently and uh well i didn't do much damage to my car but i did some pretty heavy duty damage to the other car i have a plastic bumper and i happened to hit the rim of the tire it made like a little semicircular incision on my plastic bumper right and and and kind of put little fissures on the on the paint of the bumper because it's plastic so when it bent you know when the plastic bent it kind of cracked to to change that bumper covering of the plastic cover was going to run me five hundred bucks on my car that just to change the cover you know because do just had to get the that whole cover my my car's a Beretta they had a big big bumper they got on there big white bumper that covers like the whole bottom front of the car that that whole thing you know to be replaced and repainted would cost five hundred dollars and i got this guy to uh to this this uh company i don't know if you ever heard of Maaco Auto Body Shop i got the i talked to the owner and he said that the best thing to do if i wanted to save money was uh to just go ahead and since there was no major damage he could just kind of like fill in the little ridges where the where the uh rim hit with some like bond or something and then paint over it and it would look just like new for only two hundred bucks so i did that instead but and it you can't tell you can't tell the difference you know it just looks like a brand new bumper and it hey i saved three hundred bucks right very important yeah i think that's ridiculous isn't it forty five dollars i mean people people get out of college and work for less than that yeah yeah like that commercial that you plan for uh the car new car second garage but you didn't plan on breaking down ever see that commercial it's it's pretty good it's i think it's um a bank commercial or something like that and uh it just kind of flashes out these uh partial sentences like you planned on and it says a new garage second car and then all a sudden the music in the background changes and it says but you didn't plan on it breaking down yeah yeah that's true that's that's uh that's one thing about dealerships is you don't i don't think you get the real quality work at dealerships because they have to work with so many cars it just kind of right yeah they want as much money as they can yeah yeah but i think yeah i think uh i think public transportation will move up though in the future i mean i think we pretty much phased out the bus but i think maybe uh you know um like subways you know public transportation such as subways and monorails will probably come in well yeah i mean not nothing like in the next ten years but more like in the next fifty to a hundred	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

uh i don't know i'm not a real great ba[ll]- uh football follower i guess there are two basic teams that i seem to follow every year one is the Dallas Cowboys and the other is the Oklahoma Sooners uh being a a native {Okie} i uh i like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing uh no you know it's funny uh i got out and got my bachelor's degree in uh seventy three and uh never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since but i always enjoyed watching them i just growing up in uh in Oklahoma there it was always the home team kind of like Dallas is around here and there's always been an interest there yeah i guess you keep those things you grew up with i worked in uh Missouri for a while and uh i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on TV when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals and i was rooting for the Cowboys but they were kind of closer to home and and i stuck up with them i really don't know what's going to take place with with the Cowboys this year uh everybody keeps talking about the reconstruction they're going through and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year in a way that happened this past season and i think there's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there's there's a chance that maybe uh uh these guys are right maybe they will come through and and do something this year i look for it to be a pretty good year they did uh they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we weren't uh weren't familiar with some of them turned out to be pretty good players uh some of them didn't and you know maybe the stuff that uh Jerry Jones is talking about the uh the reconstruction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off at least we hope it will yeah but they have always been a really strong team once the pressure gets turned on they they seem to lose it now see that's the typical trait of the Dallas Cowboys and and the Oklahoma Sooners it's funny over the years it's it's been a rough tow a rough road to hoe ever since he left i don't know why it's so hard to find uh a good quarterback these days well yeah you know he was um one of the few who've come through in history that can really perform uh we hope every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through in a way Aikman has done some of that but uh the guy winds up getting hurt every other game and you can't do that and stay yeah they did they put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside uh it's funny watching them them play he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks uh when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best and i haven't quite figured that out if if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or uh if if something happens that that adrenaline really starts flowing they say hey we got to do something now and and start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few few minutes so i don't know i'm looking for for a good year i guess we're always looking for a good year uh no i don't think the Cowboys have got a chance i think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year and they'll get close to it they'll probably get everybody's hopes up and and blow it toward the end uh that's a good question uh i'm figuring either one either the Eagles or possibly San Francisco i'm not real sure i don't they did so i don't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the the team sometimes it brings in new motivation and and y[ou]- all you can do is get out of the way because here they come well that's true they are tough and they're big they're mean and they are going to come right through you if you don't do something oh yeah yeah no no and it's funny you know You like to pull for the underdog and for a long time i was pulling for Denver uh Marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes because of some of the stupid stuff he does but he's a good quarterback he's got a good arm sometimes it's too good because he throws too hard i mean Elway sorry and oh yeah that's uh had been uh snowing up there wow well that will make the snow skiers happy oh you bet oh yeah up around the Keystone and Copper Mountain up there those those guys will love that well good to talk to you you guys have a good time keep those printers coming all right

well thanks for being home uh on the weekend i uh i'm actually working at night and uh there very few people that are on the list for calls uh on the weekends nights are are you part of the school system out there uh the reason i said that because i've had about uh three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of North Carolina i guess they pass the names amongst your computer students or whatever oh is that ri[ght]- great great oh is that right that's wonderful oh yeah i talked to one we're not on the subject of course i talked to one i think he had a whole bunch of calls he had a roommate that had calls and everything he had way more twice as many calls as as i've made uh and i i'm of course we at TI just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will uh uh sell like gang books bu[sters]- busters really okay you first on the subject wha[t]- what do you think about Latin America Latin America yeah oh really TI had a place i'm not to sure i don't think they do anymore down i think it was Campinas i'm not sure and uh i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever and they had quite a few locations not quite a few several in Latin America i think the one in Mexico is closed and i think the one in in Brazil is closed but i i don't know why that is a problem down there and i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too and uh and some people say go to New York but i don't i don't have an answer to the crime rate it's sad that is a sad situation i i'd like to go down to Mexico you know and i keep hearing that you know the government and and the crime rates pretty high too that that is sad uh not that we can uh sell any great program we have with crime but uh i think uh i'm kind of like you i don't have any strong opinions on it i guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with our our neighbors down there is that we don't have any we have more i guess ties we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything and we don't really aren't that close to everyone in South America i don't really know why though right right yeah i know that i saw in a book i was reading a Spanish book uh not that i read Spanish you know i just you know reading some Spanish words and there was a comment in there about the Mexicans don't really want us to say we're Americans they would like to say that we're North Americans because they're Americans too you know and i guess that's true we don't think of any one else but oursel[ves]- i guess we're kind of uh the smart asses in the world i suppose uh or of America anyway we think of ourselves as the only Americans when they're Americans too as Mexicans yes that that no no i know yeah no i mean they were saying that of us that we're the North Americans and they're Americans they they we always say we're Americans and they they want us to say we're the North Americans we're not Americans we're North Americans and they're South Americans yeah whatever i i don't want to make i read it somewhere though it's not my point i guess no no they they were lucky enough to have some oil what ten years ago an and they they blew all that and borrowed enou[gh]- more money than they can pay back now and uh uh so they're not exactly business men i do think we should deal more with them i don't i do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in Texas uh for the language you know is very foolish i'm relative relatively familiar with Texas school system and we should teach Spanish at least in uh grammar school you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish i think that helps when you certainly can speak their language uh and there are problems with you know the wet back problem you know for everyone knows what we're talking about when say wet back problem and then we should somehow uh and i think the governments are working on that to try to have some uh businesses uh at the borders of both sides so that you can you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here and to to get the jobs you know there there may be some organized way to do this i i do feel for them uh they are very envious of us or they wouldn't be coming up here you know risking a lot not that they're risking their lives of course but risking a lot uh getting thrown back i guess is all that uh happens you probably don't see that where we see it you know once a month i'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that okay well you see it saw it out there then too uh-huh yeah i think a a common factor to a lot of problems both whether it be crime if if you want to jump on that is mostly uh poverty uh and i think a lot of their problems is poverty if we could uh uh the problems we have you know in this country is is a lot of it's poverty whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty i that's another story but uh uh it is sad there there's so much down in all of South America uh so much potential you know we're TI of course is is really pushing world markets in their products and they're they're mostly in in Europe now and in in in the Orient Japan and Singapore now just announced building a plant in Singapore uh they're in Taiwan and Japan and they're they haven't had what that much luck in South America and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything there's got to be trade i guess that's some of the answer i guess is business uh uh and i try to be an optimist and say well that that's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to is to get some business going between each other and we need we need to do more of that uh somehow and encourage more business between us they've got to have a lot of resources i would think an enormous amount of of well potential that way a lot of it of course is hot and jungle and all that but uh there's got to be a lot of potential down there what are what are you taking in school i didn't ask you that what are you taking in school oh you you're an instructor yeah you're an instructor yeah you said that's great are you teaching Computer Science wha[t]- you said what were you saying you were teaching there great great right i of course i work at TI and i'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time why that isn't enough i mean i'm i'm i'm getting a kick out of the whole program but uh there's going to be i guess thousands i don't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings and i wonder how they're going to analyze them whether it would be listening to them or analyzing i g[uess]- they've got to be analyzing with a a voice recorder some how uh-huh right oh yes i know they change with age i know mine changes uh has changed uh although you you never found your your voice echoes in your own head which is makes it different than what it really sounds to other people uh i'm sure singers and professional people know that and you always hear your own voice in recordings and say my God that's that's not obviously that's not me you know but uh i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way uh go ahead you you comment on it yeah i'm glad that you're in the business that i know TI's gotten it with their Speak and Spell and everything i've told my wife that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer you wouldn't have to have a keyboard you'll be able to just give it commands and i'm sure they have some of that now and not not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

all right i i think our experience of camping is i i am the the passive member i get things ready and then i enjoy uh because my my husband is a good camper and so they he manages the troops and they do the work and i have fun that's when we camped the most when i thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because uh i it seems like i would go through a period of time where i just uh was really overworked you know and and getting out into nature and relaxing and having the family do a good share of the work you know and the part that i did was more fun than uh than labor because they did the the running and toting chores and i just helped cook and kind of organize you know it is isn't it it isn't ha[ve]- what kinds of things have you tried have you done uh uh uh the big pot cooking uh-huh oh yeah big frying p[an]- oh that's interesting you know interesting enough uh the food part was kind of uh important thing in our camping uh when my oldest son uh always at the beginning i did all the shopping and everything but the the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his uh uh cooking merit badge in and and Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef Stroganoff and uh i mean you know he did it up really good and so uh after he took that merit badge he did all the shopping and preparing getting ready for it it was it was a marvelous experience because after that then all i had to do was uh follow the instructions you know and do and we did a lot of interesting kinds of things like i would take corn bread and uh cook a pan inside of a pan over a over a camp uh stove and it works real good it's like an oven just put uh put a thing on it what did you like to do most that's neat isn't it right i agree huh well now in Florida is there is there ti[mes]- are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot uh-huh oh is that true now now we're we're in Texas now and you're in Texas right okay uh we have not camped a great deal here because uh a good share of the time in the Summer time it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping i gue[ss]- yeah yeah we have done that but but we camped mostly when the kids were little we were in we were in New Jersey and w[e]- uh in uh Allendale and uh and uh Waldwick it's just about twelve miles south of the New York border and we'd go up to the Adirondacks and camp and it was so you know pick your own uh blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast uh also go ahead oh are you where did you live oh oh yeah i know that i had a cousin who lived in White Plains that's a that's a neat area but it's a that is a particularly neat area for camping because yeah it is neat though because there are lots of lakes fairly near by you don't have to go very far and uh and there's uh a lot of trees lot of mountains and lot of uh hiking sort of things and and we had uh collapsible boat which we uh clipper little clipper sail boat and so we would sail and and uh did a lot of camping that way oh do you we've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis and it's fun too i think do you that's neat so you kind of uh uh an everyday camper a full time camper well now are you living alone now or you and your dog huh hey that sounds great well we don't we don't camp quite as much as we used to but uh i still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family and and enjoy nature and uh kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life i'd always right i'd always come home just relaxed and uh comfortable and ready to go at it again so it was a neat activity good to talk to you tell me your name again Jack all right ye[s]- yes we've been here we're we're in Plano but we've been here about uh eighteen years are you are you how about that well we're all lots of people from TI up this way all right good to talk to you all right all right bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

around my house yeah boy that's a shame uh-huh um-hum don't you miss them_1 now i mean because_1 they're they have such personalities um-hum yeah right yeah right right uh-huh yeah right yeah yeah yeah you know you think you're you think that's what you want and i really gave it a good try and i had her spoiled i mean she was spoiled rotten but she was so and i have a new house and i and to walk in my house i'd have e[specially]- uh especially on a rainy day i'd have to take a bucket of water out there and wash all four of her feet this is a dog i'm going to pick up a leg at a time and wash and set it down on something clean while i got the other three you know and and then i'd let her in the house well still even putting her feet in the bucket of water and wash them_1 real good she still would come in so fast and so heavy that she'd dig her paws deep down into my carpet you know and just take out running to and she would oh she was ruining my carpet and i thought gosh i i love my new house more than i love her i you know i just really have a big investment and i don't i just it was just more work than it was r[eally]- really i wasn't enjoying her that's what it was maybe if i'd a had a run for a dog run but i think that's cruel to put a dog in a run uh-huh yeah yeah but now see i have always felt that i could always smell cats cats to me alway[s]- i i i used to have some friends' house that i couldn't stand to go in their house i could smell their their litter box i thought oh my God i couldn't stand it and i don't know how they stood it i guess they didn't smell it oh do you uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah yeah that's right well i wouldn't either uh-huh well i know is there're supposed to be is it Chihuahuas they're supposed to be good for asthma they say Chihuahua dogs are supposed to be good for people with asthma i always heard oh yeah and don't i think they're using you know they're using animals in old folks home now and ma[ke]- and some hospitals because it's supposed to make people brings your blood pressure down you know dogs are always so happy to see you come home you know they always are just wagging i don't care how grumpy you are or what dogs are glad to see you cats are kind of independent like get in they're they let you live with them_1 you know so independent uh-huh uh-huh oh oh see i was thinking about buying a horse maybe uh-huh just to f[eed]- oh uh-huh cost i think i'll just go rent a horse if i want to ride yeah i do too yeah no i mean well i do enjoy my dog uh she's such a oh she's my best friend and when when i lived in Orlando she uh got paralyzed from her waist down and uh waist and i thought it was uh uh we almost had to put her to sleep and i just cried for two days but i think what i- i- i ironically what happened was she g[ot]- had fleas and i think it was the stuff i was ha[ving]- putting on her that that paralyzed her but the fleas i think's what brought her back is she had to scratch so bad that she started using her paraly[zed]- the the doctor was just amazed at a that she came back because he really was going to was going to do surgery for fifteen hundred dollars or put her to sleep and i was going to have to opt to have to put her to sleep even as mu[ch]- much as i loved her i wasn't going to spend fifteen hundred dollars on an experiment no but it was just uh that spot that they put on the back of a dog uh they used to use it on cattle and uh so i started using it on her and i'd take to her to the vet once a month and get that spot put on her and she wouldn't have any fleas never had any fleas hadn't never any then all of a sudden uh i took her i was living in Orlando and i p[ut]- i put her in the vet f[or]- while i came home to Dallas for a while and i took and when i picked her up she had fleas again and so my daughter came down and visited m[e]- me from Dallas and and while she was there the dog got paralyzed and so i took her back up to the doctor and anyway he he said it wasn't that but another doctor told me that there had been uh people the pet owners had been getting permanently paralyzed from petting the dogs that had that spot on them_1 so i thought well a[nd]- so i can't find a vet that'll do that for me anymore put the spot on her anymore and i don't want it anymore anyway but i do fight fleas oh gosh yeah oh i moved back in eighty eight the December of eighty eight yeah i lived here before i'd worked for TI for seventeen years and then i moved to Orlando uh with Mark and Marietta and l[et]- let me talk about fleas we have nothing compared to fleas down they have down there and they have them_1 year round at least they die out kind of in the wintertime here in the yard down there they don't they're are just and they are big suckers i mean big and they are just almost impossible to get rid of it costs a fortune if you have a pet you're going to have fleas down there and i just had my house treated and treated and treated and treated and d[id]- i did all the things you're supposed to and i couldn't get rid of	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

start um the well right now they've got a kind of a central location off of the main highway and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper um plastic um i think three bins for glass white green and whatev[er]- whatever other combination there is and i think they've got a uh some kind of container for aluminum uh-huh yeah um uh-huh um well that's good well Rowlett had sent sent out a survey not too long ago um in terms in how many people were interested in having a a pick up i guess on the days they do trash or something like that And apparently a lot of people responded to it favor[ably]- favorably because they're going to do it i don't know how how soon they're going to do it or how organized it's going to be but they're they're supposed to initiate that some sometime in the next couple of months um i've never noticed that we don't have a a whole lot because we're in a hospital setting so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria um um no there's there's only one pop machine and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now so uh mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea no not not really uh-huh um uh-huh um-hum yeah that's good yeah i i guess Rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is and i think they're trying to to make some changes i i noticed at the library or someplace this past uh month month and a half ago they were having a speaker um talk about doing lawn work and h[ow]- how important it is to to cut your lawn without a bag just kind of mulch it rather than bag it up because of a[ll]- all the the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff and it's uh i guess a lot more e[cological]- ecological to just mow the grass and let it work it's way back into the soil i saw part of that um-hum uh-huh uh-huh yeah um yeah well there are a lot of things that aren't i'm that's uh one of the things i wonder about uh one of the questions was do you think more should be done or something else i i wonder about some of the prod[ucts]- products that they don't take like some of the plastics and things that they don't take uh why why they couldn't do more recycling with those hum yeah true yeah i noticed that about things like i s[een]- i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and and lawn additives and that type of thing but the cost is is like double or sometimes triple what the regular things you fertilizers and things you buy so in in terms of that it's you know for the environment it its there is good reason to do it the cost is kind of prohibited uh-huh yeah it's a good idea uh-huh yeah true um yeah i i'd heard something stranger talk about bottles the other day on uh on the radio station i think it's K L T Y they were talking about the i think it's in Canada they're using oh recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs as a a reinforcement for roads for road repairs and apparently they they don't break down very easily and they don't expand or or contract when the weather changes and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing uh-huh huh uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah well i think the the more people are aware of it the the more they'll do i think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that uh-huh yeah true uh-huh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
okay uh my first thoughts on capital punishment i[s]- i the first thing i want to say i[s]- is no just simply because we as human beings don't have the right to take another human being's life uh we are punishing someone for taking someone's life or in some cases we are punishing s[omeone]- -[some]one a person for taking someone's life and so in effect we're committing that same crime um-hum right um-hum um-hum ex[actly]- uh-huh one thing i don't understand is the the whole concept of death row okay these people are supposedly i guess waiting to die right okay and there are thousands upon thousands of people on death row and i'm not saying that well i guess i am kind of saying what what are we doing i mean i guess that's the same thing you were saying what what are we doing with these people they're they're there we should either take some kind of action or take enough or or go a different route but they're just oh exactly um-hum um-hum exactly um-hum right but and i guess i see both sides in that at the at the same time that i'm saying that you know we're committing the same crime i also agree that i mean if there's somebody out there that's crazy and cruel enough to kill somebody or in some cases kill several people at one time uh there was a case in Dallas well i'm sure they haven't gone to court yet but uh apparently two teenage boys held up a Taco Bell they put four people in a freezer and shot them_1 all now to me that is inhumane and for two people to be out in the world like that i don't i don't want them in my world you understand what i'm saying i i'm i mean i'm not for killing anyone but i don't want these people around at the same time exactly um-hum right and um-hum right right um-hum and at and at the same time like you said it drains society we i think we should be we the same money that we're using to build more prisons and make more prison space and pu[t]- keep these people in prison that same money or half of that money could be used towards uh rehabilitation programs of some sort something to get to to put these people back in society but prepare them first um-hum um-hum exactly um-hum um-hum right um-hum and y[ou]- you want people out of prison you want people to get jobs and and live happy lives but they can't just walk out of prison and do that they can't just walk out of prison and say okay i'm going to go a different route there has to be some sort of buffer in there some sort of program or and i know this costs money but it couldn't cost anymore money than we're already spending um-hum really how what can we do oh goodness i mean you know everyone's trying to make it you know in their own little world you know i'm trying to make it with my job and make you know myself okay and make my family okay and it's so hard to you know try and be one of the movers and shakers i guess you would call them_1 um-hum oh yeah right and i i'm a broadcast journalist and so i feel like one day i probably will write a book or or something you know and some of these views will be able to come out i work at channel six here i'm a i'm a news reporter and so i i guess i'm i'm pretty emotional about crime like that now i've only been in it for a year but i get to see pretty much uh close up you know a lot of things that happen that people don't see uh i got to s[ee]- get to see a lot of crimes and i get to see you know people's uh pain and things and so when we talk about yeah exa[ctly]- um-hum um-hum a service yeah but still you know we can't shut we can't i don't i i guess i would like to probably editorialize more we have to just report what's happening we can't say well this is what i think about you know the situation sometimes you really want to say that you really want to say what you think or what you think should be done or how you think this court case should have gone or you know that's a um-hum especially when you are dealing with a a subject like uh capital punishment or something or abortion or something where there's an an no or yes side and you have your side and you have to report both sides but you really don't want to because you have your side yeah yeah so sometimes that's hard but um-hum um-hum okay all right well it was nice talking to you okay okay bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well have you ever been a victim of any p[articular]- any type of crime uh-huh sounds like you've been very fortunate i haven't had too many terrible things happen to me but my tee tops did get stolen one time off my car out of right uh no it's a TransAm it's very expensive and insurance companies don't like it either yeah well i i did put an alarm on the car after that and uh i kept that for a while until the alarm malfunctioned and started going off in the middle of the night for no reason and it upset the neighbors in the apartment complex so i disabled it uh-huh right yeah uh-huh yeah you stop and think about what you can do to uh to prevent or reduce crime and in fact tonight uh alone i i got a phone call from one of the security uh uh systems home security systems that uh install uh uh systems in your home to uh monitor and uh i guess detect uh it's tha[t]- that type of break ins they uh have a certain fee that they charge each month and an installation fee and they're real ho[t]- hot about uh trying to get uh trying to sell these systems to everybody do you know what the do you know the name brand is for that okay that's the their own personal alarm brand okay there are several systems like that there's one that uh uh employees sale sold once upon a time called Schlage that's also modular and wireless and you can add as many sensors as you need to well there's s[ome]- some right but there's also a lot of people who are end up being victimized by their own weapons a burglar comes in and uh finds a gun and ends up using it against the owners of the house so oh certainly yeah depending on the crime i think i discussed that at at another right well it's such a waste of taxpayers' money too to put them in prison for life uh especially if there's no chance of parole so uh sometimes that's the best solution i guess uh-huh yeah uh-huh well it makes some sense but uh the the users end up being addicts and they uh they commit crimes for for a living to make the the cash to buy their drugs with so uh and they have no respect or for for any other people anyway oh that was in Malaysia and they they were two two guys from Australia and right uh-huh well we're not the only country that has a a drug problem a lot of a lot of countries do especially smaller third world nations and their governments uh strictly enforce uh policies against uh drug use and uh uh dealing and things like that so yeah the death penalty uh exists and it is put in force uh-huh right well you make a habit out of it and it's a tolerable situation uh i also grew up in in a rural area and my a lot of my relatives are on dairy farms they would leave the house unattended unlocked just figuring that if anybody really wanted to break in they would anyway and there wasn't much of value to take any way uh up in uh Wisconsin but i've been fortunate i guess in that the only things that have happened to me are the tee tops and hubcaps off cars well sure uh-huh and and Plano is pretty good about it too they've got excellent uh police force here uh i haven't seen any any evidence of uh any uh mischievous deeds going on in my neighborhood the suburbs it's not near as bad in the suburbs as it is in the city Dallas is pretty bad uh-huh yeah right that's right yeah i know people that have been victimized too a lot more seriously it's uh it's not pleasant to think about that and uh you have to live with that forever so yeah i enjoyed talking to you about the subject uh yes okay have a good evening sure bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
ready social changes well whatever whatever i guess you want to whether things changed over the last uh twenty years all right good enough here we go well uh let's see i guess some of the some of the things uh civil rights have come a long way i guess in the last twenty years yeah yeah that's true yeah and i guess i guess uh women's rights have come with that too i guess so that's uh probably not um-hum um-hum yeah yeah that's true yeah that's right what's i guess uh part of that was that uh twenty twenty five years ago Japan wasn't uh hello okay that twenty twenty five years ago that Japan wasn't uh wasn't what it is now so that that's probably caused some changes um-hum oh yeah like uh like the old Subarus and uh the old old Datsuns um-hum uh no we don't as a matter of fact yeah yeah and uh but uh what else what else has changed oh i guess uh Watergate was in there so i guess pol[itics]- politics in general has kind of kind of gone downhill in the last because_1 i ca[n]- i can remember maybe before Nixon that uh the presidents were really up on a pedestal yeah or else we or else we know about it now one or the other yeah um-hum yeah no no i there's no easy answer that's for sure or else they would've uh done something by now i guess but uh and probably the only other thing i can think of in the last uh oh twenty years or so i guess is that uh family structures have changed a lot um-hum that's true yeah yeah it doesn't seem the norm to have uh have parents and and uh the two what two point five kids and all that uh yeah true yeah but it it it's sad that we're we're losing the grandparents and the uncles that that fam[ily]- you know beyond that families don't seem to get close anymore and that's probably got something to do with what you're saying about the migratory yeah yeah yeah i- i think you're right i- i think that's uh very rare anymore that uh definitely people aren't at family reunions on a regular basis and uh and a lot of them_1 i guess don't do it at all so because_1 i know it's been a long long time since our family ever did anything like that so that's true um-hum it's it's it's easier to to fight i guess when you can find them i remember that was the the problem back then you just couldn't find them yeah i mean uh not not uh-huh um-hum um-hum um-hum overpower them_1 well it's probably because_1 it lasted so long you know i guess it's yeah um-hum um-hum yeah um-hum um-hum yeah more of a more information processing yeah um-hum yeah no that's true that's true over the last uh twenty years that's uh that's a definite change and it's only going to only going to get worse i guess in the near future it's going to be more rapid i guess um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah um-hum um-hum um-hum or electrical engineering probably yeah um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
how bad is it do you have smog like they do in California uh-huh hm depends_1 on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion i take yeah um-hum um-hum what do you think is your primary cause of it you do you really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas um-hum hm my goodness um-hum i think a lot of it's industrial i also think uh that uh there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles but it's mostly from older automobiles i don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting uh frankly i think that uh i think that um uh if uh i- i- i heard a story a while back something effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent or take all the cars off of the road that have been uh manufactured say before nineteen seventy five that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining yeah fro[m]- from cars that is not f[rom]- not total but just from cars okay so that i think would be a tremendous help and i happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical and it just keeps getting uh gives me good service and i don't have an incentive to get rid of it long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money on the other hand i know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars i have but to get out of it until it dies and uh that may be part of the problem al[so]- yeah yeah yeah oh uh yeah it's it's uh pretty heavy up here i think but i think it's mostly industrial is what i really uh believe is the the main problem and and uh and uh uh people uh i don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should i i we we seem to have a high uh cancer rate up here in Maryland yeah and uh well uh for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant and uh i think of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody but uh th[is]- th[is]- this state was like uh second my wife's a registered nurse and i think this state was like second this year from the top in terms of uh cancer rate for just all kinds and i can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution i just don't know exactly what it necessarily is but i just can't believe this now we have a lot of pollution being caused by chlorof[luorocarbons]- uh fluorocarbons which is the like freon twelve and freon twenty two they use freon twenty two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer and i can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also and having all kinds of effects an[d]- well they're working now i know DuPont and Dow and several other chemical companies are working uh feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons and whoever does is gonna make a a mint because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of fluorocarbons then uh well they used to be but they made them_1 take it out of that right no they they they m[ade]- passed a law and made them_1 take fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers and that was a move in the right direction we are doing some things to try to correct the problem but there are more things we could do and getting rid of old cars like i said is one way to help correct the problem uh uh just trying to i think be careful uh with the way you handle garbage i notice in this state i don't know if you're doing it in Texas yet or not but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces uh you know containers in yeah yeah well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too but they uh in one of the counties here they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police they have a lady that goes around like a meter maid and she spot checks people's trash and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your they'll fine you fifty bucks i think the first time and two fifty the second time yeah you right you got to give people incentives and surprisingly enough just handling of trash uh can cut pollution uh from uh uh from just throwing it in a dump or or or or whatever else they used to do with it maybe used to burn it they've stopped that up here too but that that will cut pollution too because_1 you get a lot of out gassing from these things i think decaying and tr[ying]- and trying to for instance cans and bottles they never go away at all well on on the other had i don't guess they're polluting but plastic containers and the like uh they may be ah i'm not sure of that oh i think that's very important to do i i really think that uh trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very very important thing and uh that can help to cut pollution i guess some i- i don't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air i would hope that they would help some though that's for sure um um-hum um-hum oh good well that uh that i think may go on a lot and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said somebody happened to stay up late night or something i don't think we have a adequate policing uh esp[ecially]- particularly on industry uh we have good policing at least in this state and and uh several of the surrounding states and probably yours too of car pollutants because we have to go down uh once a year here in Maryland and get our car's exhaust systems checked for emissions content um-hum uh no we don't have a state inspection but anytime you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state i don't know uh i[t]- that's something that you'd have to just check with your authorities but in this state we have to uh pay eight dollars and a half and go to a an emission station once a year and get everyone of our cars checked that are have been made starting in nineteen seventy three no no we don't have inspections like that now i'm in Maryland in Virginia they check that every two years i think and i think that's a good idea too not no[t]- not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution n[ecessarily]- necessarily but i think it's a good idea the emissions check though is required in Maryland and it's also required in Virginia uh a sister state to to this and that's that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants um-hum well if they don't i would imagine in time they'll get along with i[t]- they'll get around to it and if they don't then that's something i would c[ertainly]- certainly uh uh suggest you'd be willing to uh um be for in terms of uh yeah yeah oh yeah i i agree now that's another area we hadn't even discussed and that is water pollution and various of the other types of uh of uh like food pollution i mean you you hardly ever hear hear anybody say anything about food pollution but i think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this country so uh hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of uh pollutants in our food but water pollution uh i've worried uh especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like i know a lot more people are going to bottled water yeah tap yeah um-hum y[eah]- yeah i'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course have it checked because_1 it seems uh when i was a kid growing up down south uh i used to go out in the country where my grandparents were and we had a well with one of those draws that i forget what you call those things and and that was some of the best tasting water i mean i can still to this day taste that water yeah uh-huh huh oh i bet it was yeah th[e]- i[t]- once it's been filtered and if it's a deep enough well filtered through all the earth and everything i think that uh it depends of course where you are a good well though i think is very healthy	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay yeah uh-huh um i believe in it too uh i'm Catholic and we're not supposed to but uh i feel that it like you you know on the premeditated murders i feel if you're you know i mean if it's beyond a doubt that you did it you know i would say go ahead and execute that person as well but it's the cases you know like sometimes you you know you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely you know they really didn't do it well you know you you got you got that point well h[ow]- you know what what if a mistake is made and you put someone you know to death that really didn't do it there's always that chance i don't know but i would say that you know for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated it would be kind of hard for you know you know what i'm saying like yeah so uh i uh-huh exactly uh i'm not sure about Pennsylvania whether we have it or not for some reason i was thinking that we do but it's you know it's not very often i think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that that anyone anyone from Pennsylvania had gotten it i don't do you know if Virginia has it uh-huh i know Florida has it uh-huh yeah uh you know yeah but it's funny that uh i mean like you know like i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for Pennsylvania i'm not even sure of that but for some reason i think that you know it was something like that and it surprised and even Florida i know they have it and you don't really hear about it real often how many people yeah but you you think that i mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed you know compared to that and to how many people are being sent that doesn't seem like very many yeah everyone would appeal that's true too uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah uh-huh and then they get out yeah they get out in three years on probation and they do it again you know it's like a slap on the fingers for them i don't i don't uh i- i don't i think that it should be i mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone a murder then i think you know that they should likewise you know someone should take their life also but uh but are are you would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder yeah uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah i think some of them would rather be in jail yeah they probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets i don't know uh i was just going to say something i forgot what it was oh i don't even remember what it was now in Clarion well i live in Butler but i'm at c[ollege]- i'm at college i'm at Clarion University yeah uh-huh see yeah okay well see i'm i'm in kind i'm in kind okay uh we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus yeah and that would be pushing it so i mean this is definitely a college town um we're about two hours north of Pittsburgh if that would help you out any um north of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania oh i've never heard of Polk but oh i never heard of that it might have a new name yeah yeah we're probably about an hour away from Sharon uh-huh uh so i most of the kids here i you know like you know just from dorm mates and stuff they'll say that they don't believe in it but then after i would say my point of view then they'll say well yeah you know you know yeah you know i think people can be persuaded one way or another i've never seriously ran into someone i mean like other than my priest you know who definitely says you can't take a you know you can't take anyone's life um anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance um-hum yeah uh-huh yeah but you know i look at that and say well they should have thought about that beforehand you know uh-huh uh-huh yeah that's something you know but uh wh[ether]- whether they plea bargain or not if they're guilty of murder they're guilty of murder you know so i don't think that they deserve anything less it's just i don't i don't know i just uh-huh and that costs money yeah uh-huh yeah	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

i was afraid for a while she wasn't going to find anyone because they were all out on the golf course oh yeah i oh no yeah well near Dallas you're used to playing golf in the wind too the biggest problem with it i think is time yeah and i i know that it's a four hour dedication it could be four hour relaxation or it could be gritting on your nerves which you're using that much time uh and not not having that much fun you know and i- i played tennis for exercise but i play golf for fun uh and apparently it's the attitude that you have that makes the big difference the uh i- i enjoy catching it too do you ever go out to the uh-huh uh-huh i keep wondering why i you can understand in sports like uh basketball or baseball or football there's an age uh position in there but i keep wondering why some of the real legends can't go just a little bit longer than they do right it the regular tour and they do mix some of them mix it but it's uh it it does amaze me sometimes just to see it i don't know whether it's a lack of concentration or particular muscle development or what but it seems to be uh i to me it's not a sport that you would be overwhelmed with muscle activity in it um-hum um-hum i tell you what it's a sport that has a great number of jokes though i as i said i play tennis and there are no tennis jokes i don't know if you can think of one at all but but there are a slew of golf jokes so it it indicated and it's great uh sport for equalizing the handicap system allows you to play competitively even though you don't play on the same level play competitively with just about anyone you know i can go out and stand a chance of winning a dime off of Jack Nicholas uh if the handicap system uh worked properly and it should so it's nice to be able to to uh compete and and be together with someone and yet have a basis for competitiveness such as uh ten cent be anything over a a dime i joke on so oh yes oh yeah well you know that's one of the other things i i'd i'm am fascinated sometimes two sports bring it to mind more quickly than any others but all the other functions that the human body performs really are are uh as equally amazing But when you start thinking about the eye hand coordination and trying to get a little sphere uh four hundred and twenty yards away into a little whole in about four shots and it's true you have loft of club and everything else but knowing how far to bring it back and the the concentration and all the things that go on in the human body to get it there yeah the same the same thing is true with basketball where a a fellows running along and runs and jumps up in the air and then pushes the basketball toward uh a hoop and it swishes through th[e]- th[e]- the human body is amazing and i think i'd like to see uh elements like that in almost everything i do and golf uh i walk down the fairways sometimes just thinking about that and then of course i'll miss the putt but we just moved here from from Oklahoma as a matter of fact and i'd been in Oklahoma for twenty years up in Enid but so uh i'm used to the wind too in fact that's the onl[y]- that areas the only place i know of that you really have to uh consider the wind on putts out on the grass green and everything else but the wind effect oh i know it i know we had just moved to Charlotte and uh i've gone to a couple of uh public courses uh we haven't settled in here yet we're just here temporarily but a the courses are beautiful and you can play just about year round on it too now Richardson maybe you can too yeah yeah in fact uh the last few years i've had in Oklahoma i went to Norman and it would play New Year's day down there now there it was stretching the imagination to enjoy it but at least i played uh-huh uh-huh well i have enjoyed talking to you yeah yeah yeah well that that's a good sport when people enjoy it because it can be very social at the same time good luck on the course bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

hi this is Judy i'm from Maryland and i'm in California visiting right now oh okay i'm sitting here going oh dear should we give it a try okay well um what changes have you seen well actually that's what i was thinking too and um you know just to jump ahead a little bit but then we can back up is it perhaps women in politics is for the future because_1 i don't see that really yet in positions of power really ah that's true that's true um do you work in private corporation or government ah um-hum um-hum oh are you that's the best status yes um i don't i see um in a government and i work in academia before and um actually there's one um woman in our i don't know what you'd call it uh institute who is a manager and i mean in a sense perhaps um a lot of she gets protected a lot because uh it's almost like a token and and it's sort of unfortunate because i think that they don't accept her technically and but she's a good paper pusher and it's in a technical position really and you know she should be more technical for what she does and i think that's sort of unfortunate because it doesn't it doesn't really help the cause in the um but um you know i don't know and and teaching i still see that that's where most of the women are in teaching and you know and it's always been that way right not well uh-huh um-hum not department chairmen yeah not the deans and things like that um-hum um-hum hum and do you think it's because women aren't qualified or or just don't or don't want the job or just aren't hired for the jobs uh-huh they're just not selected somehow um-hum um-hum uh-huh oh okay but i'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering act[ually]- but you know i say that but yet i know two yeah i'm sure there are yeah um-hum yeah i mean the two that i know obviously are not in teaching but um it's it i suppose in a since i was surprised when they told me they m[ajored]- majored in engineering i don't know why i but i don't know that many men that have majored in engineering either i mean it's just because i'm in the humanities it's just you know it's not not something that i tend to hear about but um yeah it's uh oh that's interesting yeah yeah i mean i- i suppose that that it's difficult to really say why because you know there there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified and maybe there aren't you know maybe they don't apply for the right right which could be you know partial partially cultural anyway so that it might be circularly being the same problem of of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway so why spend your time getting qualified it's a it's a rough it's a rough a rough situation um and i guess what i what ama[zes]- amazes me is the number of men who are willing to stay home with the kids or and in our case we actually have one father who works part-time a six hour day so that he can take the kids kids or kid i'm not sure to school in the morning and be home when the children or child comes home in the afternoon this is uh well see i don't know anything about the family but but yeah i would imagine she might um because he's y[ou]- you know he's a really nice guy but he did say that because he was in the humanities and he's now working in more of a technical situation that he had trouble finding a job so that maybe he you know maybe she was more qualified but st[ill]- but still it's interesting that you know he he's been doing this evidently for a a good number of years and but it's unusual uh-huh yeah i oh he was even before they had children oh now that that really is oh she was uh-huh uh-huh yeah i mean i think that would be it would it would strike one as strange if there's no reason for somebody to stay home that yeah but but yet you know we have to think about that because if if she had opted to stay home we wouldn't have thought anything stran[ge]- so so we're carrying our own prejudice yeah oh gee i guess we can't win because yeah if if somebody does it and breaks tradition you're surprised but oh dear so so could get away with it oh dear you know well i mean it it's an interesting topic yet i must say it's not one that i've given a great deal of of thought to but um in the past it's um one of those things that you know seems to happen i don't i don't feel for the most part that i've been discriminated against no i was a department chairman i d[on't]- but i don't like administration so then i'm uh uh probably a poor example although you know i was an administrator and could still be i suppose uh-huh oh really you were you were more ambitious than they would let you be yeah yeah well i would uh oh jeez yeah actually in a since i suppose when i was hired into the government um at i was taken advantage of and and that's true that you know sometimes other people get get higher increments for you know even right right that's probably true i hadn't i hadn't thought about it because i do like what i do and i just sort of ignore the administrative part of it since i didn't like it when when i had to do it so i- i figure you know nobody must uh nobody must like it it must be a rotten job for everybody but i know some people thrive on it oh gee well since i don't have a whole lot more to say on the topic	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

now we have to talk about the savings and loans scandal do you have any strong opinions on that uh what are yours well i think there's a lot to be said for that point of view i i really think that congress turned on the taps and then there were lots of people there to carry away the water um well right he'll pay for it absolutely that uh-huh i think that would've been a much smarter way to handle it and the another thing that would've helped a lot would be to make certain that the people who were going to use the money that we were providing should've had there own at stake they should've have a lot more of their own capital on the line when they can leverage just a very small investment into millions of dollars worth of tax payers money and it's turning out to be a lot more than that and they have absolutely no incentive to uh treat it prudently they just uh hand it over to anybody who walks in and asks for it um-hum they have nothing to lose and everything to gain you see you know can keep lending and keep growing then they can take the big salaries and have the all the perks and uh entertainment and so forth and then oh if people don't pay them back it's no skin off their nose they just um-hum yes they don't they don't lose anything well uh i don't know what could've been done other than the uh insurance regulation but i certainly think that was a mistake and the um i also think it was a mistake to reimburse all depositors over a hundred thousand dollars when they were told up-front that that was was was the limit because uh the promise is yeah the promises don't mean anything now when the uh people put millions of dollars in some shaky operation uh they figure the tax payers will bail them out because they have hm absolutely uh i would've been in a little danger of uh you know i would've had to be very careful about where i put my money but i certainly would have been alert and i would not have just been chasing the highest percentage return on a CD yeah uh i don't think that'd be any great loss we could do without a few of they don't seem to be providing very much useful uh service to people absolutely um-hum yes you would and uh uh i don't see why the for large sums of money why it should be any different from investing in a CD i- i mean in a uh mutual fund or a money market fund or something like that uh there are no guarantees on them you uh you trust that the broker won't sell because certain brokerage houses will guarantee at least up to a certain point the investments in the funds that they manage but uh then you're uh just at the mercy of them because they could go under that's right yeah um-hum well uh do you think that we're heading for another uh debacle of this sort in the uh insurance industry and we see um-hum well i don't know how we're going to bail them out because if we're already how many trillion dollars in the hole where's the money going to come from and yet the we've got this enormous uh first executive insurance company just sailing out here in California and um maybe the people who uh bought term insurance aren't going to lose anything except a few months premium but all those um people who have money invested in uh uh annuities for their retirement are going to be up a creek and i don't know who's going to bail them out there al[ready]- there already a few companies that had switched over from their own private plans to the first executive annuities that are not getting their benefit checks this time and the the state governor is saying that we're going to protect those people but how are we going to do that where the state itself is already in hock uh we're running thirteen million dollars no billion sorry thirteen billion dollars in the hole for the next fiscal year and you know we've got to come up with that money because_1 states can't run a deficit the way the federal government can and they're going to have to be laying people off out here in the state some of i think anybody will but when it gets down to teachers and cops it make a difference well the yeah i think that's absolutely they keep all their fancy uh perks in the legislature and they uh still do their and they still have all their uh i think it's something like twenty five uh people on the payroll per a legislator yeah i i came fr[om]- out here to California from Texas and i can very well remember people trying to change the Texas legislature to meet every year instead of every other year as the Texas constitution requires and people consistently voted it down and since they i really feel that way about the California ones too tha[t]- i- i think that if they could all just take about a five year vacation and let things settle down maybe we could figure out what exactly we need and start over but anyway uh-huh yep i i would vote for that well it's been interesting talking to you and i think we're in pretty much agreement on this thanks for talking uh bye bye	0 0 0 0 0 0

can you speak up please yes uh but they will accept you later in life also yeah after your children are grown yes no no i'm not some of the people that have been involved with Peace Corps among other things were retired teachers uh there was a retired plumber that went to uh uh Uruguay i think and helped them quite a bit with concepts in plumbing you know providing for a for better public hygiene yeah but so do you think that people should be required to give a couple years for the good of the country why well i understand but if it were told to us that we would find the time somewhere between our seventeenth and uh twenty sixth birthday to give a year or two to the to the country in the form of maybe building better roads or the parks service or the Peace Corps or someth[ing]- you know the military service or something wouldn't we have uh maybe a better class of Americans a lot of these peop[le]- a lot of our uh pardon the terminology but yuppies now are interested in one thing and one thing only and that's themselves and at least if you legislated giving for a couple years of their lives or or uh a actually purely giving but but some sort of equitable exchange then at least the country would have gotten two years from them where hum they would have given something to the country instead of take taking away all their lives uh give them your ti[me]- give them your entire life for two years no it will be a job of sorts i'm sure that the Peace Corps pays it doesn't pay well it's not top wages but but it does pay the military for young hiring in soldiers does pay it doesn't pay well okay currently in our country especially in some regions there's an employment problem you're aware of that i'm sure and Texas Instruments you know in in another time we had the WPA Works Progress Administration during the great depression though i can't see why it was great uh that gave people pay that was halfway between relief which was welfare and the minimum wage in trade for money and and living they gave them_1 food and uniforms and uh here in Colorado you'll find a great many things public roads that were worked on by the WPA uh dams that were built by the WPA uh scenic overlooks parks we are road our road system's falling apart our our national road system system of highways and roads is falling apart the[re]- there's a lot of work to be done i i can't see the problem in it for a year the what what i'm saying is that if it were mandatory that every person right after graduation from high school that were able bodied would give a year well or not give a year but but trade a year then they at least one not more than say three or four then it would definitely effect unemployment i don't know well you know Texas New Mexico Colorado huge numbers of other western states have no real welfare system there's Aid to Dependent Children and Aid to Mothers of Dependent Children but there's no real welfare system but if we took these people off off the streets for a year there would darn sure be more hours labor available in the nation for everyone else and who knows maybe some of our graduating high school seniors m[ight]- would find out a little bit more the what the traditional American work ethic means you know we have had some problem with that in recent years uh they wish only for the paycheck really producing yeah be it selling drugs or whatever yeah yeah and maybe if we instilled the work ethic you know i enjoy the i enjoy working	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay well i- i definitely think it's our the cars we drive and i think you know everyone has good intentions and and thinks well i should carpool and i will and but that we just have so many different interests and so many different things we have to do it's it's a bother to have to pick somebody up and if you have a doctor's appointment or something and they have to get another ride home or you have to arrange it's just a hassle and i guess we're not willing to do that but that to me is probably the thing that needs to be done or to start using public D[allas]- Dallas area i live in Plano which is just a a suburb of of Dallas do you live in a major city oh okay no well myself i- i go to Richardson which is a i teach school and so i don't commute that far it's only about four miles but the majority of people that live in this area go into Dallas to work and and when you if you go out on the freeway and you look you see almost every car is just one passenger and our public transportation system's a joke so people just don't bother to take that because it's inconvenient we don't have any kind of a a train or uh you know anything like some of the big cities do we're supposed to get one but it's you know way off in the future but no it's just it oh is that right well sure how large is Raleigh so it's pretty big yeah uh-huh and so you ride your bike to work and everything or aren't you oh well that's great see that's yeah that isn't even i mean i'm not sure that a pers[on]- even a of of of people in the Dallas area ride bikes to work you know i just don't think they do i never see anybody um another thing that that i think our my family's real conscious of is is is to stop using aerosol cans and you know uh you know get an[other]- find another way instead of you know the pump i know it really is and we just need not to buy the stuff and those businesses will have to change you know the corporations and so forth have to change if you don't buy it they're not going to make it so yeah that is an easy one but uh you know and i notice probably a lot of uh commercial pollution and and factory pollution in Dallas you can see it some days it's really bad yeah it's yeah it's awful it's nothing like California where the smog is constant but it's still there and you know it if we i think if we really realized how much we do breathe in that's unhealthy we would immediately do something about it but i don't think people realize how unhealthy the the air is yes well i think i don't see i only teach English and and uh but the science teacher i teach fifth grade and we're departmentalized and the science teacher does a really big unit on it and i think the kids are more informed than adults are i mean and uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh they do they do and they and and i think that they are they care a little bit more and i think as adults we need to care because it's the the future for our kids and i you know i mean my kids are much more aware than i was at their age about things like that and i think it's it's definitely has to be that no it really wasn't it wasn't a problem it i mean it pro[bably]- i'm sure it was beginning to be a problem but people were just weren't uh aware of it like they are today and i think that's where it has to start with the kids because it's going to be their world soon and i think it and and we're real big on you know Plano which is a small suburb of Dallas about a hundred thousand um i think we're more than that about a hundred thirty thousand now but um they're really trying their best to start recycling and things like that that will and we just we have separate garbage collections now for plastics and cans and newspaper and which i think is i mean that's that should be just a way of life for everybody you shouldn't even complain about it you should just do it uh-huh that's true you're right you're right well you know it just has to be when you consider the landfills we we're not going to have any soon and it's it's ridiculous but the thing that the quandary that i'm in is that that we had a great big article in in in the newspaper last week about i've been real big about going to to the store and asking for paper instead of plastic well that is really controversial because some scientists you know feel like plastic i mean paper is worse than plastic it's just it's just a real um debate about which one is is the best really the best thing to do is to bring um you know a cloth bag yeah do you yeah i see that's what i do too i forget and and besides when i go to the store i have a family you know i- i get maybe ten twelve bags of groceries and that would be a little a little expensive although you know i'm sure some um-hum yeah um-hum yes that's right that's right you're right uh-huh well you know and they say that you know plastic is recyclable but not many people use them_1 again you know yeah that's true sure sure i think that you know i think that it's tremendous the research they're doing on all of this because i think we need to to know and be more aware of it so we can do some changing but the majority of people are so lazy about it that they're not willing to to sacrifice a little to to make the world a better place and it's kind of sad because especially_1 if you have children and because_1 you know you want your kids and their kids to to be able to be a part of a yeah a world that's halfway decent and you know just in my lifetime i've seen such a change in the environment and it's scary because by the time my kids have kids and they're growing up it's going to be a completely different world you know and it's it's scary so you know like i- i know that i need to carpool and i don't and uh and i you rationalize and say well i only am four miles away and that it's no big deal and well you know but right right well you know just yeah just with with our thing in Plano it had w[hen]- recycling garbage it hasn't it hasn't been that long and it was just uh really an easy adjustment for most people but there was a f[ew]- small percentage that griped and complained and wrote you know letters to the editor and you know like it was some real great big deal inconvenience and but it seems to me you should just be able to give up a little bit to make the world better but some people don't think that so and some people don't and some people i think really believe and maybe they're rationalizing but they really believe that everybody's making a bigger deal out of the problem than it is and that and that it's right no way it's it's there and we've got to face it that's right i think in some cases they aren't and i see i wonder h[ow]- i wonder how much the laws that Congress passed several years ago are really enforced as far as big companies and oh i think so too and i think that they're not fined the way they should be or they're they pay them_1 off or whatever so they can get away with it i- i was born in Ohio and when um when i was young we d[id]- we did a lot of fishing and on Lake Erie and i i mean when i went back i just couldn't believe the difference it's just terrible the way it's polluted because of of big corporations that dump and and you know and you just feel so bad because at one time it was a wonderful beautiful lake and now it's a mess yeah i when i was little my dad had a boat and we would go fishing on Lake Erie and it was beautiful and it's not beautiful anymore so and that's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

all right um what kind of recent camping experience do you have um-hum right oh that's good yeah i- i think it's uh it's a lot of fun uh my camping experiences have been mostly with my son who was in the scouts he's he's huh he thinks he's an adult now but uh we started camping with the cub scouts and uh camped uh you know for several years with the with the Boy Scouts and and went to some of the scout uh camp sites around and we've had really had a good time uh with that oh yeah um-hum yeah but uh our first uh first camping experience was uh the fathers took the the uh Webelows i guess it was camping uh and we went over to uh a lake over in East Texas and w[e]- my son and i borrowed a one of these pop up trailer tents and it rained it started raining about the time we left home and it rained uh like that was a Saturday morning and it rained all day Saturday and it was still raining Sunday morning we went over and set up camp and you know stayed there over night we couldn't do anything so as soon as we woke up Sunday morning we you know we had breakfast and then we all came back home but i think he and i were the only ones that stayed high and dry so to but uh most of the most of our camping experiences have been you know pup tent type of you know little two men tents on the ground and sleeping in a bed roll you know and that kind of thing so it's uh um-hum oh yeah tha[t]- tha[t]- that's always bad when the tent falls you in the middle of the night yeah right yeah you need to be on higher ground sometime you don't want the if th[ere]- if it's going to rain you don't want the water to run down into your tents so but uh yeah we had we've had some really good experiences i[t]- it's been several years since i've been camping but uh as a matter of fact my son uh is camping now he camps every weekend he he's uh involved with the uh Scarborough Fair down at Waxahachie and he goes down there on uh Sa[turday]- on uh Friday night and camps and stays uh Friday night and Saturday night and then comes back home after it closes Sunday so he has a tent that's i guess he's got a permanent tent site for his tent stays down there all week you know and he just goes down and spends the weekend down there so he's really having a good time camping and and you know his experiences that he got from scouting have really you know been good for him uh from that he he lost interest in scouts but he still uses what he learned so yeah yeah you know you uh do you do the cooking in the coals where you wrap everything in foil and but yeah that's we uh my my wife and i took the uh the scout leadership training program and we really had a good time with that we did have a uh i guess it was a raccoon that came into our campsite and stole some of the food you know that have set up i think it actually went into the tent with uh with a couple of ladies that were in our group you know went in an and got stuff out of their tent but uh but th[ey]- uh you know it was uh it was a fun time and we we've enjoyed camping what you know what little we've done uh we're not right yeah we uh we went uh one time one time with a uh another group or with the the scouting group but it was the parents uh you know it was a family camp out and one of the things was that uh the uh we had uh uh a couple that were uh from India and they demonstrated cooking some Indian food out you know on a on a little gas burner type thing out there you know it was part of our our entertainment you know for the thing they cooked some kind of uh of an Indian uh pastry type thing on a in a

uh-huh are you saying the teachers or the parents uh-huh well i guess i have mixed emotions on one hand i think golly the pay isn't good enough if you didn't really want to do it it's probably something else out there but on the other hand i think that maybe some people have thought that was kind of an easy way out you can major in something basically useless to the world as a whole like say Spanish or geography geography being one of my favorite subjects but nevertheless it's not exactly the thing that's going to make you bucks but you could then go ahead and get a teaching certificate and perhaps feed your family a little uh you're calling from Texas then i'm in Plano um-hum um-hum well i have always believed in sharing you know if my neighbor next door was hungry and they needed something to eat or something to wear i'd be glad to share and so i guess in the global sense you have to have that kind of feeling to a certain extent but i also don't believe that people who get funds or equipment or anything without some of their own personal input take care of it nicely or appreciate it or use it properly uh those things have to be taught so you know so there's that end of it too an[d]- and i think it's going to really you know so i don't i don't say that in a selfish way because i think there that it's probably not totally equitable and i don't know that there is a good situation entirely but golly it sure going to make a big difference in our school system you know it uh i was um-hum i was talking to a friend in Irving who sits on a parents advisory council with the Irving Independent School District and she was saying they are number one they are adding next year they are adding thirty minutes to their school day in order to accommodate the extra teaching that's going to be needed because they're eliminating all aids they're going to th[ey]- all aids all paid aids everything is going to have to be volunteer through the parent teacher organizations and frankly we're all ready {maxed} out with parent you know uh volunteer work i work part-time out of my home and they did you know i'm always getting called and you know and used utilized you know what i'm willing to do it but i know during the days when i was uh just not a working mom at all it was ridiculous uh yeah yeah until i just finally had to say i am so sorry that you know just cannot do everything for you but uh you know so there's and and the moms that work a lot of times just can't help at all and yeah um-hum so many yes well and just you know the yearbook and the T-shirt and the teachers presents and the you know it really starts you know we have five children so i know that it really you know um-hum i just helped a little girl yesterday a teenager friend of ours she had to prepare something for to study Greece and they were i think she needed a recipe and the history of of the recipe or the type of food and also um had to actually make it and bring it enough to serve you know fifteen people and i found the cheapest thing i could find that i could help her with and even so figuring it up i think she spent close to twenty dollars um and it was say you know we did a couple of different ones and it was the least expensive and and still be able to fix it at home and tote it up there and what not so but that's yeah it's a lot of money yeah and would they really eat it of course that's not really the you know the quality of education but you know i think that probably you know here in Plano we are uh of course state legislature you know added uh five days next year and uh i think we're going to be seeing alternative calendar very soon i i'm still basically against it although i i do understand the positives that are you know touted but i think overall there is a quality of excellence expected here it's very difficult for the children in this school district to excel in more than one area because if you get into drama if you get into speech if you get into drill team or athletics or whatever it is i mean they want you night and day they want your time they want your blood so and uh you know i have children who been fortunate enough to be in in these extra curricular things but golly you know it's just really you know it's like a smaller school system you know you could be in the drill team and you could be cheerleader too and you could be you know on the football team and still be on the basketball team and still try out for band you know so you know that and you you can't do that in this school system so you know we've been working on college stuff for my oldest daughter and shoot you know that uh you know you kind of you know you have to to look when we were writing things down i said you know you can't really talk about all your individual things but you know you've got to make sure that when you put down band here that it's not just any old band that this is a band that took this honor and that honor and participated in this competition and participated in that competition so they understand really well yeah this is uh this is interesting interesting topic thank you Jackie have a good day

okay what i was gonna to tell you about is that my fiance and i have just finished as a matter of fact today restoring a seventy three Mercedes i- i we've done a little bit of it ourselves but mostly we were lucky enough to find a a guy that works for a Mercedes dealership and he restores cars on his on his uh you know off time well it was uh a gentleman that works with my fiance and he had bought it for his daughter and she wasn't taking care of it and boy was that obvious when they pulled up it had been really um it was in a mess it was just in a terrible mess uh well the last thing we did to it was today they had uh replaced the gear shift um it's uh it wasn't we had to order the part from the dealership and the guys put it in today when you shifted it down you didn't know if you were in park drive reverse so that was the very last thing that we had to uh had to have done uh basically the whole car's been redone they put in new um they used new sheet metal and stuff to to repair the body i mean there were you know these rusted dents a new paint job they uh redid all of the trim we had the seats reupholstered we put in a new dash it's been recarpeted it's just it was you know just com[pletely]- yeah it was completely overhauled and uh for what it's a diesel um-hum it sure is yeah you're right um-hum yeah yeah and it's it's just been lovingly restored that's one good thing about about having somebody to do it your you're you're there because they worked on it here at our home i have no idea i- i doubt that anybody will ever really know well i- i- i can't really remember what it shows on there but i remember when we discussed it we said that we were pretty sure that that was like times maybe or a[dd]- an additional one hundred on to that a hundred thousand yeah because it's uh it had definitely been through the mill but uh uh-huh oh yeah um-hum um-hum oh my gosh you've had it oh my word uh-huh um-hum um-hum oh my word uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh replaced yeah yeah oh definitely oh gosh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah uh-huh gosh that's unbelievable hum uh-huh right right um-hum um-hum that's am[azing]- that is amazing is it the same engine that's been in it all the time um-hum um-hum um-hum wow uh-huh yeah yeah that's amazing yeah yeah so the car was how old when you when you bought it um-hum um-hum yeah oh i see um-hum um-hum uh-huh yeah exactly yeah uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah oh is it does say that on the can i didn't realize that uh-huh um-hum um-hum yeah um-hum right um-hum oh i see yeah that's amazing yeah and this is a Maverick you said Maverick well i had uh i had owned a Cougar up until oh just several months ago that i had had since uh um i think it was an eighty two or something and i had that car only uh about two years and the engine blew in it and so i had to put in a new engine that was that's an experience when you have a two year old car you know and it wasn't in warranty th[en]- i mean it must have like the day after the warranty was expired it must have exploded i have no i[dea]- uh V is it V eight i don't i don't know a lot of what's the biggest one is a V eight bigger yeah that's what it had in it and yeah so it it uh that's my latest experience with something major yeah yeah well see that's what i was thinking i thought maybe it has something because that turned me off from American cars i mean you know someth[ing]- a[nd]- and i'm sure i shouldn't i shouldn't feel that way that's why i was surprised to hear you talk about this car it sounds very resilient whatever they have in that en[gine]- whatever a kind of engine it is in that car yeah yeah yeah maybe it has something to do but i- i know i took good care of it i changed the oil quite often i didn't even do that myself i- i could never do any of this myself you know i'm just not uh i'm not uh yeah and it still blew up well now that yeah oh really you would never have a problem well you know that's possible i never had thought about it but that's my i'm i have a what what does that do uh-huh oh okay just like just like sugar would it turns syrupy um-hum um-hum yeah yeah yeah ugh well that maybe that's what happened to it because it had been it had been fine but the odd thing about it was is after i had that engine replaced that car ran hot every summer i mean even though yes Texas is notorious i mean we it's true we have a hundred and eight degree days but you know it uh i had i had trouble with that car after that i don't know if it was just a lemon even though it was a brand new engine you know so uh yeah course it was a brand new engine supposedly now that's what the dealership told me you know yeah yeah that's what i- i know my i had uh had my dad t[o]- finally took it down there because i would take it back and forth and the dealership would not it was i still had the problem it just continued and continued and they would charge me you know two hundred dollars every time they looked at it and um he kept saying the same thing he said it seems like it was your thermostat but at any rate it was really never rectified and i told the people that when i sold it to them_1 i said you know you you might need to watch out but they didn't seem to mind they wanted the car so you know as far as my ability to do anything on it i can check the oil i know as it goes it's been amazing to watch these guys work on this car i mean you know just from well it just this this gentleman had this car and uh you know he had he had told my fiance that he was going to sell it i mean he just i mean he sold it to us for like three hundred bucks you know and and we took before we said we'd buy it we uh took it to a Mercedes dealership and they looked at the engine and uh the engine had been rebuilt about uh i think the guy had told us two hundred miles previously or something and they said it you know the engine alone was worth you know much more than that so we didn't feel like there was any problem and uh it's it's definitely been amazing to to see the transformation we took we took after pictures it's a shame that we didn't take before pictures because yeah it was just uh as i said rusted dents and the color was that dark dark green that's almost	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

uh-huh oh uh-huh yeah uh-huh around there huh well you're you're just a youngster then i passed the fifty so i guess our topic's going to be changes in the women's roles so it should be real interesting so you think we're ready okay uh you want to start off um-hum um very much yeah yeah yes um-hum um-hum um-hum i think all things get started sometimes in that manner you know they come in that way um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum i hadn't thought much about that but that is true that's uh-huh some of them no no um very much um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum hum um-hum yeah not no they they hurt themselves a little bit in that way um um-hum there you go there's a lot of truth in that yeah um-hum that's right um-hum yes it shouldn't be destroyed yeah yeah um-hum um-hum yeah yeah yeah well that's kind of makes it exciting you know um-hum well i think now when both are working they have a more ch[ance]- more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way yeah right right yeah because_1 you get set in your ways and it's really hard to to really to get help uh d[id]- you know to get the work load shared yes uh-huh our i we have five children they're they're all grown and on their own so they're uh uh how do you mean uh we have uh two girls and three boys and our our baby girl just had a baby girl last week was her first baby so it's been real exciting um-hum um-hum yeah have you been that way long eight just eight years that's that's a long eight years though uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh that makes a big difference uh-huh um-hum um-hum uh-huh uh-huh yeah well probably your role and and the way you are also has changed though you know compared to what it would have been like say twenty fifty years ago hm um-hum um-hum um-hum um the best you can yes i yeah that's the only thing i worry about is the the child's love and security that i think that's being damaged um a lot um-hum i do too i- i think uh now some some women can can do both they're very capable of working and and a um-hum um-hum it it really is yeah um-hum so many have to work to make a go of it it seems or they say they do anyways and eh but i think ones that don't have to the it's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there well that could be um-hum um-hum oh yeah yeah you mean it's stronger there much stronger yeah yeah ye[ah]- right right right um-hum yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ah uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh um um right but but they're both yeah they're both different people too that's that's where the trouble lies some people some people can adjust and have both do both well and others can't uh well uh i have one daughter that works full-time she has two little boys and they seem to do fine she has been talk[ing]- has talked about quitting you know and staying home for a few years but then it's real hard because she's got an excellent job uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
all right uh i guess what i feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that it there's got to be something when when we pay so much for the for the debt instead of using the money for where it ought to go it it's just it's ridiculous What kills me is when they had a chance to to uh put into ac[tion]- action the the G[ramm]- the G[ramm]- Rud[man]- what is it uh the act where they had to cut everything across the board they kept doing they kept putting off doing that why did they do that that's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together oh yeah i think so too yeah well things like mailings they don't use any kind of restraint on some of these things they just think once they get there that they can do just anything you know they don't they don't try to uh to conserve and of course here at home we end up conserving and conserving and i mean when i don't have money i don't buy something they sure don't seem to there're a couple of things i think we need to really work for and i don't know quite how to do it but i think we need to have the one line uh uh veto so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything if it's a good idea it can be done again you know and if it's not so what at least you haven't thrown out all the work they've done for months and months and months and months yeah this is that's right yeah yeah that's just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on and the trouble is you don't you have so little input about it you don't know enough to know what what to do about some of this stuff i yeah that's right the other thing about is i think uh limiting their time in office would be good i- i just can't believe there aren't other people out there that could do just as well as what we've got yeah yeah i think that's right yeah wouldn't that be too bad well that's right i think i don't know i think uh people in general the the the the idea of what you need to to exist is so outrageous that it's not hardly you know it starts at the courts it starts everywhere until we can't we've just lost control of of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable you know no you can't even can't even conceive of what they're talking about yeah yeah i mean it jus[t]- and and you just the other thing is it's it's all very well to give money to help people other people and i think we need to do that but there are they need to put more limits on them they need to restrain about what they do yeah i- i you know i think that's probably un[less]- unless we can afford it if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again you know i don't really mind helping people but you you need to get rid of this thing that's that's just uh eating us up you know and get things on a on an even if it were if it were a family we'd be up before the the magistrate for for doing all these wicked things you know but the government does it and it's all right yeah that's true well sounds like yeah it's good to see them_1 doing some things there anyway yeah well i think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens we're going to have to bite the bullet and we're all going to have to do it i it just isn't fair though that when this happens in some places it needs to all come off everywhere that's why i thought well you know this is the time they need to put that into act[ion]- into action and show they mean business that they've got to cut they've got to cut costs yeah i think that's right well i don't i don't really mind paying taxes for for positive things that are helps like roads and making sure that uh that water is safe and some of these things but um you know it you just feel like it's out of control you feel like they do not have control of it and that and so then it just aggravates you you know you think i could spend my money i could help the poor people better by myself than they're doing so it's yeah well i think that's right if they don't do if they don't if they don't pull it in and start doing something i think they're really going to have to i think yeah yeah yeah in some ways we're awful lucky i guess there a lot of lot of places where it's worse than it is here but still you don't want it to get that bad good heavens no we need to get try to get hold of it and and have it be things be honest and and i guess in the fact i don't really mind paying taxes but i would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent that they're doing something that's positive for for somebody i don't really feel like uh i don't really feel like i use taxes don't know maybe i do more than i- i guess i do i use them in the in roads and lot of things but uh yeah yeah they've done some good things the state actually did some good good work on that in that a couple of years ago uh Sam Johnson came out and talked to us about that bout what they had done and they they really had done some good some good work yeah yeah there are a lot of p[laces]- places where they're in real trouble and and i think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too if they don't take if they don't take that early stand yeah that's probably right the growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait -[un]til something -[un]til they need them_1 well it's good to talk to you oh about nine no i just just a housewife i just heard about it and found it fun guess i like to talk that's right uh-huh bye now	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

tell me what books you read um i try to avoid the uh-huh um-hum um-hum that does cut into your reading time a lot yeah well my my kids are up and out of the house now so you know i'll uh encourage you that you do get uh a little more time to yourself later on i won't say lots yeah oh uh well i read for a living uh i'm an editor and so i i'm at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and therefore i read uh psychology sociology anthropology political science philosophy linguistics history uh yeah and you name it i've read some of it it really is it it's a great place to be and the uh it's nice to work with people uh who are not required to use your services and so therefore are grateful and not arguing y[ou]- with you about them if they don't want an editor they don't come hum no we don't uh normally we don't publish uh things under our own imprint uh we have had books that are written here that are then published by all sorts of different uh commercial and academic publishers and university presses so uh i end up sometimes reading the things that are written here all the way through sometimes just a few chapters because that's as far as they get but i also get of course lots of references to neat stuff to read about so i'm uh i was just thinking when they told me the topic i should just i should read the uh titles of the five books that are sitting on my desk right now that i'm in the middle of i'm reading uh Within the Plantation Household which is a history uh sort of a sociological history of southern women black and white living on plantations uh a book called Poisons of the Past which is about ergotisms that uh fungus that grows on rye it causes the uh uh Saint Anthony's Fire Disease where people fell into fits and there is a a theory at least that a lot of people who were accused of witchcraft were actually under the influence of ergot and a book called Job Cues Gender Cues which explains uh how certain professions and vocations get uh flip flopped from one gender predominance to the other like uh nursing started out all men and then in the nineteenth century began to have women and now it's practically all women and that uh that's right and the thing that changed that was the manual typewriter but then it became you see just sort of a clerical task whereas when you wrote it out in long hand you were a yes you were a confidential assistant to the person right and then i've got a book called Fashions in Science which is a sociology that explains uh why certain theories get to be popular in uh sociology and uh how difficult it is to swim against the tide if you have a different idea that isn't vatted by your peers and then i have one novel that's called First Light that's about uh archeology the British novel so it's it's really quite interesting i haven't got too far into it yet uh those are all books that are out uh published and bound now but they're just things that uh pertain to various things i'm working on or were uh mentioned prominently and attracted my curiosity so i got them_1 out of the library and decided i'd read some more in them so i read a lot of history and uh a few novels an occasional mystery stories just for fun um-hum oh yeah yeah oh hey that's a nifty idea great oh i think the the boom to parents and the the shoelace department was those little Velcro tabs i think that's incredibly um-hum yeah um-hum what do you think is the most promising or practical book uh of that kind you've read recently hum um-hum yeah i knew his literary agent in Houston when she was just uh convincing him to write all this down he was teaching yeah i s[aw]- i saw one of those episodes on PBS uh from time to time out here we have four different PBS channels that we can get on the cable and they'll have all ten of those shown back to back in the middle of the for people can video tape them yeah um-hum hm um-hum oh yes oh oh there's some absolutely wonderful illustrated children's books yeah um-hum e[xactly]- right uh well i read the Publisher's Weekly uh which lists all the upcoming books forthcoming books and uh there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful but i was tickled to see that some publisher is uh reprinting those the James Thurber books for children the Wonderful O and The Thirteen Clocks that have been out of print for about oh i think about twenty years well i had those for my kids and they really did enjoy them oh but they were old copies then i didn't buy them when my kids were little and so they probably were out of print all of already when my kids were small but um i was really happy to see that yeah i guess it's in honor of his hundredth	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

no that was DC yeah it was Mayor of DC yes he is but it was uh Mayor Berry uh yeah but m[y]- i i guess my feeling on drug testing in the work place i am one hundred percent for it you are um yeah i know and um i[t]- it i a lot of people you know have a problem with the random testing like why should i be tested and that person not be tested but the point is is that nobody sh[ould]- right and that you know it's it's it's illegal i mean maybe if drugs were legal then this would be all different but drugs are illegal and therefore it shouldn't be i[t]- it should be the law that we're able to test for something that is illegal that's for sure um-hum um-hum i agree r[ight]- yes oh i love that commercial i know that one's really powerful but you know it's true um not even the interaction with people like one on one but well i guess this relates to the school bus but people in warehouses that are driving forklifts you know that um the[re]- there could be some serious accidents that's really that's a shame no i don't yeah what is the policy at TI do you have to be drug tested or oh that's where i work i work at Manpower yeah well i i work for Manpower i mean i'm a i supervise the office yeah huh so you were a a temporary working at TI oh neat oh yeah i don't blame you um-hum but you had to be drug tested before you could work the um-hum that's interesting um here you know Kodak is the the big name in Rochester Kodak what is Kodak Ko[dak]- yeah the film right no it's okay but um i mean in Rochester everything is Kodak but you know but half the population here works for Kodak and um usually they set the trends and originally um it was only the people that were working in the industrial type of f[acilities]- facilities that needed to be drug tested because they felt that if they were using drugs they would be the most dangerous versus office type workers who probably i don't know you know what they they never saw what sort of um you know problem they could have if they were using drugs i guess i don't know but um just in nineteen i guess it was nineteen eighty nine they started testing everybody so now anybody whether you want to go in and work in the cafeteria or be yes they can but they can't do it more than once a year i think you you can't be tested more than once a year would they spot test at TI yeah um-hum oh well um-hum that's good well um the thing you know you brought up about Mayor Berry you've probably seen the clip on the news the one where he's um going into that room and and making the deal with somebody did you see that well the you know he got he got acquitted or whatever the term is but th[e]- yeah that he was um the charges were removed that to me is so oh i know and it's so absurd because now kids are going to see that and say oh look he got off the hook i'll get off the hook too you know yeah right oh i know yeah that's true really well i think everybody should i think it should become just a a standard law sure yeah that's true um-hum um-hum program yeah but um i think that your point about schools is um probably the first place to start because they're the ones that are influencing the new generation you know that are going to become the people working in those companies um-hum um-hum yeah um-hum no me either right oh i know it's crazy it makes me so upset to hear about all these movie stars and you know TV stars that have gone through some sort of rehabilitation and because um i guess th[ose]- th[ose]- those people are so glorified you know they're the the the sitcoms on TV that's like perfection and then to find out that um uh Michael J Fox you know went through three years of using cocaine y[ou]- yeah he did i just read an article about that um it it just shatters my whole feeling about him and and then i just think about the kids that glorify him or the you know just idealize him or whoever yeah and they have the money you know they don't have to worry about where they're going to get the money to pay for it yeah unfortunately yeah um-hum um-hum right exactly exactly it takes over i even um i forget if it was 60 Minutes or something where people in jail are even getting drugs i i know and isn't that insane i mean how does that happen it just doesn't make since to me uh God it really is crazy i don't know um-hum oh really what do you mean they get people oh my God yeah are you serious and and it would actually work like they could get away with it um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum right oh gosh that is really scary it's really scary to think that uh some of these guys that were over right that's true but it could just take one that that's in charge of a g[un]- a cannon or a gun or something you know right they can where that is that a prison oh um-hum um-hum i see wow yeah well they need to be pretty	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

all right uh how long have they been recycling there in Virginia yeah um-hum uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh have some problem with the phone huh hello yeah okay you're okay okay uh-huh uh-huh have you have you cycled plas[tic]- recycled plastic also we we have out here uh up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way they had some bends around that we could find and put them in but not all that many it wasn't very well advertised but recently uh the refuse department has has uh is working on getting a system going where we will actually have uh a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things so it it should be good uh i think it's a marvelous idea when you think of uh when i just think of the papers that i dump out i mean there just it's such a i waste i just hate to think about it uh-huh uh-huh uh uh uh-huh yeah uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah all that's neat yeah yeah that's right i guess one of the things i think that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about about it there's needs to be more public uh service of programs or something that would let us know had a happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening and there's i've seen a few things but not very much really and i- i think that's a shame they need to do a little more i'd like to know for instance when i when they say uh plastic all plastic what kind of plastic can you put all together or is there some reason not to uh now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use i don't know but i i'd be glad to organize it if that they'd tell me what it is i'm doing because i think that would that would be really helpful uh oh uh-huh yeah um-hum that's great now that gives you a little bit of incentive there uh-hum saving them for you huh uh-huh i think that's right i think i think helping us be more enthusi[astic]- enthusiastic about it helping us maybe maybe using the money for something special that would be like paying off the national making sure but i- i think that's right i think they there needs to be a little bit more in the area of of uh ad[vertisement]- advertisement and letting public letting you understand more of what it is you're doing why you're doing it how you're it's done and what what happens to it because i think that's that would help a lot yeah yeah i yeah yes i- i i'm glad to see some of these things i think people are becoming more conscious all the time that it's really necessary to do and that we need to somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped and all these things that i think that's true well i think i'm that's about my uh some on recycling but i- i enjoyed talking to you uh-huh all right bye now	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
do you have any pets now Joey the the dog is Joey the cat is oh my goodness oh my i beg your pardon oh well did you all catch it or uh uh-huh no did no did you catch the fish uh-huh and it's all alone in that aquarium well at the present time i have two dogs an English setter you know that's the white dog with the feathers and it has uh yellow spots on it which they call i think uh liver spots and that's a male and i have a wonderful female lab black lab quite a long time uh probably five or six years and unfortunately the black lab that's a female it tha[t]- it's it's the most wonderful animal we've ever had an i- when she was about three years old we noticed that she was having pro[blems]- uh problems limping and so forth and she has hip dysplasia and it's in that breed but now i think there are tests that can be conducted uh to tell whether or not the puppies have the have it but i think i don't know apparently they've been so in well i don't know inbred or what but well no i'm not sure that's the situation but it um for those dogs that are registered and if if you should have one uh that also has hip dysplasia you cannot breed it uh uh-huh but she's wonderful um like ha[ve]- what are the what are the symptoms uh-huh yes um well uh i have had just wonderful luck with this lab uh when i- uh let's see winter before last we would bring her in and uh when it was cold and she wouldn't i you know the next morning you want to take them out and she wouldn't i couldn't get her up without p[icking]- picking her up and which it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds um until if i allowed her to not get up on her own it'd be two o'clock in the afternoon anyway i uh met my son's uh college roommate is a vet and he said um let's give her some race horse shots and you know in i'm i'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this but you because you all the time you know run into people with problems anyway that's when we lived in Oklahoma and uh so he gave this dog a series of it's they give it to race horses uh to get rid of uh cartilage and it's called anyway it's a series of six shots once a week and then i noticed after two shots she was well i could have but i can't give a shot i took her from Enid Oklahoma to Oklahoma City every week for six weeks and uh after the the second shot she was significantly better then i didn't notice any improvement till the after the sixth one and ever since and he said uh a booster uh every year or two i mean maybe every six months or or something like that and when i notice in the winter when it's worse you know it's cold weather and so forth then i have uh gotten a booster for her but not many people in this part of the country know anything about i've had to get it from Oklahoma they've heard about it but they've really never used it so dogs that get down in the hips like i think German Shepherds do it and probably large dogs and uh it's just wonderful uh um well we're living now in an area where we we we're in the woods and we take walks i just don't let them uh uh go away from me but we take walks through the woods twice a day and uh i can over do it on her but anyway at least she can go and she's not limping along and all that tell me about your cat and is um Stripper an inside cat or outside uh-huh yes well of course that's nice they they well he's been well he has been trained and you've kee[p]- you've kept u[p]- it up haven't you yeah it is wonderful i i have some neighbors across the field and um they when we first moved here uh when the dogs and i didn't fee[d]- we have a very nice kennel and everything but but since i i didn't want to i wa[s]- i just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while so i kept watch and never let them get away but now every couple weeks they wou[ld]- one would slip away and my neighbor said to me oh i noticed those dogs dogs are so well trained anytime they hear your voice they come so that made me very proud well have we been talking five minutes i'm not either but yeah well um so it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure yes oh really uh-huh no they don't no i i glanced at the clock when um we started and i think it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something but one day i was talking to a lady about gardening and i'm i love gardening and she did too an and after after about twelve minutes or something the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape but it's been so much fun too uh talk well my best friend in Virginia's daughter is a part of this project in Texas and so she knew that i had the time and would be would enjoy it um so but i have a hard time getting anybody because i guess do you work yeah and probably just got home so um during the day i me[an]- i thi[nk]- and i

i don't think i've ever met anybody that thought they were paying too little taxes so i assume that we're going to agree that we all pay too much taxes but then the question is are we getting what we pay for and and i think we don't i think we pay far too much for bureaucrats and pork barrel projects right well i lived in Texas for a long time so i was really hit hard by the nine percent California tacked on to the government's yeah i know Texas uh just raised their sales tax again because_1 uh i was visiting in Houston over Christmas with my mother and uh uh i w[ent]- bought a few things and i think your sales tax is higher than ours now yeah well i really do believe that there are huge quantities of money wasted on u[nnecessary]- unnecessary uh bureaucracy and on just flat stupid things we h[ave]- we have uh hundreds of thousands of dollars going to uh people to supervise people who supervise people who supervise people and when it all comes out they don't do much supervising anyway well actually as a matter of fact that sort of research i think is worth spending some money on because the uh basic research really is what's made our country uh get to where it is in its ability to compete no well i y[ou]- i don't mind spending on defense for things that work but i mind having pe[ople]- uh uh people spend money to create five thousand pages of documentation to order something this is crazy yeah exactly yeah i think the six hundred dollar toilet seat is probably a legitimate expenditure given what the government requires of the manufacturer the manufacturer's probably not making very much profit on that but th[e]- probably five hundred dollars of that toilet seat is going to uh ridiculous kinds of of paper work and supervision um are are you familiar with the Grace Commission well i don't remember exactly w[hen]- when that started but it was back in the early eighties i think uh Peter Grace of WJ Grace and Company was uh appointed by i believe Reagan to um create a commission to investigate government purchasing and expenditures and see if there wasn't a way to save money and he c[ame]- uh he and his group of course he didn't do it but he got people to do it came up with a a whole book's worth of recommendations for making the government run more like a business and he said that you know the the kinds of things the government does even in renting space would drive a business bankrupt and uh people purchase things because of the rules that require them to buy certain kinds of things in certain ways that are totally irrational they buy more than they need or less than they need or many times as much as they need in little quantities when they ought to be able to um you know deal like a business and uh get things in quantity that will uh y[ou]- give them_1 a discount they ought to pay their bills on time one thing the government does is is stretch out the payments so that they end up paying penalties for things that the government could have paid for the minute it was due and taken the five percent uh credit for early payment anyway there was this whole book that came out and i read some excerpts from it and every single thing they recommended was so a[nd]- and it just astonishes me that we have not put more of that into practice and ev[erytime]- right and everytime the uh Congress changes and people move offices they redecorate the whole office they spend half a million dollars on the Speaker of the House to renovate an office that had been redone less than three years earlier and then they come up with these crazy projects to do things like spend seven hundred thousand dollars to make Lawrence Welk's birth place a shrine i do not need a national park around Lawrence Welk's birth place and i can think of a whole lot better things to do with seven hundred thousand dollars well i don't think it does much good but i write my Congressman all the time i've got a congressman who is very concerned about uh uh irrational expenses and who is a real fiscal conservative and and so one of the things i do is donate money to his campaigns and uh write to him when i see things that outrage me and uh i don't know that it's going to help any but if he got uh if if a lot of Congressmen get that kind of input from their constituents maybe they'll do a little something yeah yeah well i'm in favor of spending money on a strong defense but not of wasting it and some of the things that we do uh like have three different kinds of incompatible computer equipment for the three services it's just dumb there's no reason why we shouldn't have somebody take a look at uh all of the things that the various services use and make them_1 interchangeable then the same spare parts can in uh Air Force planes and Navy planes maybe oh oh yeah um-hum um well that's good but that's that's small comfort because it doesn't bring you any income until you sell it now we don't have uh property taxes going up as much as you all do because we had proposition thirteen that says uh once you have had your house appraised then they can only raise the taxes i believe it's two percent or maybe it's three percent a year uh until you sell and then it's reevaluated uh and that's that helps people on fixed incomes and older people who have houses that have gone up in value a lot but who don't want to move out of them_1 well the prices are so high i don't see how they can keep going up yeah well i'm in Silicon Valley and they uh the the reason that the prices have gone up so high is that there just isn't anymore land left to build on most of the surrounding land is all uh in preserves of one sort or other and it can't be developed so there's very little property that hasn't already been built on and one of the problems our city is having is that uh with all of the environmental requirements and the {antidevelopment} people taking over the city council we've driven out some corporations which were paying a lot of our taxes and so now they're going to have to assess us because they we've driven out the businesses that were paying the freight yeah for instance we have the Stamford Shopping Center which was uh paying oh i think it was about a quarter of our uh city budget because of the sales taxes that were collected there and in this recession a lot of those businesses have had poorer receipts and so their sales taxes have dropped and we're about a million dollars below budget primarily because of the sales tax drop off and that uh and also Hewlett Packard was uh h[eadquartered]- headquartered here and so everything that they sold the sales taxes uh were pai[d]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay Pat can you tell me uh wha[t]- actually they want what everyday occurrences are right or do you have yeah that's a point um actually um uh using credit cards the information that the person that you give it to has of uh available to them is very limited that's to just your name i guess um you don't have to tell where you live you don't have to put your phone number down some people uh ask you for it but you're not required to give that information oh very very few up here yeah yeah they just don't they don't ask for a driver's license um yeah see my yeah my checks are it's just my wife and my name no address so it's just names on the check so no one can you know i mean they can i suppose with a little leg work if they wanted to but the average person's not going to do that anyhow okay um oh okay that's yeah i i've read articles about that but people have to be pretty gullible um either that or or especially widows um old people right and and some people some of the older people today uh their husband's handled all the finances so now they find themselves left out in the cold and they're really really not savvy as far as it comes to fi[nances]- to handling their own personal affairs yeah i'm i'm still not convinced that they can get you if you're if you're aware first of all you never should give your your uh credit card numbers over the phone to anyone which is which is kind of basic um they people may generate lists are if you subscribe to a magazine i guess they sell lists of names to other people but they'll send you junk mail usually um and you can stop that easy enough just go to the post office and just have your name taken off uh yes i have no they did not right yeah but that's uh isn't doesn't corporate have a didn't they put a stop on that yeah right yes they do exist and if someone wants to really find out about you i suppose if they wanted to go to all that trouble they could uh yeah right yeah you could do that if you really wanted to yeah right yeah yeah yeah that's and you can do that anyone can do anything that's public record whether it's divorce or anything like that um whether you purchase a home that's all that's all public record um what they do with that information people are really um go out and do it i suppose somebody does the leg work and they and they generate a list um uh it's uh i think lists are generated from lists now and right yeah we had uh we've got a an account at Sears Roebuck and we had moved from one town to another town and they've got our address listed now with with double towns in it and i've tried and tried and tried to get it off but you just can't get it so since then we've gotten solicitations from other people listing both towns so i know damn well that Sears has sold their list of names out to somebody else but there isn't anything you can do about that right some of the some of the charities now will will do that if you chose choose not to have you[r]- your name put on a list and i- i do that you know we have our charities that we give to and then we say yes no just don't because you do it and then you're on everybody's charity list that's right that's exactly right uh most of the funds that a lot of these organizations collect go to fund the organization i mean very very little of the funds get out to do uh anything worthwhile um it all started with the government the government started keeping tabs on you and whether they those list that Internal Revenue has whether they leak out to the public or not i'm really not sure maybe in some cases they have in the past uh once a list is out it's out forever yeah but the bulk of it probably ninety seven to ninety eight percent of all those lists are going just for solicitations um some people maybe are using them for ulterior motives i'm not really sure but the bulk of them_1 is and it's junk mail and you can you can you can get off those junk mail lists you just tell the post office so that will limit that amount of stuff i read uh i read and article where this this man uh se[nt]- sent to everything they could possibly get and he was getting reams and reams of paper all kinds of periodicals and magazines and letters and notifications and what he was doing with them he was storing them up and he was using them for fuel during the winter time what i do is on all the credit card solicitations if they have a return envelope with it i write across the face of it no thank you your rates are too high and i mail it back to them_1 because now they have to pay the postage so now it's costing them something to do that they don't oh up here they do well they're still doing it well it's just like up here we don't there's very very few times i've had to show my driver's license for to use a credit card uh and i'm not sure why you know why it's so prevalent down there and maybe it will catch up up here yeah we've got the we've got the ones you just stick your card in the pump yeah so whatever you whatever brand that you buy you just drive up to the pump you put your credit card in it and then it says you know please commence pumping and then when you pump then when you're through you put the nozzle back and it says do you want a receipt and if you can push yes if you want one and if you don't want one you push no	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

uh no uh no my father was uh came in right after world war two i am too young yeah um yes a couple uh the the one guy i worked with down in Austin hated it uh he was a lineman down there and while he was there he caught some kind of a strange disease and uh all his hair fell out and he had like a hundred and five fever for a while and i do not think he was in combat so um-hum um-hum yeah right yeah but he was in the Navy though he was it makes a lot of difference um-hum oh yeah well the armed forces did so much to you know Agent Orange they did so much to their own people all during that time you know and they ta[ke]- they take a even now uh they take a free hand as far as medicine and uh you know how they treat the war casualties you know if you come back and your leg's blown off you know or or it is hanging by a thread they still can't put it back together now but but what they do afterwards and how they re[habilitate]- rehabilitate you um-hum yeah oh yeah it's a[bout]- it's about nine or ten percent now um-hum um-hum yeah um-hum yeah that's um-hum well they are probably not doing very well at all because_1 i know there's there's still people even in the Dallas area there are there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from uh Vietnam um uh na[tive]- native Vietnamese people yeah they were lost you know when they were little and and they c[ould]- never did get back or yeah and uh and uh that's is really a big waste because they didn't they didn't win they didn't regain any of the land that they had it spilled over into uh now i can't even think of the country but yeah Cambodia and to Laos and and all they did is run and hide and they weren't really fighting you know it it would've been the same as Desert Storm if all they had been fighting was North Vietnam but and i am not even sure who was involved more whether it was China or Russia you know they were pouring they were pouring weapons in there and and advising well digging tunnels for them_1 you know and there is no way that they could ever catch them_1 yeah that is right um-hum yeah yeah and all they can do is dig in and they you know and then they try to camouflage the top well now even i think even now in in Vietnam they could probably have done a better job because they could they could kill all those plants you know which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on but and the and the Corps of Engineers i think do a better job now like they did in Desert Storm because they had he he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil and he set a lot of booby traps all along the way as they went and they had to you know they had to blow them up or or disarm them_1 and then they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he where he'd made those moats uh we[ll]- yeah partially uh-huh yeah part of it is technology yeah because all go ahead yeah i think that's one of the reasons that they've they've pretty much avoided getting involved in South America because look what happened when they were looking for Noriega and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him you know he probably just went down into a tunnel yeah that is right um-hum yeah and they they really need everybody that's that's stood there it's when i[n]- in Vietnam i think it was much closer contact you stand there with a rifle and blow a a piece of somebody apart or blow their head off and that has to affect you if you are human you know so they had to work all that that anger out and the and the nightmares that come along with it i don't i do not really think that anybody can ever for[get]- forget that but they can they can reason and and try to adjust to to why they were there right um-hum right yeah and that and that was that was in the in the era when Kennedy was president that they were afraid of everything you know and and and they f[ought]- initially got into it because of Eisenhower and he just he didn't want to be in it any more than than what we started out in August with Desert Storm and then it just blew up into the war French yeah um-hum right um-hum yeah right exactly um-hum yeah more than was apocalypse now yeah i think so yes it was nice talking to you okay bye-bye	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

hi my last uh auto repair was my my uh alternator went out i have a nineteen eighty six Toyota uh it's a little Tercel and uh i have a fr[iend]- a friend whose real good with uh repairing cars so i got him to take the alternator off and take it and uh you know get a replacement part we went to a uh a a place called Quality Auto Parts an and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and and everything and they're they're uh very reasonable so uh i bought the alternator we p[ut]- put it on the car and it it didn't work and it blew out all the fuses yeah uh i be[lieve]- something like sixty nine dollars some[thing]- something on that order no he hooked it up right it it was just that the the part just just didn't fit the car so i took it back and uh he he took the alter[nator]- the guy in in the parts shop took the alternator and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them and uh he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator so we we went back and tried it again put it on again and it still didn't work and we took the car up to um a little place called Pep Boys i don't know if you have them in your area but uh they're they're pretty reasonable uh car repair place also so uh took it up there towed it up there because it you know wouldn't start or anything and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and uh took them about an an hour to um figure out what was what was blowing the fuse and it was it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse anyway ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer and the only problem was that uh it had to be a genuine Toyota uh alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it that that you know they sit in there and everything but there's just some little difference that um causes it not to work ye[ah]- yeah i guess so and that was my that was my last experience uh-huh uh-huh goodness are you able uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah uh-huh well my car is uh it's an eighty six and i really hadn't had any any trouble with it un[til]- until that and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it and uh and this was just recent so i really can't complain about this one um well i used i used to work uh it was a seventy mile trip everyday you know two ways was seventy miles no it was it was just seventy miles yeah and uh i did that for about three years and it really it really added up i've only taken uh maybe two trips that were about four hours long dow[n]- uh down to Shreveport and uh the rest of it was you know it's just basically driving a long ways to work and now i drive like twenty twenty three miles each way so i'm getting a little a little uh little relief but still i drive a long ways but i guess because they're highway miles you know it's not so bad on your car as as if it you know were just regular street you know yes i do do you points uh there's a number that you call it's the same number that you that you call to make a call you you call that number and and uh somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message and you can leave a message i know someone that did that you leave a message and they'll they'll call you back oh really uh-huh well i don't know if i've done it quite that much but uh mine is mixed up too i have to call and get it fixed um uh let's see before i had this car i had a um um i bought an Audi five thousand but i bought it i bought it used i i just bought it from a friend who was going to who just charged me what the dealer was going to give give him for it for a trade-in and uh it had a whole lot of miles on it i i figured maybe i'd get one or two years out of it an i an i did get a couple of good years out of it and the uh the engine messed up on me and then i gave it to a guy to repair who works for the aut[omotive]- for the Audi dealer and uh he took the engine apart and you know he just said he couldn't fix it so the engine never got put back together again i wow i think those old cars might might be a pretty good bet because i don't know i- uh-huh um uh-huh i read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy four uh-huh yeah yeah it's easy to it's easy i guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars engines and transmissions and if you i guess if you keep trad[ing]- changing them out you can keep a car for a long time course i guess i could do the same thing with the the Toyota that i have i just don't know how much they'll charge me to yeah i guess so but i just think they cost too much in the in the first place now a days	0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay no i don't but i have nine younger brothers and sisters um-hum uh-huh i would assume it's you know if you were looking for a day care center or something like that or probably even babysitters would be the same thing yes i would think someone older and i would want to know if they've had any past experience with children um-hum yes that's true also uh-huh um-hum well um i did a lot of babysitting when i was younger i'm twenty two now and i did most of my babysitting when i was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen but um the only thing people ever asked me well of course they knew i came from a family with younger kids but they really didn't ask me if i was used to children or not the only other thing they asked me is what i would expect in pay you know and um i was pretty surprised because if i had a child and someone w[ould]- you know i would want to know i personally would ask for people that that person has babysit for before um-hum um-hum yes well see when um i first got my bab[ysitting]- my first babysitting job was pretty strange um this lady saw us at church and she was a y[ou]- you know she was a younger lady she didn't really know my mom she knew my mom by name and that was it and um she knew that i was one of the oldest girls in my family so she just asked my mom if i could babysit you know she really didn't know my name or anything you know and i thought that was pretty strange you know and she had two children one was still in diapers when i started babysitting so um she pretty much you know just assumed that i would know you know how to handle them so i wa[nt]- you know i enjoy kids and i get along with them very well so there's no problem but uh with today's world and the kids today uh there's no way i say that i would just ask someone you know that i didn't know like that to babysit um-hum that's true um-hum oh i would be too oh my huh-uh um-hum yes uh-huh oh i know um well i real[ly]- i obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything uh-huh uh-huh um-hum well how did you stumble upon the day care center did you just look it up in a phone book or what was it um-hum yeah most i would say most people would probably go by word of mouth uh-huh yes exactly um-hum um-hum then again did um money come into play with it at all uh-huh uh-huh yes	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
hello i'm Nola and i'm in Plano yeah no did you push one oh okay okay well th[en]- i think it i just started doing this so i don't know too much about it oh okay uh-huh that'll be fine hi yeah yeah yeah well i i i think overall that's right i think it's kind of sad though that for generations they've been taught to hate each other and that's i[f]- you know if somewhere in there someone's going to have to learn a different way you know a[nd]- an i i think that um true we do have completely different ways of looking at things at a lot of things but uh at the same time i think there are a lot of there is a lot of good that the United States and other countries can do as far as example and and um i think some different things could come from what's happened than what we expect yeah yeah yeah but that's the type of thing they understand they don't understand any other way and so at that at that you have to work at their level to an extent too uh they wouldn't have understood anything else than what we did in the war there was nothing else yeah yeah i can't figure out why they him yes yeah yeah hum yeah um-hum what's sad is that the leaders that have control are i[n]- power yes and they abuse that which i think that that's not the the way the majority of the people over there really are but i think in a in a way the war uh i think in a way all uh the involvement over there too though has shown a lot of people that there are a lot of people that don't follow what those few are doing and there are a lot of people who are good people you know there's and i i think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these uh newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the the uh soldiers leaving um you know surrendering and trying to get out of that situation and and the um uh you know that's right and i i think so much of it is what you're taught you know they teach their children uh in such a way that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well i have a really great one that i make in the summertime because it's cool and it's uh it's just really pretty easy it's pretty much dumping things in and stirring and i like that uh the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in in it and then i you're supposed to do chicken but i just use those little cans of chicken and it makes it so much easier and so you dump the rice you dump the chicken and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off but i get my kids to do that so i- i don't have to do that and um and it really and you mix it all up with ye[ah]- there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up but it's so simple and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime uh-huh yeah it has to sit in the fridge over night but but it's really good and i like that one yeah exactly uh-huh oh that sounds good yeah yeah and these days that helps doesn't it yeah i know what you mean now spaghetti's such an easy one um i do that a lot i do spaghetti a lot yeah i don't like to do that if if it's ho[t]- real hot though because um i don't know i have a real thing about being hot in the in the i guess yeah yeah i think that's right and um we don't entertain that often but when we do i'm like you i like it to be fast and easy and something so that we can talk and not and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time yeah yeah that's exactly like us from our church we just do it yeah oh well you see all that on TV and i could never be that person it just uh i'm just not well i'm so i'm pretty laid back and uh and so i don't i know a lady in a my church and uh she like does her own bread and does her own stuff and so when she um does food she really goes all out and i don't know how she can do it and be calm i guess no i don't uh-hum yeah oh how exciting yeah well i usually start about six and an and cook and and then eat at seven i mean coo[k]- cook at five and eat at six rather yeah and uh my family and i we're a sit down together family uh yeah i don't like the run in and out part and i like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an[d]- and my husband about what's happened and i think i that was ingrained in me during my family time at home and uh you know we could learn to talk about things and i think that's good yeah i think yeah yeah well that happens to us sometimes too uh sometimes if something uh is on that they want to watch i leave it on but we eat in the kitchen and their heads are always poking past the door yeah anyway food is is uh a real lifestyle kind of thing and i some people don't like to do this but i like to coo[k]- uh cook with my kids and if they're going to have other kids over then then they help and we make real simple things you know those oh i don't i don't know if you've ever made them maybe not since you don't have kids yet but those JELL-O uh gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers i can't think of what they call it yeah they're so simple and the kids love to do that uh finger food is is a biggie with them and and like now one thing i wish i could find a a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks because they love to do that and it's just really hard and if they have to work with a knife i don't like that so that's uh they like to eat it but it's a hard one to have to to prepare but they like that with the the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that so yeah yeah my son's getting to be a a real good cook so uh sometimes he fixes me breakfast yeah i like it i like it a lot he's eleven uh-huh yeah so he's uh not every morning uh mostly during the summer it's hit and miss and we usually have like uh cold cereal or something like that um during the su[mmer]- during wintertime when they're in school um then i try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a twice a week or something and then have like when it's really cold i even cook oatmeal because i like oatmeal and the loo[k]- they like it all right and um then sometimes we do something it has to be fast because they're on their way to school we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that but yeah so i try to uh and sometimes we do eggs if i get up early enough to do that i used to do them in the microwave but they don't like that uh um it de[pends]- it depends if you let them cook too long then they'll turn a little bit gray you can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray and they will be a little harder and i don't like that so you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in if you have a microwave book but uh you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a like a plate over the top and let it steam and then and then stir it up yeah an and that turns out okay and it's funny because_1 if i turn them out on to a di[sh]- i- on to like a plate for them to take what they want they don't know i've ever done it in a microwave it's really funny it's very deceiving you know because_1 if they see it with their eyes they go uh i don't like want that you know and yet if they don't ever see it th[en]- then it's like oh this tastes okay you know so anyway yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay so i do a little bit more than i think usual people do because i am here alone during the day and i like it just for the noise um um it just depends on what it is i mean i have my favorite things that i do and that's a fun thing to do sometimes but um what about you right well see that's great yeah well right well i think that well part i think that's partially true i think you have to have the will and the and the um anyway i think it you you could be susceptible to stuff and it has to be reinforced at another level too but anyway what would you watch if you had you know this week to watch i mean do you like specials oh oh oh right yeah well we have cable also and and sometimes you can um get the uh HBO specials and sometimes those are really pretty hysterical so i- i like to watch comedy i mean you know that's something but i'm not real up to date on what's going on now i- i guess i have my old favorites that i hooked into i mean you know like Bob Newhart still on on one channel and uh you know something on that level i- i also enjoy um i don't know its Sunday morning it's channel thirteen i watch a lot of thirteen uh The McLaughlin Group and i- i just laugh i mean i think it's so hysterical these guys it's just so much fun it's just it's just a lot of fun watching that i mean i don't agree with a whole lot of stuff they say but it's fun you know so yeah i watch to be entertained i really do oh now that was fabulous and that you know yeah yeah yeah i know so you know well there's certain thin[gs]- i mean i've got um my TV in the kitchen here and um you know if there's something like cooking shows i love to watch cooking shows i- i really do i know i- i yeah and and there's some um in fact one of the watercolor shows on now has inspired me to take watercolor lessons you know so you know things like that y[ou]- you get a wh[ole]- whole lot of exposure yeah yeah oh uh-huh she thought she was yeah oh well see that's y[ou]- y[ou]- y[ou]- but she was probably depressed to begin with you know what i mean yeah grumpy to begin with yeah i hate that show yeah i- i good isn't that amazing how old are your kids oh okay so that's yeah i had forgotten about that see it's just my husband and i and so i don't have that you know i uh that constant influence of the kids shows and all that but um i don't know yeah right and and you know they get it at school too anyway so you might as well not reinforce it i i know i remember going to sch[ool]- my parents were a lot like that too and of course we did not have any of the variety you know kids have but all the kids used to watch Rawhide and all those shows and my parents never let me watch anything like that i could watch Yogi Bear you know what kind of culture was that and i remember going to school the next day and everybody would be asking oh did you see that did you see how he did that and did you see and i could never participate and it always made me feel a little bit you know like a loner like i you know but um but see then my parents i think then you have to replace it with other things you know to uh really yeah that's true or you go rent a video up at the store and come home and sit down and watch it you know well that's you know that's something people don't do that well here we are talking on that subject but that's that's an interesting concept i've got to stick in my um you know work with kids on but um	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh our children are both uh basically adults they we've we've got two uh one's twenty one and one's twenty five and they they still live at home well that's that's a little unusual for uh for children of that age to have both of them_1 that age at home but uh i guess the activities that uh we have with them are uh pretty few and far between actually the they're both going on their own most of the time so uh most of our activities are you know just discussion type things about what's going on in the family and what they're doing and that kind of thing uh-huh sure it does uh-huh oh yeah i yeah yeah is the one year old a boy a girl ours is the older one's a girl so and the and the younger one's a boy so um i guess uh what i see is so far as uh the trends uh uh for children uh i don't know what kind of a area Virginia Beach is but course uh Richardson's in the Dallas area and uh i think uh the big city uh activities for for children now are they're good but there's so much uh potential danger you know that you really have to watch your children so closely now that y[ou]- you can't let them_1 grow up the way the way i grew up you know that i i'm from a smaller town in East Texas and i could you know go and do whatever pretty much whatever i wanted to do uh my whole life uh you know i never never had to worry about the bad guys being out there and uh you know i find that it's quite a bit different now that uh you know you have to watch your children so closely and uh keep up with them_1 i- i feel like uh that it's it's really a sad commentary on uh you know on life in general that uh you know that children can't cannot be allowed to grow up uh you know without really close supervision um-hum um-hum right yeah yeah um i guess looking at uh back at at what our children did compared to what uh you know what i had to go through in school the uh there i[s]- there does seem to be a lot more in the curriculum it's a lot more complicated a lot more available of course but uh there s[eems]- seem to be a so much more to learn now that it it really makes it more difficult i would think i w[ould]- i would probably have a hard time getting through school myself uh you know i just or at least it'd be a lot harder than it was when i went to school uh-huh right yeah hm yeah i think uh oh right yeah yeah yeah that uh uh watching the little little boys play soccer is uh is more fun i can't imagine that them having as much fun as the parents had watching them_1 right yeah di[sorganized]- d[isorganized]- disorganized play that's uh r[eally]- really what it was but but uh yeah when ours was a he i guess he was probably five or six you know when he first started playing soccer and uh and it was it was more fun to watch those boys trying t[o]- trying to kick the ball up and down the field but uh and it i guess that was uh you know it was important uh as much important to the parents as it was to the children that uh you know to get out and watch the kids play so i guess one of the things that i think about is a y[ou]- talking about education uh i kind of feel like uh that uh the the school systems in uh particularly in this area the systems are not under enough control the the students have a little too much uh too much leeway excuse me um a[nd]- an[d]- an[d]- and that's kind of contradictory to what i said but you know y[ou]- th[e]- ha[ve]- you have to be under control so much when they're out but when they're in school they they don't have quite quite as much control over them_1 as uh as what i would like to have seen uh uh uh i kind of feel like there's there's too much allowed to go on in at at school and uh you know it tends to uh to encourage students to not be as you know to not concentrate as much on education you know they're they're there for a good time and you know to to see how little they can get by with uh right but uh yeah but uh i- i- i don't know i think uh you know some of the thing has to do with uh with the civil rights program not that the civil rights program's bad but that there's it carried over into you know individual rights and it you know trickled ou[t]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

how do you feel about uh drug testing Bob okay um how do you feel about people that are subjected to having to have the drug testing done um-hum oh uh what recourse do you think a company would have then if they had people using drugs and were jeopardizing the company structure protection um you mean uh uh the test to oh the polygraph um-hum um-hum um-hum correct um-hum do you um-hum um-hum um-hum right i guess uh they feel because drug use is so widespread and there's not any um deviation so to speak between an executive and a lay person as far as drug use goes and um i feel and just looking at it on the surface um that they wouldn't have much of a choice um in picking somebody uh sometimes drugs don't uh the results of taking drugs don't come out until after something tragic has happened and in order to uh resolve it before it happens that they feel that this is mo[st]- the most direct way and painless way of uh scanning their uh employees i know that in our company i have not known a woman to have the drug test yet but of course the men i guess it's more pop[ular]- and i don't know if this is true if it's more popular between men drug use than it is women because i know there are a lot of women that do use drugs but um-hum um-hum as there are men uh-huh i don't know anybody uh in even a random um friendship that uses drugs um-hum um-hum a casual user of drugs or uh-huh just to try and see what it was like and then yeah that were experiencing different things um-hum sure um-hum um-hum well i- i would be um i don't have any desire to but i would be awfully fearful because of all the uh um illicit drugs that are around and the methods by which they're made and some of them are very deadly and it's kind of playing Russian Roulette with drugs so it um-hum well it doesn't bring anything but chaos um-hum um-hum do you think a rule against a certain uh um substance is in violation of their civil rights um-hum i wonder if uh now in their applications when they hire people i know it wasn't in the application that i filled out years ago but if now they um are very up front with saying we are going to test you for drugs and if it's then knowledgeable to the uh applicant um-hum um-hum so they know that it's not a right um-hum we live in a in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay so tell me about China Cry um-hum i see um-hum right uh-huh um-hum uh-huh um-hum hm huh huh huh um-hum oh um-hum huh interesting story i uh i don't even remember seeing that advertised and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly oh that recent oh i see what you mean um-hum well uh i guess what i what i saw most recently and luckily i saw it only a week ago so i'd remember remember it well was um sort of light by comparison uh my husband and i had this great desire to go see a comedy and and uh we ended up going to see Green Card Green Card and and uh he chose it and uh it's got this wonderful French actor who's it was his like his and he's been a star in France and a wonderful actor who we've enjoyed for years but he's never made an American film this was his American film debut and he speaks very broken English and basically he played um a Frenchman who married an American girl uh in a marriage of convenience so that he could get his green card which is what an alien needs to work in this country and uh because she could claim she was married she could get uh an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in New York that had a garden an an an outside garden which is very unusual there because she was a horticulturist and that was sort of her dream of course you know they got married and they never saw each other again except except fate threw them together and the Immigration and national Naturalization Service um started investigating so they had to get back together and get their stories straight and and she was a very s[ophisticated]- well sophisticated urban New Yorker and he was a poor Frenchman who had grown up on the on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was he'd been working in a restaurant when they met and uh they had to learn all about each other basically in a in a weekend and uh it was you knew what was going to happen of course that they would fall in love well they fell into like at any rate and and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever uh they did perfectly and then he said something because his English was so poor on for the most part he he was so proud of himself for giving ex[amples]- all the correct answers that that on the last one he said oh i never remember that answer and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers so um	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay um do you own a PC by the way i'm guessing you probably do oh i see right uh-huh uh-huh and what kinds of things do you use it for when when you u[se]- when you go to their hou[ses]- houses to uh use them yeah oh uh-huh um-hum great yeah oh sure yeah uh-huh um-hum yeah well i tell you once you get used to having them you you get spoiled really quickly um huh uh-huh yeah right yeah yeah um i kn[ow]- i'm a a writer by profession and uh when when i was first here in in Dallas or in Plano um and was finally able to this is oh been like fourteen years ago we moved here and i was finally able to afford a new typewriter and i got an IBM Selectric i thought i had died and gone to heaven because i thought oh they're so wonderful well then um yeah ours really needs to have some work done on it but but then my husband um worked at TI and i got a um this has been years ago he doesn't work there anymore but he got a um um the the TI Professional and brought that home and i learned WordStar on that and boy once that happened there was just no way that i could ever go back to doing anything of length on a typewriter uh-huh yeah have you ever used do you use WordPerfect ever have you ever used WordPerfect or uh-huh right yeah yeah that's probably where you've used it uh-huh yeah um i have that on my uh computer here and also um i w[ork]- do some work at UTD and um that's what they have there and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and and already know the lan[guage]- you know already know the the software and um i don't know from my own experience um WordPerfect just just so much better than than WordStar at least the version of WordStar that i used to have it may be improved by now but yeah it's uh WordStar was never very intuitive to me i mean you know you some of the commands just had nothing to do with w[hat]- you know what you were supposed to be doing what they what they did on the com[puter]- computer but uh i mean like going um forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just you know didn't match with the kinds of keys you were using yeah and but WordPerfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways and you and it does a lot of things too that if you if you do any kind of uh research or anything like that where you have to uh use footnotes it is just wonderful because_1 it keeps track of all your footnotes and if you add it if you put a footnote in in the middle you know if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it you just change um it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you so you know it's just yeah yeah and i think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper and retype everything and uh it was just awful so um i don't know i think we have just become really spoiled but i think it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled so um well i have not really paid much attention to a clock although i think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes so um if you um unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with PCs well um i was a technical writer for many years um and my husband and i actually met in a computer company um i was a tech writer and he was an engineer and uh so i did tech writing for a number of years oh sure um oh oh trying to figure out what all that was about huh but um i have um that that was the majority of my writing although um i have also done oh freelance magazine writing and some educational writing and um for a while i had a um uh a partnership with a in an advertising agency with another woman who is a an artist so i did some advertising and PR but um now i'm ac[tually]- actually i'm i'm not working anymore i'm a student i'm a graduate student so i'm doing a lot of writing but uh now all of the sch[olastic]- scholastic nature so i've done a little a lots of different kinds but i- i just know right now that i couldn't have put out half of what i did if that much without the being in computers so that's been really great and uh i'm so i'm real spoiled yeah uh-huh yeah good that's great yeah well those are skills that she certainly w[ill]- is going to need early on and you know the and it seems like it's getting earlier and earlier with the children so um i think that that would be a real a real uh advantage to to her to have that and uh do it early so uh do y[ou]- do oh neat yes right oh great right that's great well that's a that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life so might as well start now huh well Nola i have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly this is really going to be fun i think and um my husband is a ham radio operator and i think about all the people that he talks to all over the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

what was one of the latest ones that you've seen actually uh right the last two years i have done more theater movie going than i have actually watched videos at home i've uh uh become available to come and go more often so i said hey it's worth it i'll just go at the matinee hour and i can see what i please no it's no more costly than renting one the last i- see i went about uh two three weeks ago and saw FX Two and that is a really good movie if you like special effects kind of gory and lots of you know action um do you know that i don't follow performers i don't follow actors some i know some i don't um and he was the guy the guy that played in it he wasn't the star but the one that played in it that i liked best was the one who was in uh oh the one about the old people the Cocoon uh-huh he was a blonde haired heavyset alien in Cocoon i don't i don't know what his name is yeah at any rate i also saw not long ago Once Around that was with Richard Dreyfuss and that one was just a very poignant story it it it had people it was it was you know a lot of people said it was a really funny movie but it was a very it was a poignant humor and there was it was like uh uh Steel Magnolias the characters played very well off one another and there was humor involved but the story was a very dramatic story and i enjoyed it very much what are some others that you have seen lately oh whoa yeah that's one i can watch over and over and over again it sure was and you know the second time you see it you understand more subtleties in it there are a number of good movies like that um-hum um-hum yeah um-hum right you don't work okay_1 well you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him call in sick one day that's right there's nothing wrong with that go in the early hours it's a matinee it's not crowded and the the uh price is as reasonable as renting a video and that's the way i do it and i go quite frequently if you are going to be planning on doing that now i saw Warlock too which is supposed to be the story of a of a witch hunt that is you know magically shot into the present time and the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was i was very well persuaded to walk out very well persua[ded]- there was more gore than i was interested in seeing but then the movie settled down to a comfortable action uh i can't really say that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either but uh the action was comfortable and of course i enjoyed those good guy bad guy type conflicts things so i enjoyed that movie after the first few minutes of gore and there were some others but they were done a little more tastefully but uh in the first scene the Warlock chopped off a guy's finger because_1 he wanted the ring and then bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet and i could not handle that i said whoa i'm glad i have not had dinner then uh i saw Awakening that's a wonderful wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De Niro uh Robert De Niro what did i say Peter i said Robert De Niro and he has done a really good job of characterizing the uh disabled person and of course Robin Williams always just has a an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing even when he's sad you know you have great faith that he will get happy again and then oh let's see there's a couple or three that i would like to go see before they go into videos i guess i can wait another month and they will be videos one is Silence of the Lambs i've heard a lot about that one they say if you really want to be uh you really want some suspense that's the one to see and i understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television uh um-hum and then uh Thelma and Louise i think it's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie it's about time for one of those i want to go see that and i'm going to try to get in Dances With Wolves um-hum i've heard it's wonderful too but i it's just that they are both very long uh movies and the matinee starts before i get can get away from work and after after that i get involved in other things and don't want to don't want to go back uh-huh you know i saw that and i i cannot remember too much about it uh-huh uh-huh oh that's right i remember now yeah i remember um-hum um-hum well i've had a hard time enjoying Harrison Ford in anything since the Indiana Jones movies i think he ought to i realize that he'd like his career to develop but i don't want to see him but uh i tell you Sean Connery in the Hunt For Red October i- i never did care for him as in the James Bond movies i don't know he was too i yeah i didn't care for the type of movie but he was always slick and greasy and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed and didn't like him but he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older i thought oh yeah yeah he does and there is just a there's a i don't know uh i think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning whether he is or not and he he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time and uh i enjoy those and i enj[oy]- i even enjoy some of the Michael J Fox movies i didn't care too much for the last one either it just was not enough to it uh no no no it was called uh Hard Way where he was an actor trying to portray trying to a policeman and uh that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

hi Ed hi oh who wrote that huh i see well that is int[eresting]- all right that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that and they haven't made a movie of the week of it yet yeah uh explained like supposedly scooped up by the triangle yeah yeah on that same topic have you ever read anything about you know the Amelia Earhart story whatever happened with her i- i think that would be i am sure there is something out there uh that might be a i thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years well whatever this is one aspect of it of course you know it is so weird cause no one will ever really know it's it the so but it's entertaining and it makes you think about things that is for sure yeah right well i- i just i guess haven't read anyth[ing]- i mean usually i just if i find a good book i will sit you know for two days until it is finished if it's that good and i think the last one i read like that was Scott Thurow's and that was Presumed Innocent and i just really really liked the way he writes it's just incredible yeah uh that was good i think and and the other book i am trying to think you know like was in the last year and i think i did read Tom Wolfe and uh Vanity you know Bon yeah and yeah i that was really really good the movie was nothing compared to the book and yeah oh the movie was a joke compared to i mean because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive when it comes to you know pinpointing um so[ciety's]- so[ciety's]- soc[iety's]- society's ills and things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things and and uh so it was it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the and anyway we are not talking about that but um gee i just i like to read gardening books and things like that just to me what to do with my garden and and uh yeah like what is a book on your list you know i have a list too and i have never gotten to it oh	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay do you like to listen to music well i'm not either as far as Bach and Beethoven and all well it's really strange i like country music and my husband likes the older rock and roll stuff so we've had to kind of educate each other that's been kind of strange yeah but being in from Te[xas]- from Austin you'd think you get a lot of good country music oh oh yeah that's true well have you ever gone to Austin City Limits uh-huh oh you have did you like that oh yeah yeah i took that in college one time as an easy course yeah oh really well naturally i- i like George Strait and uh and Garth Brooks went to the same college that i went to and he used to play in a little dive there in town when when he was a nobody no i don't know him personally but i do remember going to see him when he was a nobody yeah but i went to see George Strait when George Strait was a nobody too so yeah i've kind of followed them well i really like um what's his name Jackson what's his first name i can't think of his first name he's a blonde guy and he sings um Alan Jackson yeah he has some kind of fun country tunes but you know it's really funny because country music has changed so much from when like i remember in driver's ed in high school that that my teacher always liked to listen to country music as we were driving and i thought oh God this stuff is horrible it really has i mean country music is a lot easier for people to break into as opposed to other fields of music so i think a lot of people start out in country and then try to yeah yeah definitely yeah i used to go see them they weren't nobodies then but i did go see them before they got to be major big stars so it was fun but oh yeah yeah i remember because_1 when i was taking driver's ed is right when You Picked a Fine Time to Leave Me Lucille came out and it seemed like every other song on the radio was that song yeah but it's fun i really i- i enjoy listening to it i- i keep my radio on at the office but i don't you know i don't have it turned up real loud unless it's a really good song yeah just a little see it's real funny because the guy that i work with is from um New Jersey and he is trying to learn now about country music he's gotten to where he really likes it but he doesn't know any of the names of the people or yeah just yeah i was so amazed yeah but he's got he's real funny because his office is across from mine and so he'll turn up the radio real loud and say who's this singing i work for a computer company yeah it's it's fun because it's small enough that we can do stuff like that and get away with it so uh-huh oh really oh wow yeah uh-huh yeah oh really oh yeah yeah well did you happen to see her um welcome home show on the HBO for the troops she had so much energy i mean she danced and danced and danced and i thought golly that's like a two hour aerobic class yeah that would be neat i didn't know she was going to be in Austin wow huh well that's neat yeah well are you familiar with Don Henley at all he um used to play with The Eagles have you do you know anything about them okay well he was one of the original Eagles and he's broken off now and gone solo and he was in Dallas Saturday night and put on a wonderful concert he sang for like three hours and he sang a lot of old stuff and a lot of his new stuff so it was really exciting yeah i'm sure your daughters do yeah well i in fact i had older singers so or older older singers older sisters so i got to li[sten]- i got to listen to Herman's Hermits and all that stuff so that was fun and it's but it's really funny now because i'll i'm going to be thirty in August and it's sad because i listen to the oldies' station and i know all the songs it's kind of i know oh really yeah well i hope it's really funny though because i'll be at the club working out and i'll hear the aerobics music going and i'll think God that's a remake of an old song i know remember the original oh i know it's pretty sad but it's real funny with my husband too because he really likes older rock and roll so yeah he i mean he's got Beatles and Crosby Still and Nash and you know all those songs that that my sisters know i mean my sisters listen to Beatles but not any of the other ones i mean like he likes Santana and some kind of off the wall ones so i'm getting indoctrinated to a new a new uh line of music yeah it's fun though we have a good time because_1	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well Steve did you go to college oh that's good so you probably could give some great advice uh-huh well what's your ca[reer]- what's your interest your uh uh-huh that that's similar to what i'm in a PhD program right now and uh my area of expertise it's information systems which is a little bit less technical i think than uh than computer science but my area of expertise is uh uh human computer interaction and i think that's one reason why i'm part of this study uh because it's of i'm working with voice systems yeah so so good luck i guess we should talk about giving advice though wh[at]- what wh[at]- what type of advice do you think you'd give to a a parent yeah um-hum yeah uh-huh yeah i think that's more important probably than even the career vocation because most people change i kn[ow]- i know very few people that uh started in one field and stayed with it you know they i think that's what you just said you know having to do more with the size of the school the environment of the school uh i think that's much more important i- i think i'd i'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school though that has a number of different types of programs you know that uh some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer but some of the uh small some of the larger small schools you know i guess around three or four thousand students have a can offer a broader range of curriculums and things so if the kid does change they don't have to transfer or they don't have to uh uh i don't know they don't have to give up years of you know of credit transfer and things yeah i- i normally and and parents hate to hear this you know because i- i actually teach college i- i hate to uh i hate to talk to the parents because um one of the reasons is because you know the kid doesn't know exactly what they want and i always say make sure you major in something that you like even if it's not going to be your career vocation because you'll get better grades i- i think most employers would probably rather hire you know a a three six in um in history uh to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration that make sense yeah i always you know tell them_1 that you should major in something you you're going to get good grades in because that that's always i think more important you know overall i don't know yeah oh you you're at the office now you are at work yeah i would i would it would i- i tell you i live in Maryland and the public schools here are pretty good i teach at a public school actually and i know that the SAT scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the public sch[ool]- a lot of the private schools and um i actually i would full time at a at a public school and then right now i'm teaching part time at a private school at a Catholic institution and um and i really think i i think i'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school because i think their parents pay more and i think the kids are a little bit more challenged because their parents are probably college educated where at the public school i don't think as many parents are public are are college educated and i don't i think because it costs less the kid doesn't take it quite as serious you know they're not it it's the minimal cost but i think you can get a good education at public or private uh but i think you can also get a bad education at public or private you know i you have to really you have to look around at the school i- i think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for um-hum right uh-huh um-hum right right yeah does it have a big ten football team or is it yeah i mean uh yeah is it a PAC ten school you know but i think yeah see i'm i'm at the University of Maryland so in this this region um though i go to a smaller branch of the University of Maryland my diploma will still say University of Maryland um you know it doesn't doesn't differentiate on my diploma though i would put it on my resume what program i went to but i- i think you know i'm actually at a smaller program i'm not at the coll[ege]- the big College Park campus you know that's the big one with the football team so i- i think um i think you're right that there's a lot of there's difficult decisions there based on name recognition um you know when i first was applying for graduate schools i applied to some big programs you know in this area like Stevens Institute of Technology which is recognized in the Northeast as as you know one step below MIT in a since you know so it's got big name recognition in this area a big science school no football team but a big science school and technical people know that but i don't yeah i think you're right you really have to think about that for the job i went to a very small state college when i got my bachelor's and when i now i was in education at first when i was looking for jobs i was going to be a teacher i was just a high school teacher so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of you know but then when i went um for graduate work you know or for a new job people said to me you know Shippensburg State where is that you and you know when i went into higher education even at other universities they weren't aware of it you know so i think yeah that's important um i think it depends on if you want to be a if you want a regional job or a national job you need that first job or so out of school too um-hum yeah right um-hum right yeah depending on your technical areas yeah i could see that but you know at some of the large schools i know that at at at University of Maryland where i am you know in a PhD program i- i haven't even met uh someone outside of my area of

okay well this is a very timely topic in as much as we're going to a family reunion this weekend yes down at Lake Texoma lodge yes this is one that's uh the Baker family reunion and this has been going on at least uh i would say at least twenty five years or thirty something like that maybe longer than that i'm going to get back into the fifties sometime first time i got i married into the family and the first time i went was about fifty seven i think but uh this one has been uh well organized and in fact it used to be at Lake Brownwood and now it's Lake Texoma because that's more central location for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to very important because uh you'll start losing people if it's too far to go yeah yeah at both places right listen they've uh they've had this one well it just of course over the years it has uh built up as far as the organization is concerned but now they uh have a golf tournament on the Saturday and then they have generally a show or an auction or something on Saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such yeah and uh everyone uh they get the community building there at Lake Texoma lodge and everyone brings in food and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in like Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant and uh it really uh has worked out uh generally uh i think it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people i think normal is about sixty or seventy oh oh yeah right yeah well our family start[ed]- reunion started out my wife and i were the kids the newlyweds so to speak and now we go our children go and our grandchildren are going now so it's uh wound up that uh we're the old folks now but um they have various organized they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes uh to pitch and they organize a baseball game for the kids and then several people bring boats and there's a place they they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon so it it's a full day some of the people come down on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend and some just come in for Saturday so it uh has worked out quite well and it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see all year long except that once a year yeah my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia and i think we've been to one in thirty five or something like that so that's just too far away yeah it's an all day drive just to get to this area yeah yeah yeah we have uh each year of course they elect officers of the family reunion and a number of years ago back in the early eighties my wife was president we discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together and it takes a lot of planning and assembling of stuff right that's correct so yes it is i- i- i don't really care for her to be president again but that is uh it's it's a lot of work but it's a lot of fun we've enjoyed it and the grandkids really enjoy it because it's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from Oklahoma yeah and this year they're all excited the the show this weekend this weekend is going to be a rock and roll show my two grandsons and one of their cousins are are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song you know in jeans and T-shirts and such so it's uh it's going to be exciting for them and for us too oh yes they've been some really wild shows put on there they uh really get uh into it yeah well oh that generally happens yeah well we've uh had various things over the years uh to raise funds for it and again it's not it's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the m[eeting]- meeting room down in the cabins and such but uh they've come up with they've tried passing the hat and they've had auctions and various things to raise funds and uh some people do and some people don't excuse me but um anyway that's the family reunion story okay been nice talking with you bye	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

yes we're doing several different things um and i haven't kept up to date on what's happened lately but they have uh the igloos around and they have various places for different kinds of recycling um-hum and uh uh i understand in the future we're supposed to uh begin a curbside pick up as well but that hasn't started yet how about you curbside would be wonderful i'm ready um they're also doing um a a recyclable bags to put the grass clippings in uh-huh so that th[ey]- you can't put them in plastic anymore and uh so that seems to be helping a little bit too oh that'd be great h[ow]- i am i'm not sure how a mulching mower works -[d]oes it just chop it up finely or what and you don't see the clippings lying around then huh well now do you recycle plastic also uh-huh i've heard that that's um something that can be started oh is that right right ooh that's a good idea oh that's great well no you've got to do that uh um-hum oh how funny well old habits die hard don't they i mean it the whole issue of conservation and everything is i you know i i talk about it all the time with my kids i'm a teacher and i we talk about it a lot and yet um there are often times i find myself doing uh y[ou]- you know throw[ing]- going ahead and throwing a way a plastic bottle instead of you know separating it and so forth i and i just forget so it's a it's a effort on everybody's part i think to begin to do this and keep it up oh oh good that's right that's right and my kids help a lot my son um uh tried to or helped build a a little recycling center for us here at the house you know put to put the cans in and uh papers and uh plastic and so forth so we have a little place that he built out in the garage and uh so until we get curbside service we cart it all over every once in a while but they're real good about it um they're real responsible much better than i am really about um sorting things out so um so they've done a real good job oh good idea oh that's great and you can put it back in your copy machine and just run it on through can't you yeah uh-huh i bet huh well we just need to do more and more right more people doing that yeah um-hum is that right huh i've never heard of that either interesting interesting well and that the other issue is disposable diapers um and i i guess some companies are beginning to do some things uh to where part of the diaper can be recycled or degraded um but we did an interesting thing in my classroom um calculating the number of uh diapers that were used for my class of kids just in the time that they would have been the age to wear diapers and uh the kids were just astounded and then we calculated a[ccording]- according to the number of kids in the school and that kind of thing and so that you know that's a real eye-opening um activity to do because you you begin to think of the and and billions of diapers that are there oh it's that's incredible um-hum that's right yeah oh and y[ou]- you know i with my first i was all gung ho well we're going to do cloth and everything and then part way through i i just	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah exactly oh d[id]- d[id]- did you do the diagnosis o[r]- or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed uh-huh uh-huh yeah i know uh when working with the uh flashers there is uh usually a a special fuse that operates the flashers do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam diagram yeah i don't even know if my uh current cars have a separate fuse i know sometimes when you think there are uh things running uh while they're at the same unit like the li[ttle]- the headlamp you tend to think well there's one fuse operating the whole thing but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam uh requires uh the use of a of a maybe a higher fuse so that's a possibility is this a a mail order parts house that specializes in in parts for uh old imports wh[o]- um so it's not J C Whitney or somebody like that yeah have you found any uh uh reliable import service people in the metroplex oh yeah uh-huh i'll be uh-huh oh my goodness oh no well ours wasn't within the last year i guess it's been within the last two years uh Judy has an Oldsmobile that we bought new and it's one with the uh electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer and uh i don't know what else it all controls but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort and we found that the uh uh we were having two problems it was idling fast when you first started the engine to the point that uh we park on a on a hill under our car port and when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley and knowing that you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard otherwise it would just wrench control away from you and the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would uh be driving along uh decelerating like coming to a stop sign but not yet stopped at the stop sign and the engine would just quit so we took it back to the uh Oldsmobile place and asked them to check it out and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing so they adjusted timing and the problem didn't go away so we ended up taking it back again i don't know why they don't look at these things the first time around but the second time around they looked at their uh recall service and their uh service reports from region or headquarters whatever and and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error in the uh computer control unit which fortunately they replaced under warranty because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part and uh so once they replaced it then the the car seemed to work fine for a a considerable period of time and now it seems to be we don['t]- we're not experiencing the stalling but we're still experiencing a very uneven	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well not so much personally but my um husband has a aunt who has been like a second mother i mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such they live down in College Station where his parents do too and they put her in a home last year she appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to uh not be able to be in her apartment on her own so they found a a place nearby that they put her in last year uh yeah although she is uh in pretty good health and she's doesn't take any medication it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point then she was starting to get uh you know lose memory sometimes and which is kind of frightening when she's in the car uh well yeah when it finally came down to it um she just got to the point after the i mean it wasn't a very um strong stroke it was just kind of all of a sudden she wasn't quite herself anymore and she got kind of fearful of being on her own she never really ate very well it was one thing she hardly ever took care of herself and she didn't eat she ate very poor so i think she was you know bad uh nutrition on top of it and uh she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore so um well she was almost ridiculous like she'd eat ice cream and cookies she'd didn't one oh really well she didn't want to cook for herself anymore oh that's too much trouble that's too much trouble didn't want to cook yeah although they've got uh Meals On Wheels which i understand is a really good you know way to handle that so that at least they eat no i don't think there was um i know a little bit more from a a coworker her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in um she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care uh then she got uh uh hip broken and then uh she wasn't as ambulatory so they were almost you know to the point of saying she can't be here anymore but i remember from her checking around she ended up staying at the Arkansas House i think out in Arlington something like that and uh you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh a uh bathroom all of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items they they're always saying that somebody's going to and some of them i think unconsciously do it you know as a just you know half seni[le]- hum so they they uh don't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items very limited space waste but um at least they all seem to have some you know people that monitor their uh medication intake and dining facilities you know go to the dining room and and eat some good meals i know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in i mean very antisocial maybe it takes a while for them to say okay well i'll be with other people but yeah i don't understand that they they don't want to be with anybody else uh-huh uh-huh yeah i have a um my aunt's mother is uh gotten ill recently and uh she lives in Pennsylvania they live in Alabama and they're saying hey we need you to be closer and you have uh women like that i don't know to men it seems like the women out just out live their husbands but very reluctantly that whole i mean they don't get out of the house they don't socialize but it's my home and i don't want to leave it um um but it's it's so lonely you know they can't get out and see anyone and i mean it's hard for for someone like me to understand that because i th[ink]- i think what do you have there it's a house it's walls and it's furniture but there's nobody there don't you want to be close to me i mean you know be with other people i just don't understand why they so much want to just stay in that building and there's no family there they don't get to see their grandkids they don't get to see their children they just there in that house yeah that's from the child's standpoint the child is going why don't you want to be close to me and your other family what does that house got attraction i never really thought of independence uh well when she got home who took care of her ah um-hum um yeah my husband and i we have been thinking about his folks are in College Station and we've pretty much planned that we'll be here in the Dallas area and there's nothing to hold them there in College Station since they're retired so we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

oh yes i'm an old experienced hand i started back when it wasn't stylish to do that at all my daughter that's seventeen now i worked even when she was a baby and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two and then i was really lucky to have put them in a Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist right off of Walnut Hill and Preston and it was a wonderful environment i i just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place so it worked well how about you uh-huh uh-huh yeah uh-huh it's not hard to find anything that's part-time so many of the churches have really strong preschool and children's day out but it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little and this is one of the few churches that did it there were a couple downtown Dallas but they were so seemed cold and impersonal i just couldn't hack it and what i liked about Preston Hollow is that the people that were there when Cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today so there was real continuity she went back as a teenager and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there so it it was really neat but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love and she just kept good people and real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts and i'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff uh-huh or pay for it after school our Emily's in the third grade over at Huffman and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art and you know i willingly did it but i thought this makes me angry this is something that ought to be in the schools rather than some of the other stuff they do yeah well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the the day schools do serve those purposes yeah yeah put the colors away which is too bad uh-huh uh-huh until they were two yeah yeah both times they were at our house and that was hard too i i lucked out with really good people both times but i know so many people that are never able to find that and i'd practically give my paycheck away to do it so ye[ah]- yeah well no she didn't live with us uh the first one was an elderly lady who was putting a a daughter through nursing school just purely on babysitting money and she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more babysitting at night and she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead so that that was a plus from that respect as well and then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her so i just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center um-hum um-hum yeah oh that would be hard well they give a lot more leave i work at NCNB now and our benefits for maternal and and parental care and even for elderly people or are really expanding we have more options now then we did when i my kids were born with being able to take off full-time longer of you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time for up to six months it's really neat i've i've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week or they've you know whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint we try to work it with their hours and that helps because you don't have to just w[ean]- wean yourself cold turkey and say okay i never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals i've of course it's too late for me so i've i've not tried them to see how effective they are but i think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast and for our age group it's too late too little too late but i i do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work two income families i think are here to stay uh-huh right yeah oh sure you retain employees and keep them longer that's that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that w[ell]- they want us to be happy and want us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces so i i hope it helps it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full-time because that's hard uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh well in Plano though the problem is you find and this is what i found with Emily i from the time she started first grade i wanted her out in Plano area and i kept finding neighbors and friends and they'd move she ended up being in a different home every year and i finally decided i didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move so this year i i tried KinderCare and then she's old enough to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

the AIDS issue is is a bit of a problem i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is is the financial end i mean how can a country stand to uh spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem uh but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor i'm not really sure if it's true or not that uh we're not spending as much per let's say afflicted person on cancer uh there's some uh take breast cancer for instance it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more peo[ple]- mean more people than AIDS and yet uh more people die of it and yet the funding is already uh exceeded AIDS has more money than uh breast cancer so uh i mean if it's true i i've i've always heard these things i've never bothered to dig it out and make sure but uh i've heard it on more than one documentary that uh they were complaining that whoever's sitting up there making these decisions uh or whatever institutions raise the money and uh it's just one big PR campaign that yeah we think that's the world's worst thing so let's give money to AIDS and yet we've had breast cancer problems for years and it's just one of those well of course one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesn't effect men it's not gonna get funded and uh having thought about that for a while well i i kind of i thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing but then i go[t]- i got to thinking the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and there's only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood an[tigen]- antigen uh antibody test for the antigen in the blood and that's fairly recent and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years so it's not really cure f[or]- yeah it's not uh not that heavily funded either and that seems to be one of the the major uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer so i don't know i i guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to um be it through different organizations March of Dimes type uh telethons or or bicycle rides or whatever how they fund whatever um illness they wish i[t's]- it's kind of hard to to get an even keel on that i mean it's really hard to say well there's you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one so let's give it this amount and then this other one's only a tenth of that so give it a tenth of that and and just keep doling it out that way or right right that's true you know the the other thought that i had um i've had several minutes to think about this after i uh while i was finding people i uh i could think about the topic longer than the person that receives it so it's kind of a a unfair advantage as they were but the other thing that i've thought of on this is i wonder if there isn't enough money uh in our economy or in our system uh it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good i mean yeah they're kind of nice but we have such an affluent -[s]ociety society that i wonder if if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a uh cure for just about everything of course then we wouldn't have any room to put people but yeah you know you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza or you hear these these phenomenal amount of dollars spent for this that or the other and then you have all the arts that that are nice and aesthetic but are they that enhancing for the m[asses]- for the masses you know they certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that but uh had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else	0

okay what kind of fishing do you do uh-huh that's one of the few things i've ever fished for is rainbow trout what what kind of bait do you use to catch them_1 oh really fish eggs oh i didn't know that huh uh-huh oh i didn't know that's a great way i think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish also oh look catfish uh personally i like to catch large mouth bass and catfish because they fight the best but a a catfish will really just tear into anything like that like liver or uh cheese or anything that smells terrible um no actually i always used to go to my grandparents' in Oklahoma and they have the uh Lake Texoma right next to them_1 so the we used to catch some uh sand bass off Lake let's s[ee]- there's a Roosevelt Bridge and what we'd do is let the line all the way to the bottom and crank up you know turns on the reel about six to twelve times and the fish would be sitting at different levels so yeah you just leave it at that level and in no time something would hit it and you could pull them_1 up two and three times in a row but you had to find out what level how many cranks they were off the bottom and if you left it on the bottom there was a good chance that you'd catch catfish and of course depending on how big your bait was um you know would be depending on what you caught yeah that was a lot of fun my grandfather used to do that and we used to have a light at the top of the water he really me in that respect um-hum uh-huh yeah well if you do you have any friends with ponds i um well if you can fi[nd]- well oh even a lake if uh seems like every time somebody's on the bank all they wanna do is throw it out just as far as they can and uh bring it in to you but it's the opposite when you're fishing from a boat you you wanna le[t]- make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm and just have it come into the water like a a regular animal or or fish uh well you know something coming off from the bank like they usually do so you don't have to really get uh fish from a boat you know because they're actually right there at the shore but i didn't used to be sold on plastic worms but uh if i am yeah it just uh just a slow reel and then let it sit on the bottom but the key is to always have your line tight and that way you can feel when they're hitting it and believe me you'll know the difference oh crappie actually i've been fishing in the the ocean we're about three hours from the ocean and i also like Spanish mackerel and you can catch blues and uh that's a different kind of fishing off the pier too have you ever fished off the pier uh-huh oh the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits and and jigs um they have like yellow um fuzz on a hook you know that kind of comes out yeah yeah get but they're a little heavier and they're bigger get the yellow ones those are the ticket and let them_1 drop to the bottom and maybe do a a kind of a slow reel you don't even have to have a good rod or anything just just even a regular line and you throw it out and uh the the other thing that's real good is small um it's a real small repala it's about an inch and a half long and they're pure sil[ver]- all silver something real shiny about that long they'll go after that in a heartbeat also just anything that really shines or spins oh yeah yeah that's it oh really that's neat oh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
okay how's the weather been in Plano r[ight]- yeah this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city uh well i don't know about you but i was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks and i'm ready for it to come back well not the rain so much as the cool the other mornings when it was like sixty five when we woke up and sixty six and today and i when i got up the the temperature said more like of course seventy nine or eighty so i'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather you don't are you a summer person are you well i have a friend who's the same way and anything below sixty she's just not happy but i- i think what i would miss is the change of seasons and all because i know in Plano we really don't have as many seasons as the my husband's from Nebraska and they have more of the four seasons oh you're used to that too you don't like the cold well i usually like it about sweater weather and the problem here in Plano is it doesn't last very long it goes from hot and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer and then it's cold and i wish it were several months of that well i don't either unless it's like uh some of our favorite's like a Friday night when it rains and you really didn't have anywhere to go and it's sleeping time but if you have to get up and get out in it no oh yeah well sure it does that kind of schedule you really need a lot more sunshine and also the evenings are going to be getting uh darker sooner because as it gets cooler but i did a walk last night and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler well i agree absolutely and you know it's all relative because i was from west Texas and it was very dry and so i thought Dallas was awful and i still think so but then this summer we went to Orlando for a week and it was so humid there that your um all your windows were were wet every morning they had to get the squeegees and clean them off and when we got back to Dallas it seemed really because_1 it's kind of like what you're used to but i agree with you the humidity especially for curly heads like me yes i do not like the um-hum yeah i think so too i know our grass needs mowing twice as often it but it seems like here i would like it to rain and then be over and then not rain for a while it seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern that's all it does so uh but i- i am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like i guess my my best would be probably sixty eight when you wake up or sixty six and then probably seventy five during the day yeah yeah are you do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds yeah so yeah just keep it there yeah well i do too i do too and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it but then we started thinking especially in Plano the weather is so hot in August that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow static here yeah we do too i think a lot of people agree the same uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh now there have been worse summers in fact this morning when they were talking about uh Harold Taft they were talking about how this has been one of the milder of the summers and milder fall everybody seems to be you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat because_1 they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're just and then you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings and we'll it'll be too cold and they'll say well those are the ones that like the cold weather oh yeah he did he did it was it was really a shame he didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them_1 did it's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five oh is that right okay oh good well good well then have a good day and i hope you enjoy the weather this week	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

uh what i[s]- what is your practice as far as budgeting do you manage the money oh i see that's how kind i am too are you married you are i think the women for the most part end up managing the money my husband always says he earns it and i have to spend only what he earns it well i don't work outside of the home and he always threatens that when i spend more than what's coming in i have to go back to work so i- i no do you actually follow a budget well that's pretty much the way we do um or we did in the past i would say what right at this point our children are grown and so i really don't have the obligations there anymore that we have to balance to get things together for them and i really just keep very good records and most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that and i try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently uh i don't always succeed at that i usually keep one with a low interest rate and i'd put things on there that i think i'm not and then i have another one but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point we're in a new home and uh they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to so i'm still getting used to that but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead and we do not buy use[d]- ah new cars uh do you get into the car we do for us very much so in fact we are in a position that most of our friends why wonder why we just don't go to a new car you know whatever and i said look you guys are all into car payments we haven't had car payments for so many years i love it this way and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked and it has eighty two thousand miles on it and we were kept saying boy wouldn't it be great if we could find another one just like it believe it or not we did we found one one newer the worst part is it's the same color and so everybody's saying you're kidding you have two cars the and i said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again i said well we had one and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it and it's an eighty five and so i said hey this was a cinch we've paid for the car and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on this is for all the long running back and forth on you know interstate driving and things and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years or next year probably generally from dealers and uh it depends because i don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual uh unless we we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell you know uh we were going up to a larger one but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer and we always make a deal i mean we have walked out of more dealerships saying don't bring us the manager and all of that unless you wanna bring him right away you're gonna get one shot at us we will and they say well you're kidding you know i no this is the price we're going to give you out the door we don't wanna hear about taxes	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
do you have any pets holy Nellie i oh i guess we have one miniature Dachshund oh i don't think i could cope with that many how d[o]- how do you uh avoid having your house smell um-hum um do you let your rabbit run around loose okay i- i knew somebody who said they were easy to uh litter box train but she had trouble with it chewing on wood oh how what kind of a dog do you have um-hum uh do they get along see we our dog hates every other animal and our we have a couple children that are are grown and on their own and every once in a while they will come home for a visit with an animal and our our dog just about has a stroke well um-hum well we we kind of joke that that our our dog's about eight years old and but one son was between jobs for a couple of weeks and was here with a Golden Retriever and uh when he left you know we swear the our dog's muzzle turned white and then uh our our other son is in the Navy and was being relocated to go to school down at College Station so he was here for a couple days in between waiting for his household goods and stuff and with a beagle puppy and we swear after she left the dog got gray on the front i don't know but it a a a visit from uh one of his cousins uh tends to uh r[eally]- really affect well i think they're i think they're good company i have been trying for years to convince my mother who lives alone that she would like a a dog she loves it when she comes here and our dog sits on her lap you know and she'll just sit there and pet him and pet him and i'll say you need an animal he would and yes um-hum well and i- i think they're good for kids in that they can teach the kids responsibility you know if if you if you have a a kid who wants an animal badly enough and agrees to take care of it i mean it's a responsibility cleaning up after it and um you feeding it making sure it has water and uh you know just just all that kind of stuff that's that's good also uh but we just have a we we in the past we've had Great Danes which were probably the best pets we've ever had y[eah]- oh they were well the first one we had was wonderful she just finally died of old age but she was just so the the greatest house pet and uh we were asked when she was probably about ten years old when our our youngest one was born and she would totally ignore this baby i mean the dog could be laying there sleeping and somebody could carry this child into the room and the dog would just kind of sniff and wa[lk]- walk out of the room and would have absolutely nothing to do with the baby until uh she got old enough to sit in the high chair and throw food over yet and then all of a sudden the dog decided she was okay but but then my husband decided it wou[ld]- might be nice to have a lap dog for a change now he just really likes having a dog that curls up in his lap when he watches TV and sits in his recliner and falls asleep uh what wh[at]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and i'm up in Wisconsin uh my name is Terry and uh in the small town we don't but uh we're not that far from the city where there's tons of pollu[tion]- okay i'll go ahead and start recording that okay um just in particular here in the Twin Cities we have a lot of big corporations and um i'm sure there's a lot of pollution we uh before moving to Wisconsin lived across from where they were um gravel pits and also where they were making tar and so we would occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar and it would uh smell the continuous you knew that you were also breathing that into your lungs so and it was like miles away but just the idea of having that come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that but also um where we also lived too it was very close to a highway so we got a lot of fumes from uh trucks and cars and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture i mean it was on your tables you would dust every day and it was dirty um type of uh dust i mean it wasn't the typical dust that you get way out in the country um i live in a small um town now quite a ways from the Twin Cities about an hour away and i may dust once a week and that's all it needs versus every day when i lived in the city so oh yeah it it comes right on through through the screens the only way that you could actually live in the in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house and so it was quite a dirty city um i[f]- if you were well protected by trees which catch a lot of the pollution then you're fine but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises you have lots of other things that are not catching the pollution and it's just going for miles and miles and miles and it's landing somewhere with the wind but sure sure yes yes uh-huh uh-huh oh sure sure yeah it's i mean our air quality um in the Twin Cities is a lot better than what we've heard about California and maybe in the other areas but um they were always talking about the air quality of today is this you know the ozone or whatever and it's kind of scary because th[e]- air is something we take for granted and many people are too busy getting to work not thinking about okay i could have carpooled with a friend even my husband was uh talking to some of the guys at work now he's uh fifteen miles away from work but he was talking wouldn't it be nice to carpool and the guy says well it's too close it wouldn't pay and so yeah and ex[actly]- exactly and so my husband says well that's fine you know it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and you know the gas and no everybody has their preference to drive by themselves or if they do they they drive with one little buddy uh at least it's with one person but most of the time people are saying forget it i don't want to carpool it's too much of a hassle it's too much involvement but yet yes we are and i think of my daughter and i'm sure you think of your children and you kind of say to yourself what kind of future will they have when they think back and say well my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference and i think people are trying but they have to change attitudes um-hum sure um-hum sure sure well they	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
sure i have a Springer Spaniel and her name is Thumper she's about seven or eight years old i got her for Christmas from my family and uh back when we lived in Nebraska i like to hunt and uh so i thought that if i had a good hunting dog like Thumper that boy i could just go out and get all kinds of game yeah except we live in Plano Texas now so do you have a pet now oh what kind of cat is it uh-huh being born outside you didn't have any problems house training them that's good sure and older well we went to a uh cat show at the Plano Center here in town and uh we thought that we have a cat now but we thought well if we ever get another cat you know we'd want something kind of unique so we kind of looked around and they had everything from hairless cats to Siamese cats and Persian cats and we sort of fell in love with the uh Maine Coon cats they're huge oh i'll be darned i didn't know that we[ll]- that's interesting we kind of like well my family didn't necessarily like like them as much as i did but the Manx is that the one that doesn't have a tail it sort of has a bob tail i kind of like that too but well i'll tell you an interesting story about how i got my dog and then i suppose our five minutes will be up huh i uh work for a university and i went to uh Omaha Nebraska to recruit students and i had some time off in the afternoon so i went to a a pet shop and i saw these little Springer Spaniels and so i decided well you know this would really be a nice dog to have so when i got back home to Carney Nebraska i told my wife about it and i said you know this is just a i- i can just hear the dog crying for me now and and Christmas is coming up you know hint hint and so i had to go back the next week as well as a bunch of other people from the university and one of the people uh that we went with uh they were friends of ours and so we uh got to Omaha and i decided i'd take my friend over and show him the dog and so i got over there and she said oh that's too bad the dog has already been sold and i didn't realize it but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog and she was in the back room and uh so that night we had a reception for some of the uh potential high school students or college students and and uh he had the dog the whole time in his room and and i had no idea and so we headed back to Carney that night and the dog rode in the car and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat and they left the dog in the car and i guess while we were inside eating Thumper just tore the heck out of the inside of the car and uh finally we made it back to uh to Carney and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh how do you feel about this topic right right i understand completely you know i- i feel the same way you know i- i believe in drug testing you know there's nothing wrong with that because something like that if you work in some some types of some type of situations that makes it um makes you unmanageable or something like that that you could either hurt yourself or somebody else uh i might really agree with it you know if they tell you before you come into employment like when you're going to get hired you know i don't see anything wrong with them telling you that you might have to go through one and and then sometimes i have a hard time understanding the random you know the i'll pick you out and i'll pick you out and i'll pick you out and you go through the drug test what's that now uh-huh uh-huh yeah that's true that's true were they right and who's to say if it's for sure uh-huh yeah where i yeah where i was hired they made us sign something saying that we could be um put through one at any time and we were like okay but we did have to sign that but um right right or air traffic controllers right or even somebody on a line you know that could run machinery or something like that yeah that's how i feel too i don't know have you been in Dallas a long time or about twelve years i just moved here and then South Dakota is very seldom that you see a drug test but uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh because i was really surprised because i- i go into my major is in accounting and i've looked at an accounting positions and definitely a a position i've applied for has either come up or you know they won't make you go through one which was a real surprise what's that no to get a position i just moved here in June and uh from South Dakota and i was real you know shocked to here how many that did you know from where i'm from it's not that popular or that much i think yes yeah you know like Dallas has got more people than the whole state of South Dakota yes that's very true and um you know i guess i never was awakened to it you know i knew it was out there but i knew you know i didn't know it was to a an extent and uh i'm glad it's there you know but um it was just something that i come across that i wasn't really you know used to but you know i- i feel fine with it you know that's not a problem and uh uh-huh can hi[gh]- can a high school do that can a high school do that uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah i've never heard of a high school asking a student to do that i guess huh that is that in Dallas or that's in Dallas yeah uh-huh oh really huh oh you do teach oh really um my brother is the Admissions Director at UTD the Admissions Director for UTD so i kind of know something about Richardson but yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
okay as far as uh universal health care um i guess i'm all for it i think it's time that we start looking at um getting into that um health cost has continued to rise and i think uh there's people that to me it's the fundamental uh l[ife]- life of a person um i[t]- it doesn't matter if you have money or no mo[ney]- or all the money in the world um you would everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits um i think if uh they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and uh individuals um helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how but uh the expenses right now for health care um are just unreal yes um-hum oh sure and your constantly exactly yeah the only i- i know that um uh i know a little bit about the uh European uh universal health care and there's some pros and cons one of the things of course is everybody gets health care but uh sometimes health care uh when you get into a universal system lacks in uh what would be considered uh how can i say it um over like in Poland uh where my father-in-law lived for years their their health care system is um because no financial gains are available for doctors uh they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason but most people that go in to being a physician here in the US do it for financial gain they say well jeez if i get into this area of dermatology i don't have to do this i can do this and i can you know yeah or plastic surgery or uh if i become a uh heart specialist i'm gonna make this kind of money uh and there's you know financial gains toward that and in a universal system i don't think there is a financial gain for the doctors the quality i think goes down um-hum when you have a universal system um the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check um and also offering some kind of because i think uh all physicians well anybody um likes the a[bility]- ability to kind of uh get themselves financially uh situated uh i guess that's the whole US concept is to come here and yeah and i don't know if you can have that with a universal system maybe you know there's a way of working that out but i know that in Poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that's it that's what they look at it as there's no uh and that's sad because if that's the case i[f]- if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway but that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind so but i- i think we have to head toward that way uh-huh i'm worried when i get older you know and uh let's say for instance you uh get fired or or not fired but maybe laid off from your job you no longer have insurance i mean and you're sixty some or uh fifty some years old you try try to find insurance i mean y[ou're]- you're uninsurable unless you want to pay five hundred six hundred dollars a month and i know people that are paying two hundred three hundred dollars a month for insurance and how they can do it i have no idea um i know working for small corporations and health insurance um myself um it would cost for a family and this was back three four years ago to put my entire family up and this was working for like a {medcenter} uh health plan um it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck so see yeah well we do the same i mean it's i think uh people are changing their viewpoints of you know it's getting harder and harder to survive and uh and that's why uh if they don't go to a universal system something's going to happen we're gonna have uh uh larger amount of people dying	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well i found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in America and then went back and said well if there is a problem what should we do about it do you feel there's a problem with immigration in America okay that's interesting i was i was wondering what your response would be i'm a first generation American so i'm from immigrant parents or an immigrant mother anyway uh Poland and that was you know prior to World War Two but it's interesting that you know with the topic i think i agree with you there needs to be more of an open policy and you know we have to remember the Chinese came here and were our labor you know for the railroad Transatlantic Railroad and our Irish came and you know built the towns and did labor but what do you think are you from Texas or Pennsylvania okay well that'll be interesting because_1 we have just had a naturalization act where the Mexicans that were residents in Texas i'm from Texas and have become citizens now what do you think about that well i agree with it wholeheartedly the only thing is i've got to share with you and my background is from New Jersey so when you were giving your answer i was thinking is this a Texan i'm talking to because_1 Texan philosophy is a little different um-hum yeah well we oh well then you have first in the experience on immigration well that is interesting yeah w[ell]- i well i wonder you know even with those that were involved with Tiananmen Square you know did we really protect them yeah that is true that is true well what do you think about we have in Texas a large Vietnamese population that has been brought in what do you think about that and these are not the brightest i mean we we're talking boat people we have a lot of boat people in Texas you're a true liberal heart-to-heart good for you i was ready for a fight on this one no i agree because_1 um interesting my when my daughter was in high school one of the custodians was Vietnamese and with his limited English they found out thr[ough]- you know tha[t]- she was in student council and they found out that he was a medical doctor	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this is an eas[y]- easy subject i- i guess i watch too much TV that's do you afternoon shows mainly then yeah my kids love to watch cartoons and i have to come in the other bedroom to watch Jeopardy and such what are some of your favorite sitcoms or whatever at night yeah pretty good um-hum um-hum you don't have a real favorite or they're your favorites huh they're pretty good oh it surprises me that yours aren't the same as mine and i thought i formed mine kind of with my husband we've been MacGyver fans forever a[nd]- i don't know if you ever watch that it's on Monday nights and we we enjoy it mainly because it i think it has it's full of adventure stuff like that yeah and we used to like Cosby real well but it it's kind of slacked off a little bit it's not one of our Murphy Brown i[s]- always is good for several laughs we watch Doogie quite often too but the last couple we wondered if the kids should watch with and tonight's or tomorrow night's sound pretty so but uh we we watch and LA Law is another one we probably watch if we can and Quantum Leap we have our our favorites of course i don't know what channel they're all on probably different ones that's kind of fun to watch too are you watching the World Series right now too or i have a brother that lives in Minnesota so th[is]- kind of been fun to watch and they tried to get get tickets and man the scalpers that were out wanted a hundred and fifty per ticket s[o]- i just read in today's paper where the Dynasty sequel um out rated the World Series that really surprised me i didn't think i didn't care to watch that Dynasty i guess it depends on if you're a Dynasty fan or not it will be interesting to see how many keep with it see if it was really that good but yeah yeah they look like that's pretty good oh well i think i'll stick with the World Series let them fight it out i do[n't]- no i- i watched Dallas at f[irst]- when it first came on and then i lost interest in it too and Dynasty i just never did get into but well i think that's all we need to discuss we have a few similar not too many and now i'll have to watch one of yours and see if i like it all right it was good talking to you bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
got to discuss movies you seen a movie recently Mark i've heard that was real good and enjoyed it huh who's the star but it was good is it it's not a comedy is it oh i know uh yeah i know the movie you're talking about yeah that guy and his wife star in it Brannigan or something yeah yeah where they were married years before or something yeah yeah i know what you're talking about Kenneth Braun oh really i didn't know the story but i knew it got a good review uh-huh uh-huh i bet that was interesting sounds interesting well i had the i- i read the most reviews don't see too many movies we rent a few on we don't go to them_1 but i do enjoy a good movie i guess the most recent one i can think of that i saw was uh on the T[V]- on the you know rental was Home Again did you see that Home Alone i mean did y[ou]- well it's been a little longer than that since i saw it but it was the first time i seen it and i thought boy about three fourths boy i thought what a i can't believe this movie is so highly rated until about the last ten fifteen to twenty thirty minutes of it then it then i was just rolling in the floor it was just hilarious but i was really bored with it for so long that would made the movie yeah it really is it was just hilarious but i did enjoy that well what else have you seen lately i never have seen any of those they must be good i like some of those kind of movies was this one pretty good it wasn't uh-huh oh really i can't believe it was so short uh-huh uh-huh and it truly is supposed to be the last of that series isn't it maybe it's a good thing they bury it huh oh really so he's moving on uh-huh of horror film well well it's been well that but if you you know if it's probably made him a extremely rich man too if it's successful i guess just keep with it go to a different different territory seem that's sure done wonders for old Stephen King hasn't it writing all those horror yeah isn't that crazy i don't think he did do you that and he's too successful and and too too warped sure yeah and they say oh that's mine he stole they're trying to get some money that's all basically all they're trying to do i- i would think anyway but uh but i can't let's see i'm trying to think of another movie that i've seen lately and i can't think of isn't that funny you see them_1 you see them_1 all the time and when you try to recall uh-huh well it's good entertainment and it's it's so easy to do uh yeah yeah Blockbuster's so successful i we don't go to them we just go we don't watch that many but when we do we just go up here to Kroger because_1 on Tuesday they're ninety nine cents each for all their movies if you get down there in the morning you can you know get some pretty darn good movies but uh but boy Blockbuster lot of people do go to them_1 don't they uh-huh oh one one would doesn't work at all of them_1 got to have each oh uh-huh yeah oh i see well and it's successful the way they're running it so can't knock it uh-huh and you live in Richardson my wife just made her call she talked to someone in Pla[no]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
golfer well well that's about the way i am i don't consider myself a good one but i do enjoy it i usually play a couple of times a month sometimes more but lately it's been just about that but i do enjoy i think the one of the things i enjoy the most is the beauty of the golf courses um-hum you can get out there yeah that's really neat you can just get out there and lose yourself in it and forget everything else in the world except what you're seeing out there um-hum yeah it really is and you know it's so frustrating i keep wondering sometimes why do i do this because it's so frustrating you think you do pretty good one day and you're doing a whole lot better you know and then all of a sudden you go back out and it's just terrible you can't do anything right boy i'm improving uh-huh and you think my goodness why did i think i was doing better i don't i guess i could i've never been to a gol[f]- to a major golf tournament i uh watch them_1 on TV a lot um-hum um-hum really um-hum i'll bet um um-hum well i've only been playing like about three years now my husband's played for twenty five but i just took it up about three years ago and uh we play in a lot of couple's scramble tournaments we belong to a country club a little ways outside of Dallas and we have developed a tremendous number of friends that couples do this and you know it's fun to go on vacations and things and go to golf courses you can meet some really neat people um-hum they really are i just love them_1 um-hum um-hum that's right um-hum that's right and you can just do your own thing and be relaxed and really really um-hum um-hum yeah i have never played in any tournament except just a scramble they have a lot of them_1 there at the club you know they have A B C D type tournaments and then they they have the club championships and everything with the me[n's]- women's slots as well but i don't know i've just never really gotten into that now my husband and all the men i mean they love the real competitiveness of playing for money you know uh-huh but i yes they do i don't do much with it since uh most of theirs they have a traveling league and uh most of their meetings and all are during the week and i don't don't get to play except on the weekend i work during the week all time um-hum someday when i i get where i live closer to the club and partially retired maybe i'll uh be able to play a little more but um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
we're supposed to talk about crime in the city and uh seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays doesn't it well it is but our crimes up here uh is i think it must be in most cities now but i was listening to the news the other day and they said they thought a lot of it the reason it was up so was because of the uh so many people are without work nowadays economy's so bad that's a good that's just what they quoted over the news uh i don't know if i'll believe that or not but it it does seem up and uh what kind well we got a i think we got a pretty good newspaper uh we have two the Morning News and the uh Times Herald Morning News seems to have the largest circulation i think it's a pretty good it's a locally owned paper the Herald is owned i think by the Times out of uh LA or somewhere but well they don't no not really uh they don't play it up i don't think uh but there there is too much of it you know uh too many homes broken into we had our our fact about uh last year sometime our home was broken into we yeah we uh uh i didn't think ours ever would be burgled into burgled but so many in our neighborhood had been and uh because we live on a corner and back up to a real uh highly traveled main street but uh we were so uh sort of yeah and i never did get a security system but since that happened i certainly have it's uh uh i guess excuse me just a standard uh with the uh all the doors and uh uh infrared thing you know motion detector pre[tty]- pretty standard yes yes it's monitored and all that uh and i think uh the thing that makes a lot of noise would would suffice i really do but uh this deal that was part of it for you know three years or so you pay the unit off or whatever and uh but it uh the monitoring's not that bad though because uh uh we've goofed it up you know several times you'll hit the wrong key not intentionally or something and and they call back pretty quickly so i- i guess it's you know i think it's all right but i to answer your question i think uh uh i think uh that is a pretty good deterrent in itself whether it um-hum well it's got a back up system that doesn't work supposedly tha[t]- uh if it's cut supposedly it notifies them_1 anyway supposedly who knows you know but that's the selling point and i think they're probably i think it probably does these things are supp[osedly]- supposedly pretty good boy they sure advertise them_1 you know so many of them nowadays but uh well don't y['all]- don't y'all have a pretty high crime rate up there i'm not saying it's any higher than anybody else's down here we seem to or or not here but the statistics seem to say that i don't know is that right i would gather probably from drugs and i think that's the reason it's so high everywhere but i don't think there's anyplace used to years ago you thought well these little small cities and all wouldn't have that problem but they do we've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it uh as anyone you know that's a good question i don't know i don't know what the solution is i really don't yeah yep the and nothing seems to change and uh i'm not sure that anything will because these if something could happen to make these people not wanna buy it uh but they wanna buy it so supplying and demand long as somebody wants to buy it somebody's gonna provide it for them_1 so i don't know i don't you know i don't know what the solution is i really don't i don't think anyone does in fact	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay well just to let you know i have uh two uh children of my own i've got two boys uh one four year old and one two years old so so i'm just starting out wow wow that's quite a spread that's great well i guess uh in one of things that that uh i like to do with my boys when uh when i get home is i like to try and spend a lot of time with them you know they're not very old so they can't do a whole lot yet but they like to uh spend time with me we just oh just do various things nothing really they like to be outside as much as possible right uh but you know the weather's trying to turn now so yes i i'm i'm in uh Dallas right right right you know one o[f]- one of the well one of the things i've noticed is one of the trends i've i've noticed is that uh it's always too easy t[o]- to just plop your kids down in front of the TV and let them watch movies or or play video games or something sure sure that's okay no it's okay um so that was the thing that i- i noticed that i know a lot of the people lot of friends that we have they have a tendency to do the same thing and one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible although it really is very easy to do that type of thing just plop them down in front of the TV and let them be um entertained that way and uh seeing as how you've got some older children i w[as]- i'm wondering how did you handle that when they were growing up um-hum um-hum um-hum right right um-hum right um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah right um-hum um-hum right oh that's nice that's great that's great i know we'd i'd like to get into do more camping and outings and things and i think we probably will soon as the boys get a little bit older but uh you know for right now they don't you know just getting out in the front just being outside is good for them they like just being outside um-hum um-hum right that's true you don't see many leaves around Dallas um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay uh what what is it what does camping mean to you and and what camping have you done hm well what uh uh what what do you mean by environmental camping oh okay but yeah that's neat i'm not not not had that available uh anywhere that i've lived at well uh first what what state is that California okay i'm in Texas and uh uh but most of the camping that we've done we we spent uh ten years in New England uh and my wife and i did a lot of tent camping before uh our first uh boy was born uh there in in uh state parks in uh New England and uh he[re]- here in Texas there are are state parks where they have uh uh shelters they're called uh they're wood frame on a concrete slab but screened in kinds of of shelters and uh but they have uh electricity and uh water at those cabins and there there's cabins well that's uh the no the uh there's uh one outlet and a light in the cabin uh an overhead one overhead bulb and then just outside the cabin there's a uh faucet uh coming up out of the pipe coming up out of the ground so that there's access to water like that uh well uh no it's it's the the ones that i'm familiar with are are b[asically]- uh basically wooded areas uh Texas has an awful lot of uh man made lakes and uh uh tend to be uh wooded areas around those lakes i'm in i'm in Dallas northeast uh y[es]- yes oh yeah yes yes there there you could uh you know depending on what kind of camping you wanted why uh you go an hour in a different direction here you go three hours in any direction and it's still about the same uh that's a difference but we also well well we didn't we took a break from camping uh for with the the uh boys until they uh they got into uh scouts basically and uh and then our biggest one we we rented a uh pop up tent trailer uh several years ago and went up to uh the Black Hills and back down through the uh Colorado uh Rocky Mountain National uh Park and uh Colorado Springs area and so forth Pikes Peak and that was a that was a lot of fun yeah oh okay uh-huh yeah yeah yeah yeah and right right a[t]- a[t]- a[t]- a[t]- at two she's old enough to walk but not too far i would guess and and yeah well right right but you also don't do a lot of of hiking associated with the camping i i presume yeah yeah well that that sounds good sounds good and uh yeah yeah and uh uh and and uh although it it after a while it gets uh with teenage boys at this point well one's uh in college but uh uh uh it it turns different in that uh the problem becomes one of getting getting time when they're available and don't have other activities uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

um we our subject is golf well good because_1 i thought my goodness i'm i'm a definitely a beginner at golf um i took lessons a couple of not last spring but spring before last and uh i really enjoyed it and i had taken years ago and i never could see that what i was doing was causing that little ball to do anything um but when we[nt]- i took this time you know it actually went up in the air and and i- i mean i could see that what i was doing made a difference and so um my husband and i uh took together he had played some already and then we started playing some and and we played in the summer a few times and then i teach and i don't have time to during the school year much but um well it just seems like it just is all a it really does and then uh and in the spring we've we've been lucky enough to go to several of those tournaments around here the uh one at Las Colinas and uh the By[ron]- Byron Nelson and i've loved watching so i'm i'm definitely a good spectator for not so much on TV but you know for live well now you know actually i have o[ccasionally]- occasionally watched a little of it and i never did ever before i took these lessons my my son uh plays golf and he's oh he loves to watch it on TV so i guess if you play a lot you right well how about_1 we[ll]- well what about you where is that uh-huh tha[t]- is that very far uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh sure uh-huh it is uh-huh uh-huh right uh-huh uh-huh oh i know i think that's that's great uh-huh sure so uh how long have you been playing oh wow uh-huh uh-huh well um that i mean that's what they all say is that you know that's one of those things that you just can't start young enough especially i guess if you you start early and you jus[t]- get get good lessons and you do it right i guess and i- i guess so it really is interesting so uh-huh oh my well you're doing real well well um uh di[d]- and so do you play around here some uh-huh where would you play here uh-huh oh so is Fire Wheel not as expensive oh well i i course have you ever played at Plano well well is it comp[etitive]- well we've played that's where we've played mostly we've played at Chase Oaks too but um oh horrors i mean we just lose {jillions} of balls and that's discouraging isn't it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh i guess uh this is a a topic near and dear to my heart since i am a uh am a healthy eater well i'm not uh i there really isn't any kind of particular food that i i don't don't like really and i like a good Italian restaurant or a good uh um uh especially like good prime rib so if it's uh nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that and i live here in uh Rome New York and there are a lot of good restaurants around here uh-huh uh-huh really well no i i'm in upstate New York and it's actually very inexpensive i there's a there's a place um half a mile from me here that uh has uh fantastic prime rib for uh eleven dollars a whole meal you know a potato and salad and soup and the whole whole nine yards so it right yeah i was going to this place up the street from me is the best i've ever had so i'll have to go there when i get there get to Dallas uh-huh sure uh-huh no no i'm not into the the don't do the the raw raw fish like that but i do like uh like a seafood bar like a raw raw bar like oysters and things like that uh that they uh i go on i'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business so i uh find myself down in Melbourne Florida ev[ery]- about_1 once once a month once every two months or so and uh go and hit the the oyster bars down there quite a bit uh i love that and um and uh Maryland's great you get the crabs it's like i can't go anywhere where i where i don't enjoy myself so that's true bu[t]- yeah well yeah it's really strange that that that seafood is so expensive because when you in reality uh uh i say that the oceans have the greatest re[source]- resource of food on the planet and yet we haven't as human beings haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically so we've managed to uh figure out how to get at just about everything else but uh but not uh not seafood what yeah yeah i like yeah i'd make a a wicked chili and uh li[ke]- around here the big spicy thing is like uh buffalo wings and so uh people they you know you go out to get the chicken wings and those are really hot and the hotter the better an[d]- right sure yeah uh-huh my m[y]- generally my my scalp will start i can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot weirdest weirdest sensation almost like a tingling but uh i don't know but uh yeah well there isn't isn't too much in the way of restaurants that i don't like things that are kind of oddball like uh Thai cuisine i i never been really fond of that stuff you talk about spicy that'll that'll literally blow your head off it's so hot and i can handle just about any kind of food without uh um well but that that stuff is goes one notch beyond uh my tolerances so although i guess on this topic i talk about the uh service in a restaurant is always nice though too that's one thing what's that yeah well i find that lately that so many people are working you know they're working waitressing jobs or waiter	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
ah i guess my personal opinion i- i don't mind paying taxes necessarily i I just sometimes wonder if our money's being used in the best way ah sometimes when i hear what what they're even wha[t]- even what the politicians are making you know when when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that ah i think that's just a bit too much to be paying them ah and that's all tax money when you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much it's just billions of dollars that's i think is just being thrown away yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well i- i know anytime there's there's a big uh uh budget cut you know i work with the state and anytime there's there is a budget cut or crunches it's always the small guy that that gets hurt it's never the uh the person that's making a hundred thousand there it's always the person that's making the least amount and ah and an[d]- sometimes we're running around there i see these these ah ah supervisors running around ah having meetings i- i really don't know what they do sometimes wonder are are they really doing anything or yeah yeah well they got so many hidden taxes that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying because go to a grocery store or something like that and you're paying a little tax here and you so yeah gas i don't know about you guys i but there's probably at least about twenty five to to thirty cents of different taxes on on our gas and you don't realize it yeah yeah well i know they say like with Reagan they say no new taxes but they changed the ah deductions on you and that just raises your taxes you know they just get it a different way so i mean to me it did uh raise my taxes yeah i- i heard someone say that uh if they would just something about uh with the uh the defense budget all that extra money they're throwing back if they cut back by so much percentage it could throw back about six hundred dollars on an average six hundred dollars	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the topic today is credit cards uh why don't you go ahead and tell me some uh some of your favorite uses for a credit card if if at all that's applies okay well i wish i was in your shoes Pat i uh i was i wa[s]- i was in pretty much control of my credit cards up until the point where we moved down here from South Dakota and then uh it took my wife and i about two months to find a job so in that interim everything went on the credit card and uh so now we're slowly trying to pay it off and if i would i just keep thinking if i would've just been able to take that money and put it in a savings account instead of right i'd be uh you know i'd i'd be doing all right today but no i've got those darn credit card bills hanging over my head right well that uh always a possibility um okay okay_1 well i uh while we were doing like i said we were doing all right you know we'd put gas occasionally go out to eat or pick up a small gift or something you know some clothes or something but and we could always pay it off when when the bill came and when we moved down here and everything was going on the credit card i think we we got a little rampant we you know went out to eat out everything and you know we'd we'd have to go to Wet and Wild and we had to basically play tourists the first the first month that we were here and of course everybody takes credit cards so it got uh it got way out of hand but thankfully we're we're now working to pay them_1 off and and we haven't put anything on them_1 in a couple months it can it sure can well what uh what do you find are some of the best advantages of credit cards um-hum that's true right right that's right you can you certainly can well i understand that you know you can't even rent a car hardly or uh get an airplane ticket without a credit card it's right well even if you have cash it's hard to if you're under twenty five and you you have cash you still can't get still can't rent a car you have to have a credit card and that uh i don't know okay you work with TI then okay well you don't e[ven]- speaking of cash you don't get the five dollars for the phone call you ju[st]- you get the gift part isn't that how that worked if you're a TI employee well that's all right that's that's an interesting incentive we uh we wanted to do it because we weren't from the south and i think we would a[ble]- we'd be able to well not yeah exactly you know get get to i still have a hard time uh accent you know i- i can't i- i just can't understand what they're saying but yeah there are okay where are you originally from Los Angeles boy there's a change i suppose it's not as cold there as it is here now well what's life in LA like okay a lot of crime and seems to me you know i- i couldn't understand why it would be such a heavily populated area if there's so much crime so much smog so much traffic okay	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay we're on uh recycling and uh i am not real well informed on exactly what Richardson does i know that we uh they ask us to bundle our newspapers and we do that and we recycle our aluminum pop cans and stuff but now Plano has quite an elaborate system don't they um-hum um-hum uh-huh oh okay okay and then they recy[cle]- they separate it oh that's a neat system oh uh-huh well i know our son and daughter-in-law live in Plano and i know they have commented on the system i don't know that they know that it worked that way but they have the two separate containers and stuff oh that is interesting does i wonder if that means that if you don't do it you suppose they will come and knock on your and that that is interesting you know will you be penalized if you don't will you you know uh right right that's true except that it's hard to match and you know when you have uh cans you know from the the market and uh you know vegetable cans and et cetera and oh they don't take vegetable cans this is just their aluminum cans well then yes it is poss[ible]- that's interesting i wonder uh huh wouldn't you really like to know i'm sure if nothing else call the sanitation department say okay what are you doing i think it's a very good thing i think that uh i think it helps that the city is giving you a nudge to do it because i think there are a lot of people that don't do it and i can't say that my husband and i are real real conscientious we got started on the aluminum cans because our uh grandson was collecting them_1 uh to raise money and uh stuff for an organization he was in so we start[ed]- collecting them_1 and now he's through so we['ve]- we've just we've kept on and it's interesting too that we have to drive we drive to Plano up Plano Road to uh just inside your city limits to you know turn them_1 in to dump them_1 in i sure there's bound to be some here in Richardson but we just haven't really seen them_1 advertised or you know something and well that's interesting um-hum well i haven't noticed uh i haven't noticed Richardson you know making that big a d[eal]-	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay what do you think of the public school system first off do you have children that are in it oh well then you should be a good one to know because i my children are grown now i now have grandchildren in the school system so uh i don't have first had experience right now with it so what do you think right that's correct yes it is i i agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren we have a uh fourth grader and then we have one that's in kindergartner and and i know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children was doing were doing in the fifth and sixth grade you know it's amazing to me and stuff that i didn't do until i was in junior high which of course shows my age that's kind of scary right now yes correct are you finding that uh since you're doing substitute that you're wanting to do full-time um i have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms and and d[o]- are you do you find that uh-huh um-hum be um-hum um-hum right uh-huh well i i know that this again this this friend uh is in the Plano School District and she teaches uh uh it mus[t]- uh emotionally disturbed children and she says she has some six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade and she says she's getting very frustrated and very depressed because the school is pressuring her to pass them_1 on even though they're not ready but because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something i didn't quite understand it and uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Laurie okay i'm supposed to ask you how do you make use of your credit cards and i'm supposed to compare those with my my habits yes right no i do not uh-huh oh okay sure well myself i always tr[y]- i'm i'm a traveling person and i'm out of town quite a bit so i use credit cards quite a lot also as far as everything from service work and gasoline in my car to my lodging entertainment and for everything so that's uh as far as using them_1 outside that i'm not i don't use them_1 too much but i don't think i i think my wife is sort of like you she uses a credit card most of the time so she does most of the shopping for our household so she'll use them_1 more than i will yes but so it's me i'm always i'm the that always goes to like Dillard's and i'll go in and charge something and and i'll have to give them_1 my driver's license they'll have to look up the number because i'm never carrying a credit card but i do carry like my American Express and my Visa which i use for you know primarily work type things this is my first call by the way so oh is it really all right so we're both beginners then i've had this for a couple weeks and i've been out of town so this is my first time to to use it so no i was given this topic yeah they give you they assign you a topic you call the eight hundred number have you tried it yet okay when you call the eigh[t]- eight hundred number they assign you a topic and uh pretty uh cut and dry i'm not sure a couple about about two minu[tes]- three minutes i think but i really don't have too much more to say in regards to credit cards i one thing i've always tried to do is when i get my credit cards i always try to pay them_1 off because_1 i just sort of detest paying interest and uh like years ago my wife and i got married she was the one with a little better heel than i was because i had my credit cards i think up to the limit and i was giving ten dollars a month and everything like that but that was like thirty years ago so now it's a little different i get a bill and i pay it the same day it comes in or at least i try to and i just try to tell my kids how much i hate paying interest so they should follow the same rule oh you bet it's a it's an absolute savings you bet that's that's very handy well i think that's all i have nice to meet you and uh give it a try i think you'll enjoy it okay thank you bye	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay uh i guess our topic is about movies and uh what a coincidence we got a baby sitter and we went to the movies this past weekend and we saw Cape Fear it is it's really good oh how's that i i heard that's a a movie that uh you really can't take children is that true oh oh yeah yeah because uh the little boy dies yeah oh oh oh uh-huh oh i wanna see that one well Cape Fear was was more suspenseful it was really suspenseful so that that's that's a real good movie to see uh no and no it uh it's kind of i don't know it's kind of both i guess but it's not it's not as bad as Silence of the Lambs but uh it's just as suspenseful i think and it it was a real good movie and then we saw Beauty and the Beast because_1 we have two kids Fievel Goes West but uh those were those were okay so and then oh boy it's been it's been so long since we've been to the movies but i we've rented some videos and i think the last one i rented was uh Mortal Thoughts with Demi Moore and um that that that's okay that's pretty good oh and um What About Bob yeah yeah we rented that one and uh uh i guess that's probably about it have you rented any movies lately oh yeah that was good we rented that one too uh-huh yeah yeah so do you go to the movies often or uh-huh yeah yeah well we have two little kids so it's hard for us to get out and go to the movies we have to dig up a baby sitter and and that's only the only time we can go out so our time is scarce oh but um we we we tr[y]- we you know we're we're big movie people and and we try and do and i don't i don't know about the last movie i've seen on TV that was real good um oh yeah um Bertinelli or what's her name i can't yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that was real good i saw that one uh two part series and i heard it was a true story yeah i think that was probably the last movie i've seen too and and then i saw that other movie about um Mother Daught[er]- Mother Wife Murderer did you see that one yeah did you see that one that was was really good too that's supposed to be a true story too yeah i guess a couple weeks ago or something like that boy we see all the same movies yeah um-hum i know yeah yeah yeah huh well we sure do have a lot in common if you're ever in town we'll go see a movie but and we don't really do y'all have do y'all still have drive-ins up there or hm we may have just a couple over here	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
-[ok]ay uh let me see i've got two children one is uh both preschoolers one is two and one is um four so and um this is my first year off and i've always worked uh the time that they were little and so i decided to hold off on my job for a while and stay home with them and spend some more time with which i hadn't been doing so oh oh okay yeah uh-huh yeah um-hum yeah well that's what i was doing before i was teaching for a Richardson School District and um it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little and it was really hard yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right that's right and that's what was kind of w[hat]- what where we were w[hen]- you know we i really didn't have to work but i felt like i really wanted to work and i felt i aw[ful]- i felt like boy i was sure was missing a lot and they were growing so fast and you know it's like do i really need to work you know and i and it that choice was there i really didn't have to and you know so i did have that advantage there but it's different you know it's an adjustment to make also uh-huh yeah wow that's great uh-huh um-hum yeah ah that's great because_1 that's uh-huh um-hum yeah kind of grows on and they do what they see and you know um-hum yeah uh-huh yeah yeah yeah plus you teach middle school so i'm sure that you are really you really boy oh boy i taught early childhood so i had the little ones and um you know i saw it there too and you you know you just oh it's it kind of an eye-opener you know so um-hum yeah i think you're right yeah right right -[ok]ay yeah yeah i agree yeah uh yeah yeah i agree i- i know exactly what you're	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay oh yeah i guess we're sort of we're stuck with that down here Brad we have to be but uh been it's been difficult suffering with them through the past few years but it looks like they could be you know on their way back a little bit our quarterback's hurt right now he's gonna be out for a couple more weeks at the very least and may miss the rest of the season course if they're lucky enough to make the play-offs he may be ready for then we're we're fortunate to have a you know a a fairly good back up quarterback that's come in but i tell you what the people of Dallas uh they love their Cowboys i'm a i've been here since seventy four and uh they're quite easy to easily to get attached to and uh we've got our new coach now Jimmy Johnson which i we li[ke]- we like what he's doing they've forgotten about Tom Landry he's a great coach in his day but they've forgotten about him so who oh yes who who's your favorite team right sure no well i'll be darned why sure um-hum right so how how's your team doing well good the Giants are having a sad year i know maybe w[e're]- maybe we're both teams of the future huh oh we're well it was fantastic they had a hell of a season oh i know they had a great coach i think they're they're missing their coach but most of all they're just they're in a rebuilding type of thing they've got they're quarterback's down too right now so the big th[ing]- oops big big Phil's trying to come back hold just a second that's that's my other line sorry Brad okay so anyway Phil's trying to bring them_1 back right now i guess who they play this weekend oh it's a big game yeah they play at up in Philadelphia play in New York well yeah good chance there hope so i think we right and we just hope we just hope Dallas makes it and of course all that depends on what Philadelphia and New York does too so i don't know that's true because both our teams are like eight and five you guys are up what seven and six i guess yeah i hope so their first play-off games travel to Detroit i believe and that's that'll be a tough one on right yeah it was there but they lost them_1 playing there but uh still a tough game they but you got Emmett Smith versus Barry Sanders it ought to be a little exciting be a good game anyway you bet yes yeah he was doing well and the kid from Houston they drafted from Houston uh they gave all that money to they've got a lot of high dollar players i tell you what do you this is off the subject a little bit but what do you feel about the amount of money these guys that are are making and uh the amount of time	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you feel about uh drug testing in the work place i think we need something in place to uh to solve the problems i certainly uh feel that it ought to be done in public safety situations you know airline pilots and flight controllers and people who run trains and buses and taxi cabs um-hum yeah um-hum yeah one of the issues that came up for me personally was that uh we see i've gotten involved in uh foster care and i've seen a lot of uh kids come into foster care as a result of their parents being on drugs and uh there's probably a lot out there that could probably stand public assistance or being rescued uh which aren't identified and so uh testing at the work place in uh in in general i think is probably a good idea to to save some of the kids yes um-hum um-hum yeah um-hum yeah um-hum yeah well our company uh testing when you're hired is a requirement and i think they have a policy of uh random testing but uh i don't know whether they've ever done it or not i kind of wish they would um and we do have an employee assistance program that's uh good for uh drug abuse uh treatments and other psychological uh problems stress in the work place marital problems whatever's what you know a lot of times i see problems here at work though uh i remember a few years back i had a uh schematic drawing that needed to be done and i was in a hurry to get it out well i sent these drawing the rough draft over to drafting and i usually do a pretty decent drawing myself when the drawing came back uh it w[as]- was apparent that it had been done by two people because the line work	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay d[o]- d[o]- do you work outside the home or you a student you're a student oh okay so you have a wardrobe to choose do you wear more dressy type clothes or casual or uh-huh uh-huh oh oh oh does your does it change pretty much from does it change from season to season or is it pretty standard uh-huh well it seems like you know war[mer]- w[armer]- even in the winter you go from your warm car to your warm building so there really isn't that much of a of a difference or in the summer it's it's mostly air-conditioning course you do wear cooler things but i um don't work outside the home right now i have four little ones and so my my clothing doesn't need to be probably as fancy as yours but um you know mostly during the day i wear the the casual type things and and i have the sweaters and the in the winter and fall and and cooler things in the summer but i for my husband he wears pretty standard all year round because it's so {climatized} his work situation but we just recently done something that we found really helpful with his wardrobe and that is um we send all of his shirts and his slacks to the dry cleaners and we hadn't been doing this previously i was you know washing them and ironing and taking care of them_1 at home and we found that it makes them_1 wear and look so much better to have just everything dry cleaned i don't know whether you well we uh figure it's pretty much worth the expense just because um the the dry cleaner comes right to his place of work and picks the articles up and takes them_1 and dry-cleans them_1 and brings them_1 back the next day and then they give the company a fifteen percent discount so it really it really is not that expensive and we figure you know what it saves on wear and tear and then and saving me having to do it and they look so much better when they're dry-cleaned than when i do so that it does it does and that's kind of a uh j[ust]- just a you know thing we've recently started that's that we found really helpful no he doesn't he he wears if he has an m[eeting]- a meeting or an important thing he wears a suit and tie but most of the time it's just dress slacks and and you know white shirt usually and a tie so that now that's interesting do you wear w[hen]- when on the days that M[onday]- like Monday through Friday do you wear slacks mostly or dresses or do you you're not a dress person uh-huh oh uh-huh even even during the week they do huh or i mean on weekends do they not on the weekend oh oh huh what about like shoe type things do you wear mostly dress shoes or do you wear tennis shoes or what oh well i guess you couldn't because you wouldn't have jeans on oh so can you wear right what you wear to school to work you don't have to change well that['s]- oh uh-huh oh oh well that's interesting okay well can you um let's see about two weeks is all m[y]- uh my brother he yes well he's in Plano that's just outside Dallas yeah oh are you yes Plano yeah um i wonder should we wait until she comes on and and disconnects us to talk about all this or okay let me just should we finish let me just ask you a couple more things about clothes and then i'll and then she should be on um oh what was i gonna do you do you like the s[uits]- do you wear suits or do you like more more feminine type dresses that style huh tailored yeah tailored	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
um advice on son or daughter going to college uh that's advice that i will need in time future for my children rather than the one that i have uh personal experience with um i suppose i would ask what the child wants to do in life and wha[t]- what the child hopes to to get out of college and what sort of college would best meet meet those needs okay um-hum what advice would you give i guess one clear cut piece of advice is by all means visit the college campus uh stay in a dormitory if you can go to classes talk to faculty members and students yes i'm thinking what what problems my children might have with that um but i agree with you what is yeah well o[f]- cour[se]- course realism is i[t]- it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and you're willingness one to to work during the summer or or part time and two um to to take out loans to assume uh debt after college yes um-hum see uh mine is twelve that's my gut feeling too i my son is certainly not persuaded of that hello oh yeah uh yes i didn't have a car at college i mean think it's more an inc[onvenience]- -[in]con[venience]- a burden to to provide for it uh i didn't do any of those although i feel less strongly about TV's and refrigerators	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well i'm in a i'm in an urban area i'm in Dallas and we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem uh even a more major problem uh in Dallas some of the major problems um drugs seems to be re[lated]- related to quite a bit of the crime we have now there is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with uh people trying to get money for drugs and uh i think that's a national problem though it's not unique yes uh-huh well now we're pretty close to the golden triangle aren't you right research triangle and all of that and um i'm sure you have a lot of students there uh and a lot of researchers so you you may have a you know perhaps a little better economic climate but in all your cities now it seems like th[ere]- there's a a crowd that's really effected by this bill really really hm well here uh i'm not sure how many Dallas has had i've uh Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four i I don't know a a number every week uh Dallas is having quite a few it seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or or like i say drug related uh i guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values seems like a a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to um i the economy is lousy um-hum boy that really that really takes someone who's bold to do that well now do you find that security is very good in in a in a town home uh-huh well that i see yeah well i think you hit on one point there is you know each other i'm i'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything uh i am oh about three blocks off a major road and uh a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs i guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the the commercial districts and uh i'm over the northeast part of Dallas and it's a in a nice neighborhood the houses here uh before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so and course everything's down ten to twenty percent now but we have uh one one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away and now that the economy is bad they have trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the uh uh they're not nearly as selective as they used to be and course that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex you start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so uh i'm sure that aggravates it also but unemployment now in Dallas or in Texas is up around six point	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay um capital punishment i- i know that's kind of a touchy subject i- i personally believe that there is a need for capital punishment um especially you know in some of the the real violent type murder and and crimes i feel like that it's a it's a justifiable punishment do you oh oh dear oh um-hum um-hum i agree i think it just it jams up the system and you know we spend thousands and thousands of dollars keeping them_1 there and and i feel that yeah it's not fair to the public and it's it i think it's a terrible shame that's right now do you have um what types of capital punishment do they use or in Texas what is legal right uh-huh oh oh um-hum um-hum now we in Utah they have uh either the firing squad or the lethal injection are the two methods that are that are used here and i know um not too long ago it's probably been two or three years now that um one of the people chose to die by the firing squad and and i well i think that was the last one that died here was by the firing squad and um so i know those are the two forms of punishment they use now but you know just the other day we had a uh man that was on death row for for killing his sister-in-law and her fifteen month old baby and then they came just two days ago and and said that something had not been done right with the trial and so now they've they've just h[ave]- have to start all over again go through the same process all over again and oh i think that's ridiculous i just what a waste of money and time and resources and you know oh no i have not oh um-hum um-hum oh i don't know i i've been called to trial duty but i never they canceled it you know before i got there so i've never never had that yes um-hum um-hum oh no oh um-hum oh no oh uh-huh boy um-hum yes well i don't know about your situation there but here in Utah they're we're having to build new prisons because there is no place to put to put these inmates they're just the prisons are so full and so we're spending more and more money building new ones when when all these you know inmates are on death row and that's just you know oh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
-[o]kay you think you're getting your money's worth i well that's probably the next year's agenda oh ye[ah]- they're finding the way the tax you every time you turn around and i- i think one way or the other we're gonna pay for the bureaucracy i guess and uh it's one area that's uh really i- i think hurting the economy more than anything i think the taxes have just every time you turn around they they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products and i- i- i think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now that's right that's right yep that's right well i think that uh that the problem with the sales tax of course is it's an unfair tax across the board uh as far as ability to pay which a[llegedly]- allegedly allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards but uh now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of you know taxes on everything they buy and where people that make you know two hundred three hundred thousand dollars a year certainly a portion of that they aren't going to be paying taxes on you know and uh that's the unfair equity inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue but i don't think it is anymore not in Texas anyway that's right that's right that's right that's right and that's the unfairness of the thing but uh i think taxes well you know like other things if they don't affect you you don't worry about them too much i have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still so uh it doesn't i- i think uh uh you know generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line which is uh you know and uh i guess if people got thirty forty thousand bucks to spend on a car uh that's their prerogative you know i- i- i don't have a whole lot of y[ou]- you maybe you buy that you know and i don't mean to be knocking uh yeah there are there are and the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that i guess you know unless they really want it buy something that you know more well it it's just like having taxes on or exemptions for kids you know it's a way of increasing the population that that was one of the initial ideas of you know giving exemptions on kids on on federal taxes and where you exempt things like uh uh one of the best things i heard on taxes to stimulate the economy someone brilliant deductor probably Lloyd Bentsen said that all you know if they gave back the ah deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be you know spending more money using their credit cards now i don't know if that's true or not but if you look on all interest things not just credit cards but on your cars and you know a[ny]- any kind of interest that you're paying from a personal point of view that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchases so that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go you know tax things that they don't you know to a degree well like booze you know example they keep raising the taxes on booze it gets to the point you know it makes drunks sober you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well AIDS is a nasty terrible disease and you die from it so i think that uh they need to look into it and it's kind of like cancer i don't you know how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer i think it'll probably be as difficult uh how about_1 yourself yeah they say a million people are infected with the HIV virus and uh yeah i thi[nk]- uh in the country America yeah and they they have millions i don't know uh i've just heard it on the radio sometimes you hear things that on the radio that you know could be true or couldn't be uh do you feel like this is a i guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this AIDS research uh do you think they should spend more what do you think Doug of Mister Johnson magic do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of other a bunch of the media you know i took advantage of the opportunity when you know he came out i- i talked to my kids about it you know it's something that i hadn't d[one]- hadn't done before uh i'm glad that Mister Johnson's changed his tune on uh safe sex to abstinence or i- i was glad he did that for young kids because_1 a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting uh let's see what are some of the other questions i you don't uh let's see i don't have any friends that have the disease i guess you might might not is it pretty nasty yeah it sound awful is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly and and oh really	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
-[he]llo Jim oh one of my favorite towns i'm i'm in Houston yeah yeah probably although i would imagine that i've had uh uh some warmer weather and and more humidity than i think that's typically a little drier out there has it really yeah Austin is a uh actually i ha[ve]- my uh my brother and sister-in-law live in Austin and it is one of my favorite locations it's just i- i think it's beautiful how long have you lived there yeah practically a native yeah uh how hot does it get there in the summer time yeah yeah yeah that's correct i mean being i think being a little closer to the uh to the gulf we it has a moderating factor but again what we what we lack in the heat we make up for in the humidity i lived in Dallas for six years before uh i was transfered down to Houston in uh nineteen ninety and uh Dallas got hotter i mean temperature wise but i you know Houston can get just as uncomfortable but for some reason an[d]- and i guess it's uh not having just the extreme heat i mean we had uh one one year we had in in Dallas uh a you know i guess a week or more where it never got below of that eighty two or eighty three degrees at night and then over a hundred every day and that got to be awfully oppressive yeah yeah you know you know it makes you wonder how anyone ever lived before air conditioning uh how much snow did you get in Kansas no yeah oh no oh no yeah oh no did you did you uh keep it going yeah yeah yeah well i have never lived anywhere uh well the farthest north i've ever lived is Raleigh North Carolina which is certainly you know not your ice snow country uh and it got you know reasonably cold up there in the in the winter time but i have never lived anywhere where i really had to battle snow and uh i don't think i want yeah i had some i had some friends who lived in uh New Hampshire for a couple of years and then they moved back south because they said you know it just prospect of every morning having to get out shovel the driveway to get out and then shovel the driveway to get back in the morning and shovel it again the next morning they said it just got to be too much yeah yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay Scott let's uh talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university and i have some yes some children i have three boys and they're all quite young and so we want to plan for their education w[e're]- we're saving right now and we're getting bonds and and uh and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to how about yourself do you have any kids so i imagine you've gone through the experience yourself of selecting your college your own college good what uh what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to um-hum um-hum what you thought huh just the degree itself well that's a that's that's good because i did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work i wanted to get a school that was small enough that was personable that you didn't have a lecture w[ith]- uh hall with about fifteen other students competing for the professor's attention and uh but you i felt that i got a a pretty good uh undergraduate um i went to Utah State University which is in Logan Utah and the nice thing about it too is i knew that i wanted to get into business and that their business College of Business was accredited and well known at least there in the State of Utah and around the surrounding states and so forth and so i i felt like number one you nee[d]- you also need to to see what kind of name the like you mentioned before the name the college and university can can give you and another thing that uh another reason why i chose that was the the finances i wanted to make sure that i would be able to afford it that i wouldn't get through four three years of of the undergraduate work and and have to leave and uh so i did a lot of talking with friends with family with uh counselors at high school and also read some some books on on the subject at the at the library and uh it was kind of unusual because my my two older brothers and i all went to thr[ee]- three different universities depending upon what our choice was so hopefully we we chose the one that was best for us and i i felt very comfortable and good about that so i i don't think so i don't know the the way that tuition is increasing um exponentially it's it's it's kind of hard to set aside money and have that money grow same pace that the college tuition is increasing i uh and that the your children can use the benefits of that university well that that's an excellent idea that's an excellent idea one thing that uh that we did uh and my parents and our family is that we weren't able to afford um the kind of education that we all desired so my parents stressed that we get excellent grades and that we apply and try for scholarships and uh scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education because my parents couldn't and what these scholarship could not supply i was able to to work for and and save and and and get also my my brother um he's a he's a medical doctor right now he had to you know once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree he had to take out some loans and he's he's working to pay those off so i i think that the uh you know once you get past uh the initial stages of it that there's different options you can use and and uh the student loans are are a good option and yes and and as you're well aware that tuition's not ch[eap]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well un[til]- until recently i was taking the Wall Street Journal and i thought that was a good way but i have about five different magazines that i get that keeps me up on things you know it's a week or two late but uh that's how i'm staying up uh do you like how it's presented on the news it it so it it makes you feel like they're uh wanting you to take their opinion yeah i've noticed that too and it's kind of distressing isn't it and they just i've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words uh usually uh just that sway the whole uh report that you know by just a couple of words so communications huh were you looking into becoming a reporter or uh-huh i bet that's a interesting job yeah there's one that i'm reading right now it's Information Week it says AT&T to account for the the benefits that the AICPA now says you have to show as a liability it's going to cost them_1 seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety three to account for that and it'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more yeah it is and yeah you have to stay up on stuff and i bet in your your job that you have to do you read the Wall Street Journal do you c[an]- can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective i guess they do that so they don't get scooped you know so they have the big story	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i'm sorry um hobbies let me see i don't know if that took or not i'll do it again okay what are your hobbies i hear you have kids right that's your full time uh hobby right um-hum um-hum um i try to do some painting although i'm not very good at it i well no yeah i i have you know i inherited the genes that make me think i'm creative but not the ones that give me the ability to be i i do some sewing mostly out of necessity um i'm making drapes for my house just because_1 i'm yeah well it isn't and it is it is you know actually the sewing isn't the hard part it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because_1 you need so much room yeah i've been doing that and that yeah that but usually i have to do the pleats by hand so that at least i can do i[t]- you know watching TV or whatever but yeah and i've i've gone and you know put the needle through my thumb a few trying to get it through but yeah so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything but i i need to do it i have let's see i have a dog and a lot of fish keeping fish i guess is my biggest hobby and um yes no it depends on and how frequently they die and how much that bothers you that's you don't do as much as as i thought in fact my problem i had fish as a kid and they always died i mean immediately and what i'm what i think now is the reason is i kept the tank too clean because you have right you need to let the bacteria build up and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance and i would just take everything out and just like you know wash it with scalding hot water and and it would kill all the bacteria and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again so right that's right so now all i i only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing and i don't try and sterilize that's right that's right well i've had them_1 i guess it's been two years now i've had a a tank here and and then back at home i used to have a small you know five gallon tank but that never worked well and i have fifty five gallons now it's a lot easier no no not yet that's right i really do but you know yeah i just have you know what they call community fish you know guppies and platies and and basic things i don't get into the ex[pensive]- right right the expensive ones they are and they're very expensive and you know when you die it's like it when when they die it's more like an investment you've lost an investment so no not really only if there's baby fish you always have to isolate those you get um well no they have uh breeders it's a little plastic thing that sort of floats and you put the mother fish in there and then it's got like a trough underneath her so as the babies come out they fall down the trough and there's a hole in the middle so they fall onto the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either and that's you know it it kind of works but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate and on occasion if you get a real small one it'll fit out the slots that's right so but you know it works i guess yeah oh they'll eat them yeah yes it and it's funny because_1 the one i have every single month without fail she has babies and oh no a[ll]- all the time and um i've and she's supposed to her variety it says they won't eat the babies and i've seen her do it so oh it's terr[ible]- well i mean it makes you understand that you know things are different we might right we might decide what's proper and what isn't but you know that's the way it is for them yeah that's it yeah because if the baby's strong enough it can swim away fast enough and go hide so yeah yeah yeah yeah huh no not really i i try i a[lso]- i also i play a couple of instruments	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well uh down here in we've got um trials by uh jury in criminal cases and the sentencing can be done by the jury normally although the judge can sometimes do it how do y'all do it up there we've got a lot of the[se]- uh in federal court they have a uniform sentencing guidelines that pretty well leave it up to the uh judge to assess the punishment in a certain range right here in the Dallas area if you are sentenced to ten years or less to incarceration in in the uh penitentiary you will never make it to the penitentiary and you'll serve about a year in the county jail and then be released because of the jail overcrowding well the judge has a better idea of what is probable ranges for that particular type of offense where a jury is just doing it for one time well you know in in civil cases they can have uh as few as ten of the jurors agree on a verdict but criminal normally requires unanimous they might make a change on that and that might make for fewer mistrials course in civil cases trial by jury doesn't necessarily work if you have a big complex uh business type case where a jury could get totally lost in a lot of those cases people decide to just try the case before a judge and just not have a jury and you had up there North Carolina that case of that lady who poisoning her various husbands what was it Blanchard or Blanche yes we've we've been reading about that no i don't remember reading about that we've got a case going here where a man is accused of poisoning his wife with arsenic now and the jury the case went to the jury today and the jury's deliberating right now well the collective wisdom of the jury usually prevails	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
you do a lot of uh camping up in Utah well in in the mountains up in Utah or where well i go camping a lot with the Boy Scouts we do we do several types uh we do several types of camping one type of camping we do is called a Base Camp where we simply go to camp set it up and spend the weekend the second type of camping we do is backpacking where we simply go to an area backpack in spend a night or two and then backpack out and then a third type of camping we do has to do with uh aquatics well canoeing for the most part we we we take a long trip every June on the Buffalo River in Arkansas for about nine days of canoeing uh no the scouts have to have achieved the rank of First Class which they generally get done after a year and then they're eligible to go on the trip so we'll have boys on the trip that'll they all should be twelve by the time we go all ranging all the way up to seventeen well these hikes that we've taken our boys uh generally are about six six to ten miles but uh they'll go they have the chance to go to Philmont in July and then they'll do the fifty mile or whatever hiking then you have you have a Buffalo River up there too huh i wonder if they're connected to the one in Arkansas well we do some family camping too where we just all go for a weekend but we only have time to do that a few times a year because the scouts go camping well assistant at the moment uh but we're very we're very busy because we go camping every month except February and and then in July the boys either go to regular camp or to Philmont and the other months we all go camping uh Philmont's up near your end of the woods it's in the uh i don't know exactly where it is but it's somewhere in the Montana Montana Wyoming area but we we have boys that'll go there in July and they'll go up there for a week or two here you can go to Philmont but you have to be thirteen as of January first of the year you want to go which is in July so most of the boys that go are at least fourteen well i have one son that's a scout i have also a daughter she's a Girl Scout they don't do as much camping well i'm afraid the nearest mountains to us are several uh hours away well that's why they call it Plano because it's just plain it's plain you can from my office on a clear day i can see Fort Worth which is about thirty five miles away well i i live uh just south of Plano in Richardson which is the next suburb just south going down the freeway	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

will i return anything right most the time they have a pretty good guarantee uh only thing i've had lately is uh my kids got all these Barbie kind of toys for uh Christmas and uh i[t]- it takes them_1 less than a day and they're broken in one way or another but i don't know if that's just kids or if that's uh maybe those type of parts sh[ould]- should be for older kids i have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with them and uh i don't think they're unduly rough but maybe they are i don't know but uh a lot of the little Barbie sets they come with real little pieces and they're easily lost and easily broken but but you know it's been a while since they've uh gone through the Barbie st[age]- doll stage huh right don't remember her breaking the right well that's one thing they've got they've got every type of imaginable camping on the beach and all of these come with oh like l[ittle]- tiny tiny little plates and little sunglasses and uh my three and a half year old has wanted this Ken doll and so i finally got her a Ken doll and uh less than a week later the arm was broken but they were real good about replacing it that's one nice thing is they're real good about replacing it right well the the you know those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way and she's not that strong that i would she's not that big of a girl that i think could really take a grip on it like a bigger kid could you know yes that was about it and the Barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable and that kind of stuff but oh is that right well do you see that there's a little big problem with electronic things don't buy them_1 because_1 you don't need them_1 yes oh yes that's the way yes well you almost assume if you're gonna have problems with it it's usually be[fore]- before that warranty would expire any the first one you never even needed it it's time to replace it yes i- i think these extended warranties are gimmicks really a lot of it we bought when we first married we bought one on our TV and that there was it was a five year after the first five years and that was ridiculous yes they're a pretty healthy price and you're trying to think oh maybe i'll need this you never you always think gosh if i say no then i won't you know but i don't know if you probably got your ti[me]- worth out of it anyway yes the little well you probably are real careful of the brands you buy and the when you do buy things you probably watch what kind of type of quality yes	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay i'm definitely for dr[ug]- random drug drug testing and any kind of drug testing to try and get rid of it taking away people's free agency how many times do you think drug people have taken away people's free agency no but as long as you are working for somebody you are more or less under their jurisdiction right it wouldn't bother me and i don't think it would bother any of my family i have a son that's a doctor and i have a son that's an airline pilot and i think they're they are among the top ones that should be subject to to that uh one of our freedoms so called taken away well i'm for doing it because i think that it is a protection against the majority of the of the citizens you're just trying to argue show another point i have a son that's a doctor what about him right maybe they would feel like they were being um-hum um-hum i just really feel strongly against drugs because i think that they're they're tearing our nation apart they're tearing families apart they're tearing good people that you know uh c[ould]- would be ass[et]- a asset to the community and to the nation and i just think that drugs is i just try so hard i would try so hard to get them out of wherever they were	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh well uh the Cowboys are my favorite team that's pretty easy to say lot easier than it was a couple years ago but they had a big win today uh did you get to watch it oh are you a Cowboy fan right yeah uh-huh right yet right right yeah they made it to the play-offs finally like just you know two years ago they were one and fifteen they won like just one game and so it's a pretty fast turn around but this year they made it to play-offs and today was their first game and they beat the Chicago Bears so everybody's really going crazy you know down here they're going crazy so so they turned it around but yeah they have a lot of young exciting players now up i mean everybody was real upset you know when they fired Tom Landry but you know now it's like you know they're doing good so everybody's about that uh-huh right right exactly you know um-hum right yeah uh you know they have a young team it's you know a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old you know players every year and you know same coach same everything so now it's you know like a taste of something different they're all not you know mister nice guys like they used to be now it's like you know tough and dirty team so everybody is really excited and well it's supposed to be the Redskins but you know we beat them already we beat them this year in in Washington so you know so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl but you know it's just that we have to play every game away you know it's gonna be tough but but ever[y]- their competition i[s]- are teams that they've already beat this year so i mean Atlanta they're in it too and we beat them and uh see Detroit we play them next week but you know we should beat them everybody feels like we should be able to beat them_1 so it's so everything is uh looking real good um-hum right right right yeah well the Cowboys are on a roll they've won like i think six or seven in a row now so they're supposed to be the hottest team in the in the league going into the play-offs so uh right yeah Troy Aikman he got hurt at OU so he transferred to UCLA right um-hum they're playing tonight in fact i'm watching them on TV right now but they're doing some Virginia really well they're doing good tonight yeah they're winning they're winning forty one to seven right but yeah and uh that's right Aikman did go to OU i forgot about that yeah uh UCLA yeah but the Cowboys did good today i mean i was proud i thought i thought they would get beat today because_1 i mean they're so young you know play-offs	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
why don't you tell me about the Brewers well the problem with the Rangers is they've got a lot of offense they just don't have any pitching and really haven't had any pitching for years they're the top offensive team around but defense and pitching wins your games over the long haul well that's true but he only comes every five times so he can't win them_1 all and he's getting a little bit up there oh yes Rollie Fingers well Rollie was Rollie was more uh well i guess he's uh is he in the Hall of Fame already i don't even remember you got to be retired for five years to be eligible yeah we had a game here where uh we had Goose Gossage this year and Goose and uh Ryan combine and they got i don't know Ryan got his three hundred something win and at the same time Goose got his three hundred and something save and they were you know the same number and they said that it was an unusual occurrence to have that yeah but he's not coming back well no they got him at the very beginning of the season but he and the m[anager]- and manager Bobby Valentine didn't come along so Goose is Goose is history oh yeah he's a he's he's definitely headed to the Hall of Fame But the Rangers have you know a a pretty good lineup now um with the with the addition of the uh Dickey Thorne at uh short stop that ought to help them but their problem is other than Ryan and an occasional flash of brilliance of other people there's just nobody there well at least he got to play in a championship the Rangers have never won the division so w[e're]- we're obviously not going to last year yeah i think he's history he is history Detroit well they didn't yeah they he went to Detroit they really didn't get much for him yeah they released him and he had to go around trying to sign up with somebody but he proved to be a total disaster yeah yeah he did something he i saw i saw him hit a grand slam once in a game when i was there but i also saw him drop a ball that cost a couple runs ended up costing the game so he could you know he could be both brilliant and with a bat and just a disaster in the field it was early on it got better but it was pretty bad at the beginning	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
hi uh how do you feel about gun control yeah uh-huh i don't think so either and i think that every gun should be covered cover covered because i think that uh and it doesn't hurt people to have a waiting period yes right uh-huh but i kill a uh yes i remember when that happened so there isn't really a gun control there no well i i think that every gun should be covered from rifles and the automatics and and handguns because people need if they're out after a gun they need a cooling off period we have guns in our home but my husband uh used to hunt all my sons hunt oh we have sometimes i think they're about as dangerous but uh yeah well we live close to the Wasatch well we live right on the Wasatch front so we're only about well we have mountains in our backyard and the deer come down and eat our uh shrubs during the winter uh-huh we we had a snow storm the other day and the deer come down and eat the shrubs they keep them trimmed for us oh my heck i think it's about twenty well it's about twenty eight here no but i- i'm i well don't you think too if the government i mean like in Yugoslavia and these places that the government comes in and takes over China don't you think if the people had a gun they would have more say in in in establishing a democracy yeah uh-huh then they must have been they must have been hidden somewhere because they came out uh-huh um-hum uh-huh uh-huh is that right oh oh no that's what i think that it should be is registration and guns that can be traced but then no i think they have um and you just hand over the cash and that's it uh-huh well i'm about an eight on that i think that uh that we need gun control but you know so many laws would be uh necessary if we'd just use common sense you know just registering the guns and wow i don't know i guess people lose their common sense when they when they get mad or when they uh-huh uh-huh oh really tha[t]- that you're in the bar and somebody has a gun next to you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh i think it's a real good concept uh drug testing procedures would have to be refined from what i've seen on the news there's a a a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy poor procedure in uh drug testing yeah um there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their in their uh test but they didn't know for sure what it was but it was a drug so they got turned down and uh turns out it was a prescription or people getting somebody else's blood test same sort of problem that happens sometimes with these some of these uh like AIDS tests and such yeah oh yeah yeah yeah um-hum yeah yeah yeah i not very long ago worked for Wal-Mart and about a year and a half ago they instituted a uh a uh drug testing program uh well drug and alcohol testing program it's it's not a random through the s[ystem]- as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is a a blood test um but and uh i think the big problem though is is they send these off to large labs and then they have thousands and thousands of the samples that uh going through it in a day and bottles get mixed up and things like that a potential for inaccuracy yeah yeah yeah yeah Sam's is part of Wal-Mart yeah oh yeah the company i thought was a great place to work um-hum yeah they got to have had two or three years in with them then you start buying stock and you have a have a little taken out of your check each each payday to put against uh uh stock portfolio uh not portfolio just you know against Wal-Mart stock but uh you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while uh you're supposed to get five minutes um do you have any idea uh let's see we[re]- you were you were tested for drugs as you got into uh as as you got into TI yeah uh now uh were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through or oh okay yeah yeah yeah they they it was after i was already working there and they weren't testing any of those that were already working so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

and they're talking about uh federal government aren't they hm well i saw a program on it recently and and it said everywh[ere]- time they cut you know like fifty five million dollars on a certain thing then they brag about how much money they cut and then they go and spend that money somewhere else and that's why the budget is never balanced The Gramm Rudman Act didn't solve the problem they just take all the money that they say they cut and they spend it somewhere else or they you know they pad out their staff or you know spend it in bounced checks at the commissary or um-hum um-hum um-hum well i think they should they should limit the Senate to one term one six year term um-hum right and and don't let them_1 come back and and uh keep Congress to um two terms and two years a piece and then it'll be overturning and they won't have the same people there all the time and then all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their their payoffs and kickbacks and and that'll keep them busy enough so that they won't have as much influence and because_1 that's one of the things one of the biggest things is that um the fact that they're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or ano[ther]- whether it's the oil companies or the automotive companies and like the air bag thing the air bag came out what twenty years ago and only now they're getting it put in cars you know and the oil companies aren't really aren't responsible you know the Valdez proved that and then the government doesn't jump on them_1 hard enough to make them_1 do anything it should've been done immediately um-hum right no they listen to wherever the money is right yeah they're not as efficient that's for sure	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay_1 i guess we start talking about the budget okay you you live near the nation's capital what can we do about this mess yeah yeah i see big opportunities in Europe opening up uh it just it just seems to me like we ought to be able to go over there and help the people become a capitalistic society uh yeah yeah another thing i think the uh that the President could do right now on a short term basis to get things speeded up is help out the working people right now the middle income people uh give them_1 some tax credits i think they've done that i seems like i remember that happening once in my past i'm in my forties and i basically remember getting some sort of tax credit years ago and i think it helped i think we bought a car uh at that time because we got some sort of a rebate well i've always believed in paying my fair share of of of taxes oh and whatever my government says is my fair share is what i think i should pay uh i don't necessarily agree with people who go out of their way to find loopholes and not paying their fair share yeah the lady who does my taxes for me every year it seems like she's got a new suggestion and sometimes i go with them and sometimes i don't uh since i no longer work uh usually it's not very complicated anymore but uh i no longer work uh oh it's been almost three years ago i had some uh strange heart problems occur and uh so i'm more or less hang around the house and uh that sort of thing yeah it's uh i know for the i thought maybe i would go back to work especially during that first year and then they finally decided that then maybe i'll never work again so it took some while to adjust to it and it and it took some adjusting financially and things like that i can no longer afford things that maybe i used to take for granted and i certainly can't invest money like i used to well what kind of work did you do when you were working oh yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
did you hear the topic Carol right oh well good i feel the same way just the last few years things i've purchased have been you know pretty good quality and worn well as far as clothes or have driven well as far as cars and sort of have lasted you know for a good part yes oh i think i think the only problem i've had in the last two or three years is i wa[s]- i was in Germany a couple of years ago and bought a comforter and some pillows and some pillow cases i didn't receive everything but you know that's you sort of take that chance you buy something like that pardon me oh a little bit no i just bought one of those little handy dandy Singer sewing machines my wife you know when you're using you're the little small one that fit in your hands i purchased one of those the only complaint i might have there is it takes so long to get the item you bet yeah a lot of times i'll do the same thing one thing that happened recently is about three weeks ago i bought a new pair of glasses and two days after i bought them i picked them_1 up and i went back two days later which is four days after i purchased them to uh get them adjusted and i noticed they were running a thirty to sixty off sale so i paid the higher price so i did you know ask for a little interview with the manager and he came over he he granted me a few free goods you know to make up the difference which i thought was fair sure but overall i think i'm uh no right any trouble getting it back sure i try to buy most of my clothing from like the the bigger guys the uh the dealers of the world people like that because they they don't have any trouble returning goods they they purchase so much from these manufacturers you know they can return anything so you're just generally speaking you never have a problem taking something back to them because it didn't wear properly or it came apart or something you bet you bet oh absolutely yeah m[ail]- mail order the same thing i buy a few things from Kebelsk right and sporting goods and uh sort of the same way you can uh have a certain amount of time period while you can just return something if you're dissatisfied with it in anyway and they're very easy get alo[ng]- get along with and they don't mind taking something back i bought a Lincoln and uh up with the exception of someone hitting me and uh me tearing it up a little bit it's been a very nice car about a ninety one it's about a year old now no not really you know it's like the old uh saying they don't build things like they used to and i really believe that in some situations but in probably in cars that's very true but they don't build them like they used to but	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay yeah it's something else yeah how about_1 that huh yes yeah that's true uh th[e]- i think it was last year around this time it was when we had the really really hardened cold snap i had a pipe break on me so it flooded the house and everything so i was trying to be prepared this time around uh well it was an outside pipe so n[ow]- this time i made sure i wrapped them_1 up real good um-hum i don't wanna go through that again um-hum um-hum ah um-hum yeah well with us we were out of town over the Christmas holiday and our neighbor called us to say hey you guys did you leave the water running yeah they saw the the water coming out from under the door yeah so we cut our vacation short but i guess it wasn't too bad uh we ended up getting all new carpet downstairs and part of the upstairs so it wasn't it wasn't a real pleasant but uh you know looking back i[t]- it was a good deal because we did need new yeah exactly um-hum true um-hum um-hum oh sure sure um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum that's great yeah so you had the kind of weather that uh it was nice to go out at night on yeah that's great um-hum um-hum um-hum hum oh i see um-hum right yeah um-hum hum wow um-hum yeah right right that's right you know uh y[ou]- you usually don't think of that uh you know being i guess being in a urban area if it gets cold you know y[ou]- you well let's think about water freezing and pipes breaking but down there they got all those crops to worry about yeah yeah r[ight]- i remember that that's right right yeah it always happens huh sure i'd say there's pre[tty]- quite pre[tty]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
-[hell]o okay so you were with TI huh well any stay any place that long they got to be doing something right right i uh work for myself i sell uh metal fabricating equipment and tooling and uh uh oh CAD CAM systems and things like that and uh consequently i can't really discuss big time benefits at the moment although i had worked for Univac and Pitney Bowes and some big companies once upon a time and uh i think most people don't necessarily realize the cost of them_1 and they're somewhat probably getting out of hand well i think uh oh the way i go[t]- right well no it didn't necessarily say other than salary but what would you consider to be kind of important i guess such as well i i imagine that's what they're referring to you know like uh your health insurance and pensions and all that kind of good stuff uh and they grew up around you didn't it uh-huh yeah well i think that's one of the keys that most people uh probably put above benefits that's why i work for myself basically too um-hum right right well i think as long as it's comparable with you know the job or can that uh you aren't being picked on in the sense of being the whipping boy dollar wise in the corporation you you know you know you got to i yes yes we[ll]- right well i i wouldn't say they aren't motivated by money but i would say that there are other things that are equal or greater important i i guess if you make enough money uh if the money were really big bucks i guess some of these other things you could uh live with for a while anyway until you had enough but yes right right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and i have to admit that we just moved to Plano recently and that i hadn't voted in an election yet and although i did go down and register and i that's the first time i've ever done that ha[s]- what's been your voting experience well do you feel like uh i mean i um-hum uh-huh yes um-hum that's really true that's kind of the way that i have felt it i also feel guilty um not knowing and not going the extra mile myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates course we only have mostly the representation given in the media but um i have felt since i've been here that i haven't known what the issues were and that i because_1 it was a new community um-hum it does yeah um-hum um-hum no um-hum no right um-hum yes and uh and uh i also feel especially in the presidential elections that uh since we're back on the old system of electoral votes and or that and that you don't necessarily your vote doesn't necessarily elect a president right and it's kind of it's awful and and it's hard to feel like one person but i know that it's important and i feel guilty that i haven't done that here haven't taken the time and i know that you know people can make a difference but it's hard to to face the corruption like you say and uh and to know what you're up against and it makes me feel bad that i'm glad i mean i am thankful for the uh nineteenth amendment that it gives women the right to vote and uh i'm glad that that happened and everything and i hope that i will become a better make a better difference in but i haven't done that so far um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum right right right um-hum right yeah and it's not very likely i mean it seems like th[eir]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Mike i'm calling from Dallas from Richardson okay well good you know our subject is on boating and sailing and quite honestly with the of being involved in a part ownership of a little bass boat i have never really got into sailing or boating oh do you well great well that's neat right i've seen some nice nice sailboats the guy that used to live next to us in Richardson before we moved twelve years ago or whatever he had a sailboat used to park it right in the uh driveway and it seemed i think it held probably uh it must have slept four people anyway right i i understand i'll tell you it's oh they are and you know we have a swimming pool at our house and i think of all the time now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever that i put in there i just could not imagine a boat because_1 i know it's a lot of maintenance oh gosh yeah you bet sure you bet i know my wife and i were first married her aunt and un[cle]- aunt and uncle up in New York they kept a boat on Jamaica Bay and we used to go out with them and back then they had bought an older Chris Craft and we were every weekend in just uh as we visited we were involved every weekend in just helping him redo this and refinish that we just worked all the time but their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen it was sort of neat we but i think that was the last time we were really involved in that was twenty years ago or twenty five years ago it is a lot of fun you bet i visited my cousin a couple of years ago my wife and i and our daughter and he had a place on the Lake of the Ozarks and he had a boat and uh i never seen so many boats in all my life people actually park their car when they get to their place they're staying an[d]- townhouse or condominium whatever they own and they they go boats i mean they go if they wanna go to a lounge to have a cocktail they use the boat and that was sort of neat yeah th[at's]- that's that's true that's exactly how they do it they go to dinner that way go to all the restaurants that was sort of a neat setup i enjoyed that we spent a week with them i enjoyed that but i'm envious i'm envious of people that have the big boats and uh you bet thi[nk]- you think you'd really enjoy it yes oh that's yeah that's great oh i know and putt putt sure well that's neat where do you work who are you with well good	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay you're probably uh more up on this subject than i am but the roles that women have played the last coup[le]- couple of year in our are couple of generations you bet you bet you know where i've noticed it more i think is i'm a traveling salesperson and i have traveled most of my life and i know just especially in the last oh ten years and really since the in the last half of dozen years i see more and more women traveling you know as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers i sell sporting goods and even in our industry uh there was virtually really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell and even in the last f[ive]- five or six years boy you see more and more women being involved and you know it's a it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing things you bet you bet that's sort of neat sure i think uh it's the a[ge]- age old thing every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on TV or something where the discussion comes out that you know women are paid less than men and they're and they're doing the same uh or carrying the same job responsibility and you know i that's a very true statement and it shouldn't uh it shouldn't be that way and i think so hope so an[d]- abs[olutely]- you know i've yeah they forget also i think uh a good argument for that is in the area of politics you know if if a a woman Congressman i'm sure makes as much as a man Congressman as and the same as a senator or whatever so they certainly uh they certainly deserve it all the way but i guess just the most significant th[ing]- change for me again as i mentioned it was just in traveling you see uh more and more ladies all ages with briefcases and uh and in their business suits and and going and i expect you're right in regards to having two parents now that's a good a good statement and i think if in the future it's even gonna be uh more noticeable and more significant wow you bet good point right now i'm self employed and and my wife's always worked she's a schoolteacher but for she started working and then when i first started my uh she was selling real estate at the time and hers was the only income we had for three or four months so you know she certainly did her part in help getting me established in my business and she still works everyday so you bet uh-oh enj[oying]- enjoying it what kind of work do you do well good right married yeah w[ell]- well trying to think what else i can say in to this subject you see the old uh cigarette ads you know about you've come a long way baby right and uh you think about this when you coming to a when it comes to a subject like that and it's really true women have come a long way and you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

so what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in America today yeah that's no i have to i have to agree with you i had an occasion a couple years ago to hear the R[ichardson]- Chief of Police of Richardson Texas speak and you know it's a shame a a criminal today not a murderer but a guy that breaks in houses and steals things and you know he does this and he does this for a couple of years hides all the stash and works off of it and then when he gets caught he'll be sentenced something like five to seven years but he gets five days credit for every day he serves i mean it's like a bonus to go to jail so subsequently a five year sentence means he's going be out in uh a year on probation i mean what he does the chief said is he just merely goes back to a s[tash]- stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate and uh when he u[ses]- s[pends]- uses up all that and spends all that money then he uh starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing now see that's a you talk about that's a crime right there well we don't either in Texas well it it certainly is and uh that would be a huge concern you know i don't think the general public really realizes this as far what goes on with our criminal system our judi[ciary]- -[judi]ciary system and everything else it's just uh it's terrible the way it is right now yeah as far as steps to reduce crime if it's uh crimes like we're just been discussing obviously we we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in to uh take them_1 off the streets but i don't think that's gonna happen because just like you said and our state's a good example your state's a good example and it's just not gonna happen as far as the murderers and people that commit rape and things like that i'm not sure what's right but i know that i[t's]- it's not right to put him in there and l[et]- let him live for years and years and years before you do execute him or whatever because_1 it's has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to clothe him and you know to i'm sure he gets to watch a lot of TV and i'm sure they have uh exercise facilities and movies and and everything else you know they can have a good time in no it really isn't it's a big it's a big problem and hopefully something will come out of it so i don't know i'm uh i'm pretty much of a hard person uh i believe in capital punishment i mean you know a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone i mean you know if it's just downright outright oh you bet i mean that's the only way to oh yeah and you spend thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars to uh take care of them_1 and all you know it's just unbelievable can you really gosh oh i know see meanwhile you're living in a country club situation perhaps you know yes the drug problems that's another one	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
let's see um have you heard anything in particular about the universal health care sys[tem]- uh health insurance program that they're talking about yeah yeah and it'd probably be cheaper to go ahead and pay a percentage of the local plan yeah especially for major corporations yeah yes well oh yeah they keep uh the AMA you've got to go through the AMA to get accepted into medical school and they keep a tight rein on how many people get in but uh now dental school that's yeah if they've got a glut on the market of dentists um i i i don't mean to be ugly about it but uh costs of dental work are pretty high and if there's something i don't necessarily think it needs to be driven down again but to keep it from shooting up of course dentistry i don't think has near the problem with like malpractice insurance and such that's probably the worst thing about health care right now is the unlimited capacity for suing for malpractice and it seems to be the burden of proof that on the doctor that he didn't do something wrong rather than proving that he did and if he doesn't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that he did everything just right then suddenly he's got you know two or three years wages down the toilet but uh yeah uh-huh yeah there are physicians getting away with murder yeah yeah yeah yes yeah yeah uh from what i've seen the better physicians are quick to ask you to go ahead and get a second opinion they're not feeling you know insulted they're it's like that's a little you know sweat off my brow simply because i mean you know th[ey're]- they're covering their own tail legally and you know a second opinion	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
all right i guess this is a great time to talk about fitness with everybody and their New Year's resolutions and going out and getting their regular exercise program um do you exercise regularly and tell me about that if you would uh-huh yes wow well that's great that's fantastic do you have that set up where you can uh listen to some music or read a book or you just uh go well good so you're goo[d]- you're using it yes because_1 you don't see a whole lot on a stationary bike yeah oh okay um-hum yes yes well you've got me at a disadvantage i do not have a regular regiment i do exercise periodically but it's whenever i uh i have a problem in that i don't make the time and i i understand the importance of it and in fact when i was in high school and college i was on all sorts of athletic teams and and regular programs but since i've gotten into a new job and into my uh career and into a young family time seems to escape me right now but uh one thing that i really enjoy is that uh i have bicycles and i have two older boys that they like to ride bicycles with me and we ride as a family and you know uh i actually live in Plano but i'm working here in Dallas and they have some excellent bike paths where you can go and ride for miles and miles and days and days and not see the same scenery twice which is really fun and uh one thing that i've been doing also is that mind you it's not regularly but uh i like to go out and go jogging and i do that and the boys get on their bikes and uh we we they ride along and i jog along and it's a nice time to spend some some time with the boys too so i'm trying to coordinate you know my family time in conjunction with my exercise time exercise program and uh we really seem to enjoy that and uh there there's a couple of reasons for that is my boys are very minded even at their young age and uh one of them_1's in soccer and the other one just loves to do it and so we get out and and do this and it i found out that it's very helpful to them also in my oldest boy's soccer league that uh he doesn't seem to run out of breath as much as the other boys do and he can stay in longer and uh and uh so i- i don't have a a regular one but i i really would like to set my priorities straight and and set aside time to do that i thought of different things i thought about going at the same time every day in the morning if i am generally uh getting up and heading off to work around six or six thirty which means i'd have to get up way early in the morning in the wee hours of the morning to do that and uh i've also tried to set aside time in the afternoon or evening but uh things generally pop up that preclude me from from doing that so i just need to get into a habit um-hum uh yes i do um-hum oh okay um-hum well great um-hum oh okay well um-hum um-hum well that's that's good that's one thing that i'd and the weights i'd kind of like to get away from because in high school and college i lifted an awful lot of weights and that immediately	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay_1 um i like watching Colombo and um Matlock and Quantum Leap yeah uh-huh um uh-huh yeah that one was what is that uh-huh yeah oh i well i haven't seen either of those huh-uh um i also like to watch Star Trek but it's on so late here that i don't always get to see it uh i haven't seen any of the movies because_1 i just barely just like in the last year or so got interested in it and they're you know already out with number six by now but so i haven't seen any of the movies yet but i no uh-huh yeah i've seen uh quite a few of the older ones i haven't seen really the new generation that much is there one you prefer better the older one or the youn[ger]- the newer one oh yeah yeah i do too i have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot i mean he almost hates the new ones because he he thinks the newer one is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something but whatever oh i think yeah yeah sure well let's see um i like to watch Colombo because it's like a mystery thing and that's sort of how Matlock is but Colombo is way tricky he doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto them_1 uh did you see the one um d[id]- um yeah there's like one on well we see it Thursdays at seven and it was this last time it was about this um movie director did you ha[ppen]- did you see that one really oh i guess i've nev[er]- huh oh i guess i've i haven't seen it before yeah yeah on the set or something yeah it was but i yeah i like Colombo probably the best of any of those mystery things but um there's no never anything good on Saturdays though i don't think so well Star Trek's on at five but i'm never home so oh i've heard of it a lot i've heard of a lot of people somehow or something they'll say so and so from Twin Peaks or something you know oh uh-huh oh did they end the whole series oh oh oh another show i like to watch is MASH	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you say you a Steeler fan so did i no kidding yeah Chuck Knoll as a matter of fact uh did the coin flip in uh yesterday's Super Bowl he looks real good he certainly had a an unfortunate uh end to a brilliant career well that's what i think i think the the the sad thing about the Steelers is that they stuck with the crew a little too long and i think that's the the biggest problem for dynasties is that you just really have to cycle people um yeah no yeah how about_1 Houston uh Oilers any more appealing to you yeah well i h[ad]- you know i was a Steeler fan and a Forty Niner fan um they've certainly built themselves a you know a great team as a matter of fact if they hadn't lost so many games early in the season i think they might have been a contender might have given Washington a game but uh they lost uh so many games early that they that their comeback made little difference at the end well Montana made a difference but as the ana[lysts]- analysts have said over and over again the game is won and lost at the line of scrimmage a smart quarterback makes a big difference and i really think for example yesterday Buffalo might very well have been in it until the end had Kelley been uh a smarter quarterback i- i frankly am surprised that um Marv Levy would allow him to call all those plays yeah and i think that's just too tough in a on a uh uh you know a guy i m[ean]- you got to be real real savvy to do that and i don't see Kelley as being that savvy i don't i think that's one of the weaknesses in the Buffalo offense myself because_1 they certainly have a heck of a defense although it was picked apart a little bit i mean Washington just looked phenomenal and uh yeah yeah it it's it's it's nine years ago yeah it's b[een]- been a while well it is it is a little disappointing and there's some it it's very interesting to see you know what's what's behind this is it is it the uh i mean you would think theoretically that the the draft picks would uh you know random and then free agency also makes a big difference uh i don't understand it i mean they just uh they they Denver you know went a few times and they didn't do anything uh Cincinnati they didn't do anything now uh Buffalo yeah well you know i think that's sad in a way because i think if you look for example there were a couple of calls yesterday that were appallingly bad i mean i just it's it's it's shameful and and i think that that once Pandora's out of the box you know so i don't know i- i- i- i think it can complicate things i recognize that but i sure think it's it's reversed some some calls that were bad calls although yesterday it didn't reverse one that was a very bad call w[hat]- well there yeah the[re]- there is that problem an[d]- an[d]- but uh i guess that that the real the real interesting thing is in the age of television you're going to get so much analysis of it that a that a game really for example yesterday when when Andre Reid	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yes i'm still here well that no i think i think it's on i'm i'm so glad i got hold of you i want um something came up at work the other day people are wondering how to choose a college and i was wondering how what did your parents do to help you choose a college oh oh yeah oh hum so you got to choose a college twice good grief yeah yeah um yeah that was the same way in in my family of course my parents were divorced so it was just mother and my grandparents but one of the key things then was what could we afford to do and i got a a co-op deal at one of the schools in New Mexico and i was there for a couple of years before i flunked out New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and that choice it was but men out women numbered the women about twenty or thirty to but uh it was just a very small school about three hundred students but the big the reason for choosing it was because of the financial aid that was available and it yeah yeah but then i my next choice in college was hey i move back wi[th]- home with mom and i i went to the local university to get my grade point back so a decent school would let me in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well i definitely think we need to start recycling i think it has got to be an individual responsibility until i think if we wait uh which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it's gonna be too late you know i've heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand and that's not too far away but i don't know how it is there it's very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much i take my pap[er]- i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store and i can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them_1 and there's some fire stations i can take newspapers to and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait -[un]til i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile um-hum yeah it's very hard to find a spot and then i don't know if you notice even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles that ca[nnot]- glass that cannot be it could be recycled but there is no place to no we have a pilot program in Arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they're having people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out and i think that's what it is gonna have to come to where we're just forced to yeah i think so it's just because they have to you know right uh-huh and i think it's going to come to that because some people will just not go to the it's a it's trouble for me to do what i do i mean i am willing to do it but yeah yeah it's very difficult like our garage is always full of stacks of newspapers and so i don't know i think there needs to be more places i also have a real strong opinion in Iowa the state i'm from uh i believe it's gone up to a dollar now everytime you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay ten cents for it and then you take it back to the store and you get it back you're forced to and uh you also don't see the litter there people just it makes it worthwhile to take it back and i've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian i don't know if you've tried it and they have on the ba[ck]- it's five cents okay it's still five cents and it even shows the states that yeah well wh[at]- some of them are five some are ten cents i am looking at it right now Texas is not one of them see so i have to throw them_1 away cause there is no place to take glass so uh-huh okay do they save like the paper the[y]- they use like the office paper good because_1 there is a lot of waste there isn't there right right right yeah something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage like i've decided Downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton you add water i'll i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later but i am going to stick with Downy because they were first you know i want them to have my business and i think packaging could be done much better there is so much plastic that yeah yeah and i think it's just people have got to be aware unfortunately there are a lot of people that just don't care and they don't wanna think about it and uh i just look at it as i don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something you know i want to feel like i at least tried and i don't know it just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it then we'll be forced to it may be too late very little that's another thing and if you've ever know like i know Amway i only use a couple things form Amway that it says this is burnable material well that doesn't do me any good because i don't have any place to burn it yeah and then just like the glass bottles th[at]- that says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in Texas and there's no place i can take glass to so i still throw away a lot of glass yeah and then the packaging really grips me you buy something it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of

yes uh we live uh right to the base of the Wasatch Front so uh uh as our children were growing up we spent a lot of time camping up in the mountains different taking our children with us or deer hunting or whatever w[ell]- well uh sometimes we did most of the time we'd we'd put up tents and we'd go up and stay for a week or uh weekend or go up into uh Yellowstone Park and and camp in the campgrounds up there but we really had some enjoyable times as a family and uh some real good memories how about_1 your experiences on camping uh what have you uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh well that sounds uh uh-huh oh wow uh-huh all those fun things huh yes i'll say well we uh when we were up in uh by Yellowstone Park we had uh moose that went through our campground and we had a a bear once that went through uh-huh black bear and then we uh we've seen a lot of rattle snakes uh in our camping trips and all of those creatures of the wild and like you say those really make memories of things the kids never forget but i think the one that really excited the kids our kids were quite young and that's when this moose great big antlers come walking right through our campground we had a fire going and and uh it just kind of sauntered through and went over to a stream and was eating and no no no he we uh didn't bother it and uh everything was fine but uh it's uh camping has really uh been a a great part of our life and now we're we're older all of our kids are gone and we don't uh uh fact last year was the first year i didn't go out camping on the deer hunt now we have quite a deer hunting season here in Utah and i didn't first time in uh fifty four years that i hadn't gone out in the mountains for the deer hunting so but anyway it uh yeah when the grandkids uh get a little bit older then we'll we'll we'll do that again oh uh-huh uh-huh well i would uh it's not like camping in a way but yet it is you're still uh on the right yes uh we got uh where we had a a camper then we got us a fifteen foot trailer house that we we took up and uh when we were going camping so we when we our kids were young we did uh pretty well rough it we were in some good snowstorms and uh speaking about_1 tornados up in Yellowstone uh one went through there usually they don't have such things here but it took down pine trees quite a swath and uh we were there right after that happened but uh uh those tornados i guess are uh pretty scary things um-hum that was amazing because that was like i say right up in Yellowstone and it's uh maybe once every hundred years or something we have something like that but uh and it happened and uh that was um-hum um-hum uh-huh um-hum oh it is it's it's beautiful we've spent a lot of time up there and that but that's a long ways to pull a trailer yeah n[o]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
hey Cissy what kind of books do you enjoy uh-huh uh-huh sounds like we like the same kind well see i read the uh oh Helen McImes i read a trilogy of hers yeah a s[et]- a group of three in one book uh she's the one that writes uh uh they're real good she's been writing for a long time and i was trying to remember she wrote o[ne]- uh she writes they've always have gone the spy um uh thing with them_1 you know setting in in foreign places or and they're they always have kind of a twist to them_1 oh yeah um-hum yeah those are good too uh-huh and then i got uh some of Robert Ludlum's i like those too do you like him yeah i get the S[upreme]- Bourne Supreme the Bourne ones i get them all mixed yeah i have a lot of those in hardback too uh and did you read Fried Green Tomatoes oh it's wonderful well my daughter gave it to me uh quite a while ago to read and uh then uh uh i guess what brought it to mind uh was that uh last time i went to see the movie and uh it did not disappoint me and it's it's just so well written of course Fanny Flag wrote it and uh it's uh it's got humor in it and a little bit of s[uspense]- suspense and uh uh and you'll cry well i think i didn't read Steel Magnolias but i think it's probably better than Steel Magnolias were the movie is anyway and Steel Magnolias was tremendous but uh this one it just uh sort of has a well my husband enjoyed it i i just kind of m[ixed]- you know mixed feelings i didn't know whether he w[ould]- it might be a woman's movie but uh he just he just raved about the actresses in it that they were so good and everything was real and it was just really good and the reason my daughter gave it to me is because my mother is in a nursing home and i think that uh she was trying to give me something to kind of make me get a message of but uh it was good um-hum um-hum well i would highly recommended it and don't get discouraged in the first few chapters becau[se]- well you may have to g[o]- i do to and i had to go back and reread because you have to get the they're telling two stories at once and you have to get it straight and get the names straight that's the thing get all the names straight uh-huh where you you're working with two stories and once you get that down it flows and you can't wait to get to the next part it uh it's one of those that you get caught up in oh i haven't read that book was it good okay_1 i'll have to see if i can get it oh all right wonderful wonderful no you can't i'd love to borrow it from you all right um we're all supposed to say what do we read for improvement what have you read for improvement um-hum i do too well i[f]- if you're like me there're so many technical things to read that when i read at home yeah i just don't want to to well of course i i garden a lot and i read a lot of gardening things but uh oh yes Neil and then the American Gardening Society puts out a real good book on on vegetables um-hum you don't need you have problems even with flowers yeah um-hum yeah it's a good place for them_1 if the dogs	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

have any great vacation spots to share with me oh boy where in Europe where in Europe did you go wow that's not you say you were there for five years oh five days uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i'm sorry i interrupted you you was always say[ing]- also saying that you'd gone to Rio that's wonderful um-hum so a l[ot]- lot of your big vacations have been international that's do you like to travel domestically as well do you do you take vacations around the country now uh-huh yes i can relate to that oh yes did you ski when you were there in Vail uh-huh uh-huh it's true it's true yours are much more exciting than mine um i think probably finances have limited us um primarily my family um because i'm the oldest when i left um my family went on some really fun vacations so it's more the things that i've done with my husband and and more recently our child that uh that we that i could probably talk about well i'm not actually i just started my family younger i mean started my family later um i'm thirty six and my daughter's only m[y]- well but my daughter's only two so at my age i think that my my mother i mean when my mother was my age i think that i was probably twelve or something like that it right at any rate we've really enjoyed camping vacations i think that that's probably the thing that we've uh done most each year probably four to seven times a year we'll take short short little vacations maybe three days maybe four days and there's so many places in the San Francisco Bay area that you can camp that you don't really have to go very far you can drive as little as an hour and get into a redwood forest and feel like you're just it is really nice to have that very close um there are some places up the coast near Mendocino and in Marin that have what they call environmental cabins so you can rent them fairly inexpensively and stay a couple nights and feel like you have a little beach house getaway so we've done that a few times too you know it's very rustic you don't you bring all your own things and you bring your your your cooler almost as if you were camping but there's a stove and there's a a table and and uh platforms for your bed mattress and that sort of thing so it's somewhat set up those we've really enjoyed i think what i'd like to do when our daughter's a little older and if we have other kids its uh the kind of club made med vacations that my husband and i enjoyed several years ago because there's so many different activities yes they call them club kids yes they have all kinds of art activities and sports that are tailored for kids and babysitters if you have children that are you know in[fants]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
how do you feel about drug testing Helen yeah neither do i i think that uh it's something that uh uh i i can appreciate if uh i were an employer or uh that uh i would want to uh ascertain the state of the uh employee uh i don't know that personally i would you know i i've started a new job um about a year and a half ago and of course had to go through the physical and the test and you know didn't have any problem with it now one thing i've never experienced is being randomly tested and while i you know don't have a problem personally with it as far as passing the test i don't know that i would relish being you know pulled out and said hey you know roll up your sleeve or or go use this jar but uh i think that there's some companies that do that yeah yeah that's that is a good point i don't want a uh uh pilot hangover yeah right yeah yeah yeah i have a friend of mine who works uh for a company in Atlanta and uh they you know made it clear about you know policy that they were going to start the drug testing and then you know advertised it about oh four or five months he said even before they ever started and uh he said one of his bosses was saying that you know should someone test positive that didn't necessarily mean that they would be fired and my friend said well they ought to fire him and he said well perhaps that's you know this boss well maybe that might be a little harsh and he said no i'm not about firing him for doing the drugs i'm talking about firing him because_1 he's so stupid that they would continue to do it with that much adva[nce]- exactly with that much advance notice you know if they are that dumb they ought to get rid of them_1 so i kind of liked his uh line of thinking yeah i don't know it's it's something that that uh i don't know i think that the uh and and maybe i'm optimistic but i think to a great extent uh uh some of the uh casual use of uh the baby boomers back uh you know in the seventies and the eighties perhaps is moderating now certainly that doesn't mean that there's not still a severe problem and especially with crack cocaine which i think is just a scourge on society uh but uh perhaps the recreational use might be declining a little bit and i hope it is oh yeah yeah yeah and then the one not only that i mean just everything i mean it's awesome to think of anyone raising children to me right now but um uh-huh yeah and at the same time i mean i uh if uh with the cost of health care and uh just all the additional uh expenses of of recruiting employees like i say i can understand uh the necessity of being tested and again that's only only happened to me one time but uh i didn't i didn't feel badly about it at all i was more than happy to uh uh submit to the test yeah right or certainly not working up to their full potential yeah but um well i don't know it's we're in such a perfect harmony on this topic and i do know that we need to keep with the topic so let's see what el[se]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well Liz what sort of things have you had to return lately because of poor quality um-hum yeah well i had an interesting experience with a sweater at Christmas time my mother got me two turtleneck sweaters one red one and one black one and i wore the red one and it was fine and i got i was in a hurry one morning to go to work i threw on the black sweater with this suit and i wasn't paying attention i was stuck in a meeting all day with a z[ipper]- zipper that was gouging me in the back and the sleeves were too and i was in this meeting all day yes it was yes same make same size same style everything yes as a matter of fact i took it back Saturday to Dillard's my mother bought it at Dillard's in Las Cruces New Mexico and i took it to the local Dillard's and said that you know there's something wrong with this sweater these sleeves are definitely two inches i'm very tall and have long arms so sleeve length is yes oh yeah oh i think some things are clothing definitely it seems like you have to pay an awful lot to get decent clothing and but then other things like oh blue jeans always seem to be pretty rugged and pretty tough and yes yes but i think anytime you get into high style items things that change all the time that uh think it gets it's tougher for them to maintain the quality course if you listen to the the Japanese politicians we're going in the ditch for quality and productivity and everything else um so did you buy the same brand the next time yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well do you have any children that uh go to college went to college are about to go or anything oh my goodness oh where did they go uh-huh uh-huh oh my goodness uh i have a son at the present moment who is a senior in high school and uh he has uh made three applications to schools that give a double degree program because that's what he wanted to uh take so he applied to the University of Texas at Austin and to the University of Pennsylvania and to Rice so uh he's waiting at this time uh to uh see what kind of uh acceptances and money grants might uh come in for him so um i- i think that uh it became very evident in the beginning of senior year when he actually had to sit down with the applications he had about six schools that he was interested in but he really decided that he wants to take engineering but he also wants to keep a liberal arts degree and actually get both of them and not all that many places actually give you two degrees so he he weeded out the ones uh that did not offer that kind of thing and just really wound up making three applications so um yeah yeah uh-huh right well yeah and and as i saw the fall progressing and um and his viewpoint it really became more evident that uh he this is what he wanted to do and he didn't just want to get involved in the sciences without having the leeway of the liberal arts and i don't think he'll ever be a um you know a kind of a research dedicated a test tube scientist so um i think he might wanna go to law school and uh use the engineering background maybe in patent law or yeah yeah yeah oh yes that's right yeah what uh kinds of fields did your children study in uh-huh oh wonderful uh-huh is that right uh-huh oh my yeah uh-huh oh my oh gee whiz isn't that wonderful uh-huh is he uh local here in town or is uh-huh oh good for him uh-huh oh oh yes i've seen those they're remarkable because they come right off oh oh good for him oh they've done well uh-huh oh yeah oh yes that is terrific that's right that's right uh-huh that's right you just use it when you need it and uh then it's you know gone and it it sure is very effective and then you can move into the next necessary thing that is uh right that's right it's amazing isn't it amazing everything they do these days uh uh-huh it i- i think it is too it really moves you from one thing to the other without having to hassle and uh you know even like with you said with the signs have to you know to change everything and uh you know um-hum um-hum uh-huh yeah oh really	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
well Liz do you own a boat um-hum um where do you sail at h[ow]- how large is your boat um-hum that's too bad we've g[ot]- we've got a boat it isn't a sail boat my i should say my family does also it's a it's a fishing and ski boat it'll hold about seven people but we have a lot of fun uh every year we get together for a a week down on a place uh it's uh it's kind of a resort we have a time share down there and take the boat and water ski and and go fishing early in the mornings when the water's cold and it's a lot of fun and even the little kids uh enjoy it i've got uh a six year old and and of course some of the other family has some around eight or ten and we have a great big oh it'll hold about probably five or six kids that size it's a big kind of like a a a water weenie that floats in the water and they can all get on it at once and they just have a blast we put a a life jacket on everybody and then you know just pull them_1 around and uh we burn up a tank or two of gas a day and get a really good sunburn and just have a great time but my experience with boating and at at least that way i don't know the sailing might be different i i don't know i think i'd kind of be too impatient to uh to sail but uh i don't know it might be kind of fun too just to uh relax and i guess it's all wind powered isn't it when you sail um-hum um hm so that's additional speed when you're is that what you uh-huh yes um-hum i see and you always get to be the one that's hanging over the edge um-hum sure hm um-hum hm well do you just drop an anchor when you find a place or do you just kind of let it go and you do take an anchor then and um-hum uh oh cut the rope huh how how large is your boat how many how many people could go on it at once um-hum are are they set up so you can spend the night in them_1 and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

i'm Bridget are you i'm in Lubbock yeah i go to school at Tech okay you ready for me to push one okay okay so what do you think about the elderly and their health care uh-huh yeah i think that's really sad yeah i have um my great grandmother was in one and i used to go visit her a lot i think it's sad because one it's so expensive just to put them in there and it's such a traumatic decision anyway and then it's like no one goes and sees them i think that's really sad i mean tha[t]- i didn't even think about that what i first was thinking about this topic and stuff and that's just that's that's amazes me you know no i don't think so uh-huh but they need someone to take care of them you know you can kind of see both sides i mean the people that have to be in one you know should be or people that are just put in one you know that do not need serious you know medical care i think that's kind of sad yeah that's uh-huh yeah yeah should go back to that think more people should do that hard as it may sound or be for some people it's not really that hard least it would be easier uh-huh that's true yeah there's going to be more older people whether they like to admit it or not that's true though i didn't think about that either people got to think about that and just i just think it's it's kind of sad even knowing if your you know if your parents would even want to go in one or not you know i mean my parents are like no way i know there's no way they would ever want to be put in one and i know that my parents plan to take care of their parents you know if it ever gets to the point where they can't take care of themselves you know they're going to go to Florida or whatever to take care of them that's what they have to do because they don't want to just put them in a nursing home they don't think that's right i guess it would depend on a lot of things like like financial especially and depending on how old they are and how you know i can see if like my grandmother whose mother used to be in a nursing home she used to go up there and see her every day whose my great-grandmother was in one she used to go see her every day and that is great but when she got sick then you know she can't go see her and stuff and you can't expect so i guess it would depend on how old they were too because if if the p[arents]- if the children were too old to take care of the parents then i don't think that would be very good either pretty touchy topic oh yeah at least they're pretty expensive but people always figure it as if they had a live in nurse too that's you know just as expensive it is because i know when my grandmother was looking to put her mother in that is a big ordeal she's like well it's just expensive to have a nurse twenty four hours a day than it is to put her in a a place where at least there's other people you know i mean and she went and saw her every day like i said and that's good i think because i don't think if you just put them in there and forget about them i don't think that's right think that's sad	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay um well why don't you go ahead and start because you have more experience it sounds like um-hum um-hum oh oh goodness uh-huh oh goodness so do they know what they're saying though do they seem to know the words that they're saying because_1 they're they're real young yeah because_1 that could be a blessing further down the road but it can also be a problem now uh-huh oh uh-huh oh goodness hm um-hum um-hum yeah yeah they'll be because_1 at this age they're real real young and they could pick up any kind of language it it's amazing how easy they can learn well i've uh i got two children as well my oldest is eight and my youngest is four and i used to teach and when my first one was born i was lucky enough to be able to choose whether i wanted to work or not and even though i had just gotten my Master's degree i chose to stay home just because i worried a lot about child care and really wanted to be able to be that person that raised my children and i like you're feeling the frustration of what they're picking up on that's exactly the worries that i had is that i worried about what kind of things they might be exposed to or pick up on and i was just really paranoid and i guess just decided to be my own child's caregiver and at times i've regretted it just because_1 i miss working with adults and uh you know speaking regular language more than the the children's you know kind of language right right as a cartoon once said i would like to have dinner with someone who can cut their own meat and that kind of thing um but now i'm getting up at the at the stage where i will need to go back to work and so i'm looking at this issue and my four year old is just at the point where she'll be starting kindergarten next year which is still only half day so we'll still have to look at that kind of of set up for her so um-hum um-hum oh uh-huh um-hum oh are you so am i yeah what part oh okay i was in the Phoenix uh Mesa area um-hum oh yeah because_1 now you're depending on other people that you don't know uh-huh yeah yeah yeah that's right yeah and even if you have someone there right at your own house doing that kind of day care you still always have that little worry i'm sure so that's that is a problem what kind of criteria do you look for when you are shopping around uh-huh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh well it's nice to talk with you um oh i guess i'll go ahead and start off with uh i think that there's two things that could be done that are procedural to uh to help the budget the first i believe in would be to give the president a line item veto um uh i think that a lot of times the the members of congress uh when they're faced with uh the possibility of having to to cut jobs in their district by because of shutting down a federal project or something just don't have the the willpower on their own to uh to make the tough decisions and sometimes it would be best to give that over to the president who who has overall responsibility for the whole country and can uh i guess be a little bit more insulated from from uh the concerns of one of one district yeah that's exactly right yeah one of the the uh there's a bill pending before congress which i'm trying to remember what it's called it's something like the pork buster bill that um if approved would make it uh uh uh you wouldn't be able to um put in uh new projects and things in a conference committee or at anytime where they weren't reviewed by the regular committee that has responsibility for that and that's like what you were talking about where they slip things in at the last minute and the conference committee is really the worst place for that to happen uh because no one uh uh has uh it doesn't go back into the regular committee for review after the conference committee it just goes back to the house and the senate for a final up or down vote on the whole thing i agree um-hum yeah it it really sometimes seems that there is there's nobody out there uh watching out for uh for we the people and making sure that the money is spent wisely uh and i don't know that just sort of seems to be unfortunately part of the just how the system uh operates now uh w[e]- gee is there anything specific that you think uh uh in the way of federal programs or whatever that would be eliminated to try to cut federal spending and just eliminate all that high level bureaucracy how do you feel about bringing home all of our troops from Europe and the Far East and letting Germany and Japan defend themselves yeah well we'll always have a presence there but we don't we don't need to have half a million troops overseas that's right um-hum yeah another area that's that i really think ought to be cut is is direct uh foreign aid	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay Martin do you do any exercise uh-huh um so those are more or less indoor sports how's the weather out there in Georgia uh-huh oh uh-huh well yeah i'm on a exercise program i'm riding my Aerodyne bike um half an hour every morning and i'm just about ready to up it to forty five minutes a morning and i feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time it's it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and um has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise no huh-uh i first of all i'd like to get my weight off i'm about fifty pounds overweight and so i'd like to get the weight off and then i'd really like to get into that and uh we have a my husband and i have a a aerobic video that's called The Firm i don't know if you've heard of it but it's a an aerobic video with not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down but you're using weights and that is the most incredible aerobic workout i have ever done it is r[eally]- it's really fun yes uh-huh uh-huh yes um no i mean yes i am but i have never done it myself have you done that oh that's the big thing huh oh so how is that ooh oh uh-huh yeah huh now if um playing basketball are you knees do you have healthy knees oh dear uh-huh um-hum that's good well that sounds you sound just like my he he he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball and oh he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy an[d]- so that's what he does he wears his his brace and his high tops and oh uh oh shoot wow uh-huh oh dear oh it is amazing how fast you take off the inches and i would once i start my forty i'd like to do the forty five minutes a day on the bike for a week and then every other day i'd like to incorporate the video um and then the bike on the other day but it is really amazing how fast the inches come off and the muscle builds real fast um you can start they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your uh twenty five pound dumbbells and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video and it's a hour long video so it is yeah i really enjoy that so i'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy yes yes now this one has been quite mild um we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground it was quite chilly but not	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh do you have any recycling going on in your community uh-huh uh-huh so they used to pick this stuff up but just throw it away but oh really it's my impression that uh it's rare to find someone who will recycle magazines the glossy magazines yes uh and then they charge you for the service uh-huh was this something that was voted on or uh hum by the City Council or something uh-huh uh-huh um they'd charge for it whether you take advantage of it or not uh-huh uh-huh um-hum right well we have uh some volunteer run recycling in some towns near here uh in our own neighborhood there's a private company that comes around once a week and uh picks up recyclables they do not pick up magazines uh and i believe they don't pick up the plastic i think it's the two categories you talked about it's just newspapers bottles cans and uh cardboard and it used to be free for a few weeks then they sent out little flyers saying hey we still want to do this for free but we're not quite making ends meet and we'll take donations and i i'm i don't not sure if anybody really sent donations in to this private company just to be nice and i believe they're going to start charging now uh and i i'm not sure what we're going to do i mean it definitely diminishes the amount of trash we have to put out so it may work out monetarily okay for us to be charged for it uh and since they are private if they charge too much they'll people will just start throwing it in the trash right we pay for our trash pickup but this isn't the trash people this is another this is uh um Carl Carl's recycling and uh he comes around with a truck of his own so it's completely uh private and nonmandatory and people just put things out on the curb um he's competing with some uh very small scale people who go around with shopping carts about an hour before his truck comes and try to get the most valuable recyclables so it's uh um-hum yes yes i've heard that that yeah it's uh they have all this used newsprint that people don't want right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh you are you're you're into uh recycling um-hum what materials do you recycle um-hum um-hum so so you're trying to take action to have that changed um-hum right so economically it's not a situation where you're going be able to attract a lot of attention right um-hum well i think um that is kind of becoming one of the drivers now the fact that with all the recycling that took place the price per pound has declined i know aluminum in our area one year ago aluminum was forty five cents a pound and now it's twenty last time i went it was twenty two cents a pound so it uh there's not a lot of money to be made but it's just a question of trying to help the environment um-hum right hm yeah where where i work we recycle paper that's about it yeah any any um non[colored]- noncolored or {nonfilm} type paper just white paper and that sort of thing and uh oh we don't use that kind of paper any more no we have perforated for personal printers and then like LaserJet type paper we don't use the green bar type paper any more right um-hum well i would guess that your church is probably at a point where they're not really breaking even on their recycling i mean unless they get volunteers who have people who have trucks and that sort of thing um-hum um-hum right well there are neighborhoods in the Atlanta area where uh you have specific trash bins to put recyclables in and then they're collected on a regular basis right right right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
well my parents were both in them_1 and my father-in-law and it's a tough decision to make because boy it really confines the uh the people and uh usually they don't care for it and kind of put you on a guilt trip but uh have you had any experience with them_1 yeah yeah but it's still still not like home right yeah but uh you know and it's hard to really know what kind of a home is run unless you really know someone that's in there and you have to kind of take that with a grain of salt too that uh yeah they may say it's real bad uh just because they don't like it in there whereas it's you know usually pretty good uh uh the one my father-in-law was in had uh oh God entertainment every afternoon of some you know bingo or cards or whatever yeah and uh and it's easy to check out the meals you know just go up there during uh meal time if you can stand it because they don't eat that too well and uh go uh a[lways]- you always have to check it for cleanliness too well you have to make sure they're clean and they just had a incident in uh Dallas here where the guy's suing the nursing home he came in at ten in the morning check on his mom and she was sick and uh went up to the front desk and said what's wrong with my mom and they said wha[t]- is she sick we didn't know that and here she died two hours later yeah so you know and w[ell]- there's an awful lot of variables in them_1 oh well i think Medicare and Medicaid payments are uh kind of tightening up on it but uh you know in some of them_1 some of them_1 try so d[arn]- hard but caring for an elderly person who might be forgetful is ever ending well it's around the clock care yeah an awful lot and and gentleness too yeah costs a bunch my mother-in-law is uh eighty two and we'd probably put her in the same home that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well how do you feel about trial by jury in what way i mean do you do you feel they're they're swayed more to[ward]- are you talking about with criminal or civil suits um-hum so you think that i mean that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry um-hum the other thing the other thing that really bothers me about that is i think you know that a judge can be uh i like the idea of juries uh of your peers um in that you you you you you get more first of all you get more than one person making the de[cision]- making a decision and second of all you get a wide variety of background so that um-hum i'd agree that that's that's definitely a problem um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah i i guess i- i- definitely agree with you but sen[tencing]- the well what i don't like about uh sen[tencing]- juries doing the sentencing in that i think it becomes a lot less th[e]- th[e]- the the same crime gets unequal sentences i uh i- i think there is more of an ability of you know you know s[electing]- s[electing]- selecting a jury two two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent but i think i think that there'd that there'd be a large variation in in trying to gauge the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and and have that that measure stick across the board um-hum um-hum um-hum of course a lot of that's also the the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer um-hum um-hum yeah i agree um-hum um-hum oh yeah i- i agree with it yeah they and they'll admit to you that they cann[ot]- they don't have the benefit of being able to you know of of of letting allowing themselves to believe their c[lient]- client innocent or guilty it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument that the um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah uh yeah this is a little bit of the subject but one one thing that i that i really dislike uh also that's that's new is the uh is that i have heard that there are federal sentences	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay well how do you feel about uh drug testing uh for prospective employees uh-huh oh i see oh twenty four hour people you mean uh-huh uh-huh um-hum um-hum uh-huh would you uh would you do it before they were employed or would would you say random testing is also okay yeah um-hum yeah it's a hard problem isn't it because because you don't want an airline pilot on drugs but at the same time that's a that's a that's an embarrassing humiliating kind of test to have to take people questioning you by you know by doing that yeah yeah and we're and we're getting it does feel like it doesn't it i know well it is because when we think about it and it isn't at all reassuring doctors have been on drugs for years from what i hear you know and and uh we've uh and we have all sorts of people who've done things and i'm certainly not in favor of of any of that and yet somehow they've performed and then they say well if i did what i was suppose to do and did it the way i was suppose to do it then why would you you know whose business is it right and yet the potential like i don't like knowing that there might be an alcoholic who is flying my plane or or you know cutting into my body uh-huh that's right that's right it's o[nly]- o[nly]- only old lady so and so from where ever and yeah it and it does it does make you wonder because i'm not su[re]- i was trying to think in in history ha[ve]- have people checked that or did people just did people just accept the responsibility or are we able to test things now that never could be tested before so therefore we're using technology in a way that wasn't available before um-hum um-hum right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay well uh i guess since i called i'll start out with my feelings about it uh i think that it's absolutely essential that some so[me]- at least some employees of government agencies and companies be tested especially when it effects public safety i mean the military obviously uh people that run trains and airplanes and and the like uh for others i don't know i don't feel as strong about it uh i don't really don't have any objection to it but i can't really say i'm for it either what's your feeling uh-huh yeah right or Northwest i think Northwest has had a lot of problems with that i uh i've been in uh two two situations where i've had to under go test[ing]- drug testing i was in the military for a number of years and then i worked for four years uh as a as a an electrical inspector uh in a nuclear plant that was under construction and in both cases uh you know we were subject to uh to random testing for drugs and i know a lot of people refused to a lot especially at the nuclear plant or would uh you know strongly object to it but uh you know i could see the need for it so i i went along with it i i think if i were a clerical worker for instance though uh and really couldn't have effected anybody else i'm not sure that i'd um-hum um-hum uh-huh uh-huh right um um-hum uh-huh right right probably alcohol has more of an effect for for a shorter period of time uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh um-hum so they were doing it just to they wanted to make sure that their employees were productive probably that's wh[y]- that's probably why they justified it no i'm just trying to imagine why they would wanna test you right right yeah i i think that people who do something that could hurt somebody else uh should be subject to the testing i guess that's probably the the way i'd term it and i'm talking about bus drivers as you mentioned and pilots and what have you uh others that really can only hurt themselves shall we say uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah they do do random drug testing i i work in the defense industry and so they're they're they're pretty concerned about something like that although in my mind i don't i don't like the idea of having a having like a hit squad come in and suddenly like you know put my employment on the line over uh my lifestyle choices consi[dered]- i i don't think considering i don't think it affects my job and like nobody um nobody's life is at at risk i don't think they should really care what i do in my spare time i think i'm not i'm not really sure i think that they're worried that you might uh if if if you're a drug addict you could probably compromise government secrets or something like that but i i think it's a pretty conservative approach to you know uh uh things i think it's like a fifties approach to a to a an an eighties or nineties lifestyle you know i- i don't know i think drugs are pretty pervasive in our society and yeah well also i what i think is a a problem is that there's a there's a lot of things out there that will actually ma[ke]- let you test positive for drugs when you're you're not even like not even on drugs right i did you see that thing on uh 60 Minutes about the uh the Air Force pilot who um they there was a mistake at the lab and oh it was on in 60 Minutes there was a mistake at the lab and he he tested he was a B fifty two bomber pilot and he he tested positive and he it ruined his career he he uh he was drummed out of the Air Force and he spent i think something like seven years working you know before he was able to work his way back through the the courts to be uh you know i guess it's called exonerated but by then his career is was was ruined because yeah he's he he was seven years and it was just like it it was a an accident and uh-huh yeah oh you know but i but i also uh you know you read things about uh like train car conductors uh which you think of the well no i'm talking about like the guy no i'm i'm talking about the the engineers now that that is pretty scary though uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah right yeah but then again uh you know i also if i was a conductor i- i i wouldn't want i wouldn't want to have to like you know piss in a little paper cup whenever you know um-hum uh-huh yeah by then i had just had a thought about like what about a what about a police officer you know i mean that then you begin to to wonder if i understand they have like random law enforcement officers have to go through through random random tests just to see i guess like what side of the law they are they're on you know and and i'm beginning to i'm i'm i'm starting to think a little more a little more about this is that i guess should we really be talking about what should we be should we have legalized drugs you know yeah i i think that uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
oh i guess i started it bust away oh um New York yeah uh-huh yeah well yeah i know i pay too much yeah i know i pay too much the reason i know this for a fact is because um the nature of my business is such that my income fluctuates dramatically from year to year so on the good years i pay just propor[tional]- i'm i'm viewed as wealthy and i pay a high percentage and on the bad years i'm not and i pay average so i either pay average or above average i don't pay below average yeah yeah i'm a consultant you know so due to the nature of the business it um you know my base line is average and i don't get that back on the other half back there was that went away a few years ago and uh you know whatev[er]- you call it i suspect that was one of those loop holes for the wealthy they closed but uh i don't know for sure um well i didn't say value um i'm just saying that proportionally i pay this portion in a large amount uh no not at the moment not at um yeah yeah yeah well that's yeah if you're unfortunate enough not to buy a house which if your life style doesn't make it desirable yeah yeah yeah well unless you're up in the uh mega bucks range but um yeah yeah as far as whether you get value back for your dollar i think the answer to that one if if you wonder the through state of through uh Washington DC awful lot of big fancy buildings there they got paid by something you know so uh you know what's going in -[ha]s got to be a lot more -[th]an going out if it can pay for all that stuff well i'm not really talking about um who is putting it in i'm just saying that what goes in must be a lot more than what comes out if there is left over for all these things in the middle yeah that's what i meant what's that well you know it's just uh you know pass a law print up ano[ther]- billion and uh business as i'm not too familiar with that expression regressive versus what does that mean yeah right um-hum well that's the theory um um-hum yeah yeah well they play that game here in New York but um it worki[ng]- it winds up working in very strange ways you can go to the grocery store and there's a sales tax now which is supposedly is only for necessities i'm sorry on[ly]- not for necessities only for non essentials and if you buy your orange juice in a paper container it's not taxed but if you buy it in a can uh concentrated then it is taxed so um i don't claim to understand that you know that's um and uh you know then we get into the idea of trying to modify behavior by taxing you know cranking the taxes for cigarettes and hope people -[w]ill stop yeah but you know we liquor yeah thing is you know you got to l[ook]- all all you got to do is take one look at the uh cocaine situation to realize that cranking the price up is not going to stop people hm hm right really yeah you know i um we get a tax here that um what do you call it uh	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh actually it turns out to be an interesting topic because i'm now in the middle of a job search graduating here and realizing that one of the things that's not really well represented in benefits often is flexibility because my wife will have some set of benefits where ever she's working and the ability to mix and match in a useful way particularly with things like medical and dental it's something that i've been uh looking for that's amusing yeah yeah i think we have a similar thing in California and i think that at the moment you can't issue health insurance that doesn't have coverage for substance abuse and certain other mental health issues and and the result is a lot of people won't provide it at all or over charge yeah yeah the other things they do seem to be willing to spend money in strange ways for instance i know where my wife works she can get for something like five or ten dollars a month sole health insurance but it would cost her an additional sixty or seventy a month to include me on that policy well assuming that we both work at places that feel this way we may very well miss out on the convenience of going to the same place because those two places will never get together and agree okay one of them_1 will pay for all of the uh the dental and optical and the other one'll pay for the medical instead it's it's very much designed towards self only insurance i don't know if all employers are that way but a lot of them i have seen are yeah well that's pretty good that's something this university at at least the graduate student negotiated plan was very bad about this idea of low cost alternatives i know in one case there were doctors around who were affiliated with the university who you can go see and all your lab work is covered under their research so in fact you're saving them you know hundreds of dollars in in billings by going to a research uh physician yet at the same time they will only pay based on eighty percent of the customary reasonable charges for the physicians visits and won't take into account the fact that by seeing that doctor you're saving them you know a couple of hundred dollars over going to somebody else and a lot of things like that um one thing i was wondering is something i've noticed that that they don't publicize much but a lot of companies in particularly organizations school and government organizations have is legal uh services of some sort hm yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
so how you like New Jersey right i guess uh i don't know what part of New Jersey you're in but i guess it's uh fairly industrial right uh-huh yeah yeah right right well i don't know about you but i've always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor i mean there's a lot of contributors but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that yeah that's yeah that's that's a big issue is you know a lot of states don't have a uh inspection law so you get you get a lot of people out there without ETR emission control systems on their cars and things like that yeah and it's like sure right i guess from what i hear though uh next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars they're actually coming out with the first prototypes in California yeah right i hope i i'm hoping that comes along quick uh i was reading a an article in Time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going and i guess it's it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize and i know that's not due to uh it's not due to to gasoline or to you know carbon monoxide so much as the CFC's but uh yeah i think that's a that's a contributor definitely right right yeah i guess right now what they're what they're primarily worried about is third world countries because i guess United States and and Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating CFC production but it go ahead um-hum right and that's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using is that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes if if that makes any sense uh in terms of exactly exactly uh those of kind of yeah those are joining arguments but uh i don't know that's that's kind of an interesting situation there uh what they don't realize those third world countries what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting i guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the poles and it's it's increasing even as far near the Equator as like Florida and Cuba and those places so it's kind of an interesting situation it's not not a real good one actually but yeah uh-huh yeah yeah you don't get that that source of cleansing anymore are have you been in big cities a long time okay so you've got yeah those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard i would think yeah Denver's definitely yeah that's one of the worst sure yeah Denver's that that real good uh that real good uh example of sitting in a valley kind of like Mexico City does i guess Mexico City is historically been one of the worst in the in in the world for that but i've been pretty lucky i've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem although uh i'm really kind of based in Orlando Florida and there you can tell that it's getting worse i mean it it definitely it's not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver but you can exactly yeah and there's not that much in terms of of public transportation down there there is but it's kind of it's	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so you don't oh uh random drug testing is kind of tough because it it involves this kind of uh trading off of of our individual civil rights for some kind of concept of uh furthering a common good almost you know there there's a there's a there's a trade off of our civil rights against i guess our employer's right to to having a good job or something um-hum yeah uh well tha[t's]- that's a good point the only uh the only thing i really disagree with is and and this isn't this isn't exactly disagreement wi[th]- i'm not sure that drug testing is strictly aimed to catch people but i would think that it also acts as a deterrent if someone if someone knows that there's a threat that that they might get caught it might be that much more of an impetus to to stay away from from whatever the drug is they're they're on well i mean i would think that uh if someone knows that there's there's an even greater chance that they['re]- they're going to get caught um having drugs that that tha[t]- that would act to discourage them that it would um you know if you know dad's in the other room perhaps you're going to be less likely to steal the the cookies out of the cookie jar because_1 he might be coming in any minute you know um-hum well the the uh the mayor of Baltimore is a Rhodes Scholar and i i forget his name but one thing that he suggested doing was taking the money taking all the money that he gets for uh uh fighting the war on drugs and use it for like drug education to to open up the methadone programs to get the people off drugs that that wanna be off drugs um in thinking that that it's we're not doing a good job at fighting the war you know in in trying to crack down on people that are using drugs maybe legalizing them and and trying to help those that you know having the resources there to help someone um would be a better idea but and and i agreed with him somewhat i could see his point but uh Switzerland opened up a um uh a park and and for years it just kept getting worse more and more people kept coming to the park and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse until finally the Swiss have they decided to close it down so uh i don't know it mean it sounds like it sounds like there aren't going to that there isn't a perfect solution that's a good point that's a good point and although although alcohol consumption did jump right after prohibition it did come back down yes we do we do	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
well that's a project uh-huh well we do a lot of our own repair just we enjoy doing it and kind of like you though it's finding the time to do it but oh things like uh the inside of the house i always do the i[t]- all the painting in it and uh in fact come think of it we did the outside the trim of the house and that turned out to be quite a job since we have a two story house and uh well not really we added a room upstairs or finished off a room upstairs but that was a that turned out to be quite a job too it was a game room and uh it took us a long time i mean i'm talking about a year to finish that uh-huh um-hum uh-huh the fitting i think is what is took us so long you know the measurement and fitting it trying it taking it down fitting it again that um uh so we have recently built on a a extra garage to our house and uh we had a lot of uh well we had the concrete and stuff poured first we didn't attempt that we talked about it but decided that was gonna be a bit much and uh but we did all the finishing out on it and my husband has a workshop in it or uh he races cars and we needed a spare garage there and that turned out to be quite a project uh we're looking at uh a lot of small things to do around the house now like uh i think we are on borrowed time on things like the hot water heater it's that we're gonna change out our self that uh i've learned to do some plumbing well we do because uh we've had one fail and it was quite a mess for us that yes and so uh we can tell that it's going out because of the we're running out of hot water and stuff we'll have some it's an electric heater and uh we figure some of the burners or heated elements are going out and we priced them and kind of felt like it be just as cheap for us to go on and change it out and and be done with it than this waiting for it to flood us and like it did before and uh and you can get them_1 at discount stores fairly cheap and uh we can do it ours[elves]- it's not that much trouble just unscrewing a few pipes and screwing back some more uh-huh um-hum well it is time consuming oh um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
so uh whe[re]- where do you -[g]et your current events okay uh-huh um do you watch any television oh uh-huh huh uh-huh uh-huh well um i used to read the whole paper every day and uh when you when i did that i really knew stuff you know i mean if you read the whole paper every day you walk into work and you're like you want to talk to people about so what do you think about the situation in West Pakistan like this the parliamentary government's not g[oing]- not you know not going to stay in there and people sort of stare at you uh but now i have a child and i i read the comics every day um and i sort of glance at the front page uh i also used to listen to um public radio tried to listen to that every evening for the news and every morning and when i when i was doing that and reading the paper i really i really felt informed uh especially having the two different viewpoints uh slightly different anyway uh now i listen to the radio maybe five minutes in the morning and i don't get to listen evening some i'm pretty pretty uninformed uh but those were my two big ones the newspaper and the radio uh uh-huh yeah oh that was the other thing i used to drive to work i used to have a long commute and i would listen to every morning on uh public radio there's a show called Morning Edition that lasts an hour and a half and they repeat the main headlines every half-hour so i would listen to two segments of that and you know really really know stuff and now that i'm just walking and riding the bus um i i miss that uh the uh the well during the during the Gulf War we turned on the TV a couple times did you wa[tch]- watch any more during that yeah the whole Iraq thing uh-huh um-hum um-hum oh yeah i'll bet oh yeah you probably learned a lot from them yeah yeah yeah there's so much to know it is amazing um well uh one thing that was interesting during that whole thing was i would listen to the radio quite a bit and uh you know i started bringing a radio to work and i would listen a little bit at work and listen on the way home and on the way the way there and uh i really felt like i was keeping up pretty well and then i would watch CNN for you know fifteen minutes or a half hour and see a bunch of pictures and realize i hadn't really learned anything you know they sort of show planes taking off and uh like i i got more visual information but less real information in a way uh-huh yeah and it's almost as though that was stuff was more available to TV so they used it you know they have to show something and that's all they could show on TV they could i mean on the radio they would bring in all sorts of you know experts from God knows where and interview them and talk to them about it and speculate uh i think in part at least because they had to uh which is kind of interesting so i just found that they the information per hour was much higher on the radio although the TV was a little more compelling ri[ght]- it's it's an interesting question about you know the bandwidth of the telev[ision]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so what kind of animals do you have uh uh-huh yeah i have a dog and a cat so oh yeah they it was uh a very hairy two weeks there at the beginning uh the dog was a little under a year and the cat was about six weeks old and it it was a hefty break in well it was very it was interesting because it it's just you know part of their makeup they're psyche i mean they just hate each other automatically but after a while they they got to be good friends and uh luckily it's sort of a big cat i mean it's about twelve pounds and uh so he can hold his own against the dog and uh but they they i basically got the cat to keep the dog company and uh they they do that uh-huh yeah well i'll tell you one thing i found with with pets um i- i think cats are easier to take care of especially when on a situation like you go off on a trip uh you know it's a real pain with a dog because you have to have someone come over and walk them and let them out and that kind of thing and sometimes i think wow if i had two cats i'd just you know get a feeder and oh that's amazing yeah that is interesting i hadn't ever heard anything like that but uh yeah we've been uh we've been pretty lucky too the uh reason we first got the dog to begin with was i lived i'm in school still and i lived uh closer to campus and uh as usual the neighborhoods right near campus aren't that nice and uh so we got the dog as protection and i guess it worked because we were never broken into and th[e]- but the people on either side of us were so yeah uh yeah yeah uh she's uh around fifty pounds she's a a very very skinny shepherd uh well she's not pure and w[e]- we tried to figure out what she was crossed with we know the mother was a shepherd but uh she looks like she's crossed with like Greyhound because she is just thin as a rail and uh yeah definitely and they're also prone to more diseases and uh skin problems and my sister has a a pure bred gold uh yellow Lab and that dog has every you could imagine you know it's allergic to fleas it's uh got another skin condition and just yeah yeah so w[e]- we haven't really had much problems with her she's uh just extremely hyper and uh i guess that accounts for her her physique and she runs like a gazelle so it's fun to take her to the park and watch her run rings around all the other dogs trying to play with them and they look at her like you're crazy you think i'm going to catch you so yeah yeah either right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so is your tax situation pretty straightforward or not straightforward at all um-hum oh that's nice right um-hum right i don't have any problem at all with income tax some of the property taxes are well i don't know if they're unfair they're confusing and i there seems to be less ability to get those all together um-hum um-hum really right you just bought it right right really they didn't raise the they c[anceled]- your neighbors' taxes that's really great that's wonderful right um-hum right right and you just bought yours that's the best argument i think that's wonderful i bet um-hum oh it was a it was a really wow it wasn't it wasn't the county council um-hum um-hum right well he di[d]- he probably knows it really well the real estate market so that was probably help uh-huh right right now it is right oh you got audited wow	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh well anyway i uh i uh oh i- i did forget to ask you what is your name by the way oh you're Ann hi but um anyway i uh lot of lot of s[tuff]- interesting procedural things i think we could we could change if we're going to talking about the subject to[night]- tonight which is some i guess criminal courts the yeah the the one of which was uh something something that's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town and that is uh and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race uh ye[ah]- yeah well the the uh the the people that the the the uh the jury that's trying uh the officers in that case is is an all white panel and there's been a lot made in the local papers of that fact they have they have they moved it up to the county north of here um it's in Ventura and there's there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously and it's kind of it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that uh that yeah it was everywhere so you know and i- i think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on exactly you know um the you know i i'm kind of torn on this issue it's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true but on the other hand is it's also saying that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict uh you know they're not going to do their job which is the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there's enough i um they well i guess it depends on who you talk to i haven't talked to uh i haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but i- i rather imagine there's there's some snickering about it and a lot of the usually fatalistic oh here we go again folks kind of stuff no no i you know on on on one hand y[ou]- on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's th[ey]- they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy um um-hum well yeah um i don't know you know and and again there's something else th[at]- you know there was a uh i[t]- something else along those lines there was a girl out here named Latausha Harlins i don't know if this this got this got as much notoriety but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was as it was with uh the Rodney King problem um girl walked into a Korean owned store and uh they she had a dispute black girl she she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the with the owner of the store the owner of the store popped her yeah and and well of course the you know the criminal case went up and and the judge gave the woman who shot her shot the girl a uh uh practically a suspended sentence i mean it was it was just she gave her no time in jail and and you know all of these things and then oh there's uh we have these we have people wandering around to with petitions trying to get the judge yeah yeah yeah it would make it would make life easier yeah but um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

so do you keep a family budget that's a good way to do it what what we usually do my wife and i fortunately she likes to keep the numbers and i- i don't um so what what happens is uh i make the money and she spends it but she spends it carefully and then at the end of the month she just tallies it up and uh we have basically categories spend this much in this area this much in that area and uh although i don't keep that in mind as we spend we do um kind of get to the end of the month and see how we did and uh you know at the beginning of the month too we also take out some some savings and put them aside so we we know we don't have that to spend that appears to work pretty well um-hum do you have a uh specialized program or do you or do you just use something like a spreadsheet we've got uh a couple of those but uh i've been trying to ge[t]- get my wife sold on a spreadsheet and have her uh doing it that way and she prefers still just to do it by hand um she says as long as she's dealing with the numbers and it's just adding them up and then subtracting from the the target totals she says it's just as quick to do that way as to to uh enter it on the computer and have it check the arithmetic so w[ell]- that's kind of the way i feel and uh i use spreadsheets a lot and a lot more than she does so i feel like she's you know if if she did do it for a couple months she'd probably like it but she was just that um our as far as our family budget goes yeah what we do is we kind of know what what we're making and we've been doing keeping track long enough that we know what we need to spend and pretty much all the difference goes uh well it goes into two or three different places what have what we call an education account where we put aside some money for each of our children every month with the desperate fear that by the time they are old enough to use it it's not going to be enough anyway and uh then we have kind of just a savings account and and right now all we've been doing is taking that and and putting it away in a money market account we haven't been investing or anything like that uh yet we just moved last year into a home just last week bought a car and so we have some kind of substantial other commitments to take care of right now but we uh you know we even with all that we're still able to put some aside how about you well it's it's nice to have something you know people say that if you're if you're not saving money you're spending more than you earn and uh that's probably the case you know you never can live down to the last dime so you're either coming out ahead or coming out behind	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well i think um for at least for me uh because_1 my sister is looking for day care one of the things that we talked about as being very important is the um the in the teacher to uh the number of kids because if you've got a lo[t]- a large number of children one teacher just won't cut it right right um-hum right word of mouth is good uh something that i don't think many people know about and i this is just something i've heard not something i've actually e[xperienced]- um checked into is that um the agency that uh that license um a[gencies]- agencies to care for kids like ho[me]- either home or day care you can you can request to see if they have had any problems in the past is what i've been told that would be a good a good resource to check um-hum um-hum yeah oh yeah oh yeah yes and in and there's some places i'm sorry go ahead right because then there's some places and i w[ould]- and i would don't this would be a a big minus for the places there are some places that state that you cannot come in unannounced you have to have an appointment or you know or whatever and i don't think you know if there hum-um no no never yes and i think you've also got to loo[k]- you know whenever you go in and you know talk to the talk to the the the teachers and look at the toys that they have and the environment that the kids'll be in yes um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah no um i like i said my sister's in the process of trying to find one for hers um-hum right right an[d]- and that's a good situation but it can it can it can turn bad with older children um i was in a day care until i was thirteen just during like in the summers and what we found was and what finally got me out of this women's home was the fact that she would go off shopping with some of the older kids and leave me there to care for the little ones you know and i mean this went on for a su[mmer]- for a you know good two and a half months you know and it's her daily thing you know and so if you've got older children that you just don't want to leave at home sometimes a day c[are]- a a a private home or a day care setting is not the best right right so but oh and another one is is how they discipline um i know depending a couple of the day cares that that i went to whenever i was younger um one of them_1 disciplined whenever we were outside you hugged a tree and you had time out whereas you know i've heard of some agencies you know that get into the physical discipline and you you really have to find a discipline that that matches your beliefs or yeah right because it gets it can it can become very confusing for the child so oh yeah hm what about um well i'm in i'm in nursing so one thing i would look at would be um the cleanliness and the care the hea[lth]- that's right the certification of the of the t[eachers]- teachers because there's a new state law mandating that everyone that works in a day care knows knows infant and child CPR but there's a lot of places	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
it seems to me that the the benefits of working for a big company tend to be the the same things that that are to their determent um they aren't as as responsive both to like bad economic times you don't have to worry about your job all of a sudden disappearing but when you see a job when you see a a job that needs to be done sometimes you have to fill out the five forms in triplicate in order to to get it done you know what i mean oh wow right there is that i mean well and then i guess again i- i gue[ss]- like i said when i when i started off that the advantages tend to be the same things that the disadvantages i mean if i don't show up for for work there's probably somebody else that could fill my spot but um i imagine and and that's nice but uh it's w[ould]- it's also nice to be able to uh know that that you are the person that that makes things get done you know if if you're not there it doesn't happen yeah oh wow oh wow um-hum you know one other benefit that tha[t]- just occurred to me i didn't take it as much advantage of it at least not yet in sometimes big companies will pay for like education i had some friends of mine uh get sent up to Stanford for a year for uh college or for like for grad school and i guess getting stuck in California for the summer is is not such a bad thing you know but uh uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah yeah but i would think that a a smaller company you would have a i mean if if if a small company hits some niche in the some niche market that that it is uniquely qualified to um take care of it has a chance to to grow really fast and if you can get on top of it before before it goes up i mean you know if all of a sudden the company expanded to like you know three thousand people you would probably be one of the top people of course i guess if there's only the two of you you'll i mean i guess y[ou're]- you're one of the top two people but you are also in the bottom half so so uh um the only other thing i can think of is uh uh stuff for things like uh like if if there's some kind of child care if if someone were married and had kids bigger companies might have something like that and uh um like like it's their i guess another advantage might be that uh if th[ey]- if it's big a big enough company and it has multiple sites um if you wanted to you could stay with the same company and decide you wanted to live in another part of the country which i guess i being with a small company you wouldn't get forced to move but do you think uh do you think it was good to to move around or not oh you had family in San Antonio oh okay see i'm trying to decide my dad was in the military which is i guess if you figure companies the military would be a pretty big company a number of people but uh although it's getting smaller every every day um and we moved like oh man we used to move like every every three years at least and like i don't know i mean there's well there's i i've kept in touch with some people from college but but i don't i mean i don't really know i ca[n't]- i wouldn't i couldn't	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
all right um well basically i think we uh probably pay more out in taxes than we should uh we don't see the sort of feedback that we need from it um i think the government waste a lot of the money um and spends it on purposes that that the government really shouldn't be spending it on um i don't think that it's effectively used so um-hum right yeah i think i think um-hum right right exactly exactly i mean it they keep on thinking that you know it's okay to borrow against the future indefinitely um and they don't realize that once they create these programs y[ou]- well they have such a hard time killing off a program yeah once once it starts receiving funding it its like uh yanking wisdom teeth to try and get it uh killed you know even when and you know i don't know a lot of the things i think the federal government does uh it does very poorly um i'm kind of a state's right person and i think that a lot of of what the federal government could do could be handled uh more efficiently uh on a state level uh you know state to state because the states i think have a better idea of where where they need to spend the money for the kind of population that they have um and i think the federal government is just too far removed from the the specific situation um you know i mean there there are some things that our taxes need to be spent on um at a federal level like national uh defense and uh you know common rule making and things like that um but i think a lot of it could be handed over to the states you know especially things like welfare and and you know food stamps that kind of programs um so um yes and no um a lot of it you know the states get like matching funds or you know they they get a certain amount of funds that they get to do with as they please but um why you know why doesn't the state take in the revenue directly then you know uh kind of eliminating some of those bureaucracy that goes on um-hum yes oh yeah i agree exactly um um-hum oh yeah yeah i well i think we're seeing a major decline um but um i'm i'm not sure how that relates directly to taxation um uh trying to stay on the topic here right yeah hum um-hum right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
yeah i- i agree with you there the metric system is very good i'm um i'm um do drafting i'm i'm a engineer and i've done drawing and and have to do calculation of fluid mechanics and thing and if you ever have to try to do four different conversions to to to try and all four different type of system with gravitational constant and it it just goes it just goes on and on -[a]nother th[ing]- thing is that when doing your drawing you can scale them_1 so much easier thing because their increment of ten's so much easier i mean your your life is just uh so much easier i i really think that what can be done differently is that it's it's to ingrain in our society to shift it all our prototype all our our mode our template our bolts our threads everything the tooling the tooling is is so is so uh in in our system that it just it it just going to take a lot to move it away well most of them_1 have the matrix set now but it's it's it's uh i think it's more in the the the the bolts and threads and stuff it self i mean the the screw machine and stuff that makes all those thing they're just they cost millions of you know thou[sand]- hundred of thousand's of dollars and thing and that's and i guess maybe they could be re[sented]- some of them_1 could be resented but the comp[any]- the business community just doesn't want to do that i think what really needs to be done is that they need to be educated that in the long run their life is going to be so much easier oh exactly also the trade you're you're exactly right yeah it's uh we need to do that and uh as i said the the main thing you know like just in the calculation th[e]- th[e]- exactly in what oh okay i know what that is yeah yeah it's it's you know and then that each individual company has their own set of guidelines they they they use but we our our society in the United State in the global in in the world and the economic seem that nobody really wants to be compatible with everybody else we started out with the computers and we've we've had to fight tooth and nail just to get them_1 to be some what compatible and they're all just going off and all dif[ferent]- all these different directions and i guess one of the problem is is that the goal isn't to pro[duce]- pro[duce]- -[pro]duce the technology the goal is to produce the buck the the all mighty dollar is so powerful that it just it it just control our destiny um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah well i guess so you just yeah i guess that's that's true i really like first thought i can't really think of what the different would be the different has to do with uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh i got both yep it's uh half Border Collie and half Lab half Border Collie yeah yep it's it's uh and you'd think he's an uh little poodle he's about eighty pounds though yeah yeah yep yeah oh yeah they get along real good oh the dog was brought up with cats so he doesn't really bother the cats well now the little kitten picks on him all the time yep uh let's see uh about seven eight years old and and our cat's only about_1 two years old well uh we bo[th]- we've had cats and dogs before you know before we even got married so i kind of like cats and she likes dogs so yep so we've had them_1 oh at one time we had two dogs and two cats but oh yeah well ours does that the company when we get it yep yep uh oh yeah he he's pretty he's real friendly but but when somebody knocks at the door he's his barks is real uh you know like he's a real bad dog but uh when you come in the house and he he'd probably show the burglars where everything was at oh yeah i've heard that too um-hum yeah i kn[ow]- i think it helps them_1 too when they take them_1 out for walks and stuff especially dogs you know plus they're uh the dog's a good good uh way to protect your house too when you're gone you know like i said he barks a lot when somebody r[ings]- knocks on the door or rings the doorbell so it kind of keeps people away they think twice about breaking in uh but our little our little kitty he she uses uh she's pretty cute little the wife got her when she she was a stray and uh it bit her and so she had to bring it home with her to see if she got rabies or anything yep so oh yeah well that's basically how she got the dog too w[ell]- well not really we uh the dog's name is Morgan and the cat's name is Oscar Anne yeah we[ll]- well see at first they thought that the cat was a a boy so they called her Oscar until the found out she was a girl so they just called her Oscar Anne so that's uh that's the name there and uh how we got the dogs was we were stationed in England and she went to some we had a dog and she took it to dog obedience school and this farmer was gonna kill these six puppies they had and she kind of said well i'll kind of i'll take one of them_1 off your hands and that's how we got Morgan i think uh well i didn't really come up with the name she did so uh-huh	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so uh what do you wear to work all right yeah well that's good where do you work NTSC huh i used to work in that building right right before i worked at Honeywell i worked at ARI which is on the PM trade side all right imagine -[there]'s all kinds of uh coincidences here um yeah that's that's a pretty good environment actually when i worked for ARI they made me wear uh well they didn't make make wear anything but they prefer that i wore something almost {tieish} right right okay all right what kind of research do you do Kyle get out are you kidding me i'm uh i'm working with flight controls and displays up here at Honeywell um in fact my dissertation will involve uh auditory warnings eye cast things like that so uh yeah it's amazing um no up here at Honeywell we generally it's real real laid back in terms of dress uh most people have never seen a tie i think unless they're meeting with a with a customer yeah and oh you were up at oh that's right you said you'd spend some time up here at Hon[eywell]- do you remember which department or which branch you were at probably not huh okay yeah i'm not real sure about that i've only been up here a little while so i'm still kind of getting the hang of it but actually i'll be back down in May to finish my degree so uh that'll be good do you have much connection with the human factors people down there yeah all right great well i'll probably be using i hope when i get back give me a good vehicle to do my dissertation on maybe but uh yeah actually that it's and all those people oh okay right great but uh no aside from that i don't think i've worn a tie more than about once here and that's uh yes they kind of had to twist my arm to do that because_1 i really wasn't meeting with a customer but you know how that works but uh well yeah it sounds like you got all holes over the place now the guys that the guys that i'm working with here the guy that i work directly with uh in my office he usually comes in in real ripped jeans he's pretty uh real casual in fact almost too casual plus uh yeah i was kind of surprised to see that actually and uh so uh where else did you work before that yeah all right you like it yeah i i liked it too it it's kind of weird that that environment is is different than a lot of other environments just because you're in in a little maze of cubicles you know and it's kind of it's just yeah it is in a way and presumably that's supposed to be the paycheck right but who's to say yeah no kidding but uh now that the whole idea of them pumping white noise over the speakers to mask out the telephones and things like that it's kind of interesting yeah so they're actually kind of thinking it through huh right well that's that's the important part for them_1 but uh so what do you uh do you think you're going to stick around there for a while or do think yeah yeah i've actually i'm actually kind of looking for work when i get back	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well for myself it's the printed media um only on occasion do i i watch the television for any news because by that time it's so glossed over it's not even funny um the radio i've yet to find so true so true yeah that's right you know details at eleven while the earth is cracking in half you know um but myself i go for the printed media and well one one new show which i do watch on occasion is McNeal Lehrer on public television and that's because they can take the time to get into the new story and they don't go for the hype and all that stuff it appears to me that the news media for the most part is uh doing its darndest to appeal to the lowest common denominator and oh buddy so true so true yeah yeah i always liked all things considered um-hum yeah yeah same story here i uh happened to cross that that beauty of a of a station when uh i was with a new car and all i had was an AM radio and i cursed the time for a while and then i found that and i didn't want to go back to FM yeah but uh oh you lucky dogs we get it out of the oh well you get it one way you get it another yeah but myself well li[ke]- for example with this you know the democratic race we got going here the different candidates we got all this other stuff all i'm seeing are a couple of yahoos and uh no issues so to speak yeah ah yeah oh yeah i mean heard more i heard more about Jennifer Flowers than i hear[d]- i have heard about Bill Clinton's uh platform on health care yeah oh yeah you yeah that's right well as i always like to say back when he was talking about a thousand points of light that's a nice way of saying our platform is full of holes hey there you go i'll make that into a tag line in my system all right oh goodness but i don't know for the most part i see the media for the most part pandering like i said to the lowest common denominator because when it gets down to the nitty-gritty and the brass tacks it gets real unpopular and it looses advertisers and it looses starts hurting in the budget so it has to cater somewhere yeah infotainment yeah yeah that's true um-hum yeah and it's been a long time since i've seen any you know source of the media do anything really gutsy we had a situation here in Des Moines when um it was right after Jeffrey Dahlmer had been apprehended that um the animal rights groups ran an ad which excepted which depicted the of animals very much akin to the uh victims of Jeffrey Dahlmer well the register ran it which i think was the right role and privilege and i would be packing pulled out a quarter of a million in advertising you know socked it right to them_1 and that's i guess uh something that distresses me when they have to cater to all these different special interest groups we're not going to get the news yeah well yeah and that's unfortunate yeah they they've got to work harder because right now when you challenge funding for public radio or public television you're no longer being typecast as trying to kill big bird you know they're uh i	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
so we're supposed to talk about computers and you ow[n]- and you own one course a[ll]- right uh-huh so do you do you happen to work for some uh computer company up there in yeah that's why you have a computer at home uh-huh does it make a lot easier uh-huh uh-huh well actually uh i just go with the times and and actually and to human factors and i uh i you know i was into when i was in college i had a Commodore sixty four went to college uh oh at at work they had IBM PCs and compatibles and i worked for them f[or]- with them for a y[ear]- few years but i didn't have a need to ha[ve]- have one at home because of as a poor graduate student i didn't have money and also because uh there're plenty of them_1 around at work but then came the Macintosh and it they came out with the Mac 2 which is a whole lot more useful than any other Macintosh tha[t]- that had come out and they also came out with Hypercard and i needed to use that for my dissertation work yeah so i didn't i had to uh use uh i didn't have access to computers at work very easily everyone was wanting to use it so i bought my own and that's where i started and i bought subsequently after that uh well uh replacement ones yeah oh no no no no i've had this SE thirty for f[or]- number of years now couple years at least three years almost now uh s[o]- uh-huh um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum well as you know ge[tting]- we're getting away from that but that's why you have one at home because it was cost effective and you got your work done basically um it helped me get my work done because uh it's you know i'm i'm into human computer interaction and human and computer interfaces it was one of the better ones and so yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
this is Tad in Seattle ah well i guess i had to wait a long time till they found somebody oh i don't know quite a while i was about to go to sleep well you ready okay you ready okay okay well um provocative topic as usually yeah yeah i uh well i'm kind of um waffling i don't know i i uh i don't really like the idea but then occasionally i hear about a heinous crime where i think well if we're going to have public capital punishment then you know this guy should definitely get it one thing that bugs me about it is the uh finality of it i mean occasionally they make a mistake and send the wrong guy to prison sometime later they you know figure it out and they release him and uh it bugs me that uh you know this is the one kind of punishment that they definitely can't reverse um-hum um-hum yeah i uh course usually the case where there's a bunch of witnesses and they see one guy uh mow down a bunch of people and those cases the guy usually turns the gun on himself anyway yeah yeah well but um if uh if you don't execute sick people um for acting out their sickness uh how by definition can you execute anybody who pulls off a crime like that i mean since they're obviously insane course i guess there's a definition of insanity of whether the[y]- or not they knew what they were doing that's a little different than what i'm talking about um-hum yeah but uh i[t]- i[t]- there's a case where the guy's obviously ill i mean a guy that opens up people's brains and performs lobotomies amateur lobotomies i mean is obviously not rational i don't know i don't know whether you can you know morally take the power of the state to end that guy's life i i don't know i maybe that's a good reason to end his life if if he's that well yeah i don't know that there's any hope of rehabilitating him but the but then the question comes up does the does the state have the right to do you know essentially the same what he did	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

do you think that there's any way that uh or do you think there's too much crime now i mean i guess any crime is too much but it's out of control really i would not of i okay_1 i wouldn't have guessed that in Seattle yeah i know yeah i wonder i mean i wonder what what really is the answer i mean it seems like our our the prison systems we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or a penal system yeah but but the problem is th[at]- that we we only have but so much room and we we try to put aside in the warehouse and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and commit crimes and so it's uh i get the feeling that a lot of people have i'm not convinced that i have um see i mean my mom taught English as a second language a[nd]- and and she was dealing mostly with people that were were in on drug crimes and um yes in a in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia and the problem she had was not with the inmates at all the the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison i mean it was it was i mean they they put her i mean i didn't obviously didn't see the classroom u[m]- um hopefully never will but uh they they put her at the end of a hallway there were no other classes going on at the time and they refused to let her wear a body a[larm]- a body alarm which i know i don't know exactly what that is but i just assume it's something that she could hit immediately and and really annoy a lot of people but uh you know i- i'd ge[t]- no she didn't she didn't she she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates and then later on the uh the administration kept getting worse and uh she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't she didn't feel quite as comfortable around but well she had decided that it was when we came back to the states she decided that it was too she didn't feel that public schools were were safe so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison but uh yeah but but the point there was is that it you know you said that perhaps uh people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible and and i'm i'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in that run the system have given up on it um-hum but getting i mean well see i always have problems because because i can never decide whether or not i'm i'm supposed to be a conservative or or a liberal but but i kee[p]- i keep thinking that there's got to be some way that that a lot of this is circumstances i mean i can't help but wonder if if i grew up without a father on the streets and with like little or no money wouldn't wouldn't i be in prison at this point or another i mean i don't know i don't know we got methadone programs where people who desperately wanna get off drugs can't get onto the program i don't i don't remember the the gentleman's name but there's the uh the mayor of Baltimore is a is a Rhodes Scholar and what he well what he wants to do is take all the money that um he gets for drug enforcement and use it for uh drug education and basically just just attack the problem at the demand side stop trying to attack supply because which which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't i mean Switzerland tried the the grand experiment and you know they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
before the one will take um okay let's see i guess um i can start i'm actually we're actually trying to find one now because_1 our family's growing yeah um so i'm looking at um something larger than what we have we've got like an eighty four Charger that's about gone and a uh an eighty nine Horizon so i'm looking for something a little bigger yeah um so we were thinking minivan for a while and uh we're looking at uh some just some four door five passenger sedans as well um i don't really have a preference either way i guess i[t]- you know it's you know i guess the American cars had a bad reputation but i haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones i've had um-hum yeah yeah i mean e[ven]- even if it's just little details it seems like uh they you know like uh there's a door seal that doesn't quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while an[d]- and it's clearly just a a design problem there um-hum oh like a Miata or something like that um interest[ing]- yeah that's interesting yeah i guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because_1 i look for you know size and safety and then mileage probably uh-huh yeah yeah i c[an]- i think in terms of computer terminology i look at you know price performance and things like that and then a little bit at life expectancy i guess but it you know depends on what you what you pay initially but you know i've got a hundred and twenty five thousand miles on the Charger actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton it's you know we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles but um the other ninety four thousand have been so but uh um um-hum yeah that's interesting but yeah it it's hard to beat some of the uh like i guess we're in particular we're looking at a like a ninety one Corsica that's uh buy back at a they say GM sponsored auction but i think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to GM after you know it's after they've used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you yeah because_1 uh i guess um i mean well ninety two's granted but the new ones you know fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot so all the depreciation has been taken off and guess the dealer comes out okay you know i don't know what kind of i don't know what GM corporate kind of hit the i don't know what kind of hit they take on it but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off of it so but uh i don't know we keep looking at that minivan it's just you know we can get a like a Caravan for right twelve five but that's a little more than we want to spend right now but uh uh it's interesting but uh i don't know if if uh i[t]- it seems to be	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay well needless to say here in Washington DC this is the war zone uh DC around here stands for drug capital or death capital it's uh it's really bad here uh for example the uh local high school uh they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns and they're starting to uh get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school of all things so i[t]- uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh right that's how they uh they bind themselves together in groups i guess and uh now the interestingly enough i don't think we have here a a lot of gangs but uh only a couple uh of not a whole large group of them but uh just a few most of them centered around uh drug territory and so they're protecting their economic interests i guess and uh n[ow]- nowadays the latest thing i've i've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as uh crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing uh cars like at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up and then as you get out of the car they just uh step up and uh take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house yeah that's the uh latest thing that way there's no damage to the car or anything they just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want uh-huh right just wait for you to drive to your house you get out and they get off they go with your car so it's uh i think they call it car jacking around here uh-huh yeah that's kind of the latest thing but oh every year in the DC area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides so it's uh it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here we're from uh i'm from Ohio and my wife's from Florida so and we've just come from twenty years in the military and uh which is an entirely different environment so this is a whole new thing for for us to to have to put up with and it's uh really scary sometimes right and it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school and uh of course the mayor uh of DC is having a real problem uh trying to what do you do to to reduce crime in a in a major city like DC where it's a way of life for everybody it's uh i would hate to have to wrestle with that problem i don't know what what the solution is uh there's no way they can stop the drugs and that's what's causing all the killing uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and they see all their friends and neighbors uh yeah and their friends are driving Mercedes and so it's actually they grow up with that as their way of life and uh i think uh to a large extent they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised right exactly so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes and they they say well it's it's the law that's uh got to be changed instead of their way of life so i don't know it's i'm glad it's not the kind of problem i have to come up with an answer to because it's not easy uh-huh right they've always been with us uh-huh uh-huh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay so what kind of experience do you do you have then with child care does it say something okay well does it usually make a recording or s[omething]- okay okay um-hum i have three uh-huh yeah i do yes um i don't work though but i used to work and when i had two children i work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit but i don't envy anybody who's in situation to find day care but does your sister live in a big community um-hum oh really um-hum um um-hum wow how lucky i- i know a lot of people around here sometimes have like mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids and but the community i'm in is not a real large one so there are a lot of people who babysit in their home that you know you either know them or know somebody who knows them to get to yeah to get references and that so but um i i do[n't]- don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center but simply because_1 there's so many kids and so many yeah and um you know colds and things get spread real easy and things but and they're expensive and course there's a lot of different types of day care available too you know where they teach them academic things or they just watch them and let them_1 play and things like that but take a long time to find the right place um-hum um-hum um-hum when he starts toddling around and stuff yeah um-hum it would be hard i think it would be kind of stressful it would be nice to have him around but um seems like you know go[lly]- what if he cried at the wrong time or the phone rang or you know at the wrong time but um-hum well when you have kids will you work do you work now um-hum um-hum um yeah uh actually i teach my kids at home so i'm here all the time uh-huh yeah yeah so not it depends on the state you live actually some laws absolutely prohibit it some states um say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that our state doesn't yet say that and i'm not a certified teacher i went to college but i you know but my kids are only elementary grades levels right now and so one of them_1 was for a couple of years and so you know my oldest he was and then my youngest two have never been so anyway but we don't	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
all right they're pretty good they um you know i can't they're no[t]- they're they're a good team you know uh but uh i think uh i don't know how they'll do this year they'll probably still do pretty good have you uh been keeping up on the people they've been trading or anything yeah yeah yeah oh yeah they yeah but most of them_1 are what over six foot aren't they and two hundred and some pounds yeah he's he's one of the taller quarterbacks you know most quarterbacks are only about six foot but but uh he's one of the taller ones uh huh that's a good question well they might be i haven't really heard who they been uh trading or anything but uh they're usually pretty good right up near the top and so are the Raiders so it's gonna be tough they always have a tough time with the Raiders so yeah um-hum oh yeah i i think what one of their problems is is they they get overconfident in the second half they get ahead in the first half and the second half they just kind of blow it you know and they've done that every season every year for a while oh he's getting up there in the years i don't know if he's gonna stick around or not you know uh yeah yeah it's that uh i can't think of his name now but he's on defensive yeah he's on defensive he's supposed to be pretty good though so yeah i think so uh uh i really don't even keep up with the college teams that much you know i'm just basically pro teams you know basically yeah yeah uh oh course uh now i get Sunday and Monday n[ights]- Sunday afternoon and Monday nights are reserved for me yeah well well i kind of let her watch every now and then i'll let her watch her shows and then when her shows are over i'll turn it to the last quarter like on Monday nights so i think some of it's pretty good and some of it's not so good you know i kind of go either way on it yeah oh yeah that's kind of yeah that's just like a couple of them_1 instant replays they did they were over their two minute limit and stuff this last year and i think that's what's gonna hurt them_1 from having it but uh but i don't know Dallas is coming up pretty good they did pretty good last year	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well well um i believe a trial by twelve uh peers is fair i don't think the need for a unanimous vote is fair nothing in our world seems to be by unanimous vote except that hm we're too uh diverse a cultures i believe to make a complete agreement i do i really do i agree with that i agree i think that's very true i'm um concerned that when we uh sentence a uh a criminal to for a certain amount of years that we don't really know what that means you know ten years may mean one year in reality and i don't think that most people are aware of that you know i i wouldn't couldn't tell you if we sentenced someone tomorrow how long he'd actually be in jail could you me either and i think they kind of depend on that these criminals but it um-hum definitely would but i see where they would be experts um right it could really throw the checks and balances out of whack what if one of them is corrupt and he is the the decision the the main decision maker you know the the they're split either way it does but that's kind of goes like our Supreme Court and who gets to point those people the politicians so they get to make the decision not the people um-hum that's true i think a good start would be maybe some uh simple basic education into how the process really works for children on up i mean i kn[ow]- i know that we all learned but i really don't see it where the children are learning it nowadays they think it's a big game and you know are are you willing to take off from work and lose a day's pay or a week's pay is your boss willing to let yeah oh definitely	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what kind of crime do you think um is the most prevalent in our society such as New York City yeah i i i wonder if um if drug use is a more prevalent crime though because i mean so many people use it and even though just using is not really i mean it is a crime well that's true but i was i i was s[taying]- staying in the realm of of felonies versus misdemeanors and uh drug use well actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor but um what kind what kind have you been uh have you been the subject of such a crime such as stealing or anything that that's not that much i mean you know those aren't i yeah i think it is i in some ways it's almost worse than murder um murder murder is is hard on the people that were related to b[ut]- you know i mean it is a rather final solution yes what d[o]- what do you think is uh is an appropriate um punishment for some of the various you know such as things such as rape or or uh murder or something like that i agree with that yeah i think Virginia does too up here yeah i think the appeal process takes too long i think i i think it should take from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year um-hum well yeah i mean the system isn't perfect i mean it's run by a bunch of imperfect humans you do the best you can to make it perfect you know you you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect but i think you have to accept some of the errors i think that murder itself would decrease significantly if if there was a credible punishment um for murderers and society probably too i mean just general society to um yeah it does and and it decreases the prison population and which is significant i mean yeah yeah generally the crimes of passion and things like that um are not premeditated i mean they can be but usually they aren't they're spur of the moment and uh the premeditated murders the ones where the person plots and plans when you catch those those individuals i think that you you end up with a uh uh how do i want to you end up with a s[omeone]- you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time yes they they would have no problems doing it again um-hum and i think locking them_1 up for you know fifty years doesn't do uh any good because as a as a taxpayer i'm going to pay you know one and a	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what well what kind of job do you have uh-huh oh okay i[s]- is that because you're a student or oh oh okay okay well i'm a student that's why i was asking and i um i haven't been working this semester so i don't really have uh much to say about that but i do work in the hospitals once a week um i don't g[et]- yeah i have i wear a uniform a nursing uniform so i don't really have much choice yeah they they tend to be pretty expensive um yeah they should uh unless you just buy a few and wear keep wearing those all the time and yeah and and people tend to use bleach on them_1 because you know you want them_1 to stay white and that kind of deteriorates it a little bit but um i'm hoping mine my one will last me a long time until i have to start working more days and there's not much of a selection at least in my price range like styles or things so yeah so um oh you did oh okay that sure does yeah were you a receptionist oh okay yeah definitely uh-huh that sounds good right also the shoes are expensive that yeah that's really tough before i went back to school i worked as a uh what do you call it can't even remember it's been so long um office administrator or whatever it one of those titles uh sort of and it was mo[re]- a more of a casual uh atmosphere but i still wore dresses and things like that so i mean it was for a uh nonprofit organization so right yeah i agree i i really i totally agree i have a friend that has a knack for looking really stylish but always comfortable yeah she's really good at doing that exactly um-hum yeah yeah well she she you don't have to wear high heels to look good yeah she never wore high she's an engineer an[d]- she never yeah she never wore high heels just flats and low low heels um-hum more of a classic look yeah see that doesn't have to be uncomfortable yeah but you're right i think those things tend to be more expensive yeah uh-huh right yeah because um also you tend to those things don't go out of style so much and uh i find right yeah and since i'm a student i never buy fad clothes because_1 i know they'll be out of style the next season and then i have to go buy more so i just don't buy any um-hum i know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i don't know um i haven't it's been um well seventy nine since i was at school at high school and um i've seen things change i don't know if i've seen things change enough that i can actually because i wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then so it's hard to compare you know what i mean but um it seems like when i li[ved]- i lived in Chicago i've i've lived down here i hear the dropout rates from the schools and i certainly see how much i pay in real estate taxes every year and i begin to wonder if i'm really getting my money's worth i mean i i've seen so many different things so so many different bad reports coming out of the school system and i recognize that there are good schools out there i mean somebody's getting getting a good education because we continue to employ people but um i don't i don't understand the um i don't understand i guess why the schools don['t]- seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities i don't know if i blame it on the school i think i think i blame it i think i blame it on a couple of different things i think i blame it on the school system um yeah i don't blame it on the teachers in the school i although i think that i do know for a fact that some of the teachers that i know personally get paid an awful lot more than well they do quite well for themselves no not all school districts are well paid but there are some school districts out there that are very well paid i mean i know one family that's got they're both teachers and they both have like second jobs that they work in the afternoons they both work all summer full-time and from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each i mean that family is making over a hundred grand and i'm i mean okay okay yes i agree that teaching our kids is important however these people who only work eight hours a day at it from seven to three and they only work nine months a year and they get an awful lot of breaks in between and that's my tax dollars that i'm spending on that and i don't even have kids	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
your turn but not for petty theft well it should be used as a deterrent do you think or should it be used uh a[s]- to prevent further uh crime li[ke]- hm um-hum well you know there's this old um Jewish is it saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth uh one of the things i was thinking about is uh you know from society's point of view if you put a value on each person what you want to do is to maximize the end game value so if you have someone that that destroys that value uh then what you want to take steps to uh minimize the loss of course you have to also put value on the criminal so if you terminate him that's a loss of value so you know if you weight everyone equally then you have to say well the likelihood of not terminating him i[f]- if you don't terminate him the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person in other words you'd have to you'd have to murder more than one other person uh in order to justify taking his life another way you could do it is weight this value by uh the value to society of the people uh which is pretty uh delicate thing to do but one way of doing it is uh by income so if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money which is often times the case then then he's obviously not worth very much and so uh the likelihood that you know maybe expected expected murders by him is is um integrated over the income of the people uh that he murders is maybe you know a loss of who knows eight hundred thousand dollars uh but if he only uh integrated you know integrated income over the ex[pected]- expected remainder of his life is um small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it's more easy it's easier to uh to uh uh terminate older people than younger people since the uh uh integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less which means well i suppose you could say well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation um-hum now that's all fine and well and and uh good philosophically but if you're involved yourself personally uh i know i have a friend whose uh son was murdered o[n]- on the night before his sixteenth birthday and let me tell you uh i- i knew them personally uh not intimately but quite well and uh you're talking about real trauma i mean trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies uh the father you know o[f]- of course um a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get i think in terms of psychological impact um and oh yes they found him and he is on trial for capital murder uh well actually he i['m]- i'm sorry he uh was convicted uh and of course now you know and you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process but	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the only experience i have i don't have any children but i've um i was a babysitter in high school and then just recently after we were married i babysat for a dentist while she worked and i just uh-huh is it oh yeah the expense uh-huh just sit around that's true see the lady i did it for that's why she p[icked]- picked me is because i would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up so she could sleep in and um then she could be at home and then i'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if i wanted too or whatever but um she paid i think it was two or th[ree]- it was about two fifty three dollars a hour and by the time i paid taxes on it it i was getting like eighty cents and that wasn't counting food or gas or anything yeah right oh wow wow yeah i think people that treat their baby sitters like that get a lot better baby sitters and they stick around for longer because i mean after i figured out i was getting eighty cents an hour i said it and i quit you i was just like but i'm wasting my time i really liked the little girl and everything but i thought yeah yeah i uh-huh well and she was really spoiled they didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything so basically they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch and the mom was a dentist and i was just like we've got to quit this and she's like no i don't want her to starve but i don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat like eat this or so i can see the concerns on what different people want because some i mean you know if i was setting up a day care there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to because_1 some parents won't put up with anything where others would uh-huh no that's true i i'd love to do it but i just don't trust people now there's too many lawsuits i just i think it's a bigger risk than yeah it would scare me with i don't know because_1 i'm sure some of them have good reason to sue but i think a lot of them are just you know they're negligent and they get happy about money and they just want to sue you um-hum oh yeah that's impossible i have a girlfriend that works at a day care and she takes her little girl with her and i mean she told me about half the people that they hire and half of them_1 she'd like to turn them_1 into the state and that's the people that are working there you know and then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in you know like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before the same diaper you know just awful things and so i don't know i don't have kids but i always think man i just don't know if i could trust anybody i mean you just don't know oh yeah that's true yeah it would just rip me apart i think i don't know not knowing	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
i- i have had um i did a stint as a single parent for awhile and my circumstance dealt with kids who were in school and i thought that that was probably more difficult to deal with because finding someone who would fill those small time slots early in the morning and after school what you were left with were uh high school girls or boys and uh never mind that they had all those noble uh qualities like you know you know the same philosophy of raising that you did you were probably lucky to get anybody because you weren't paying them very much and uh it was just a short period of time so uh it was really kind of someone who would sit and watch TV with them it it wasn't the kind of thing that you would get involved in if you had small children and you had child raising thoughts in mind it was kind of a temporary um babysitting kind of thing have you dealt with that oh are you pleased with the situation hm it wasn't convenient hm i understand from people who have live in help au pairs and and you know just people who live with them that very often you end up involved in their personal problems and they're taking care of your kids and you're taking care of them do you find that uh-huh you said you have a couple of changes do the kids get attached to one person and then it's a problem to wean them off them how old are the kids hm i imagine that is a uh-huh have you ever discussed with your caretaker how you want your children raised what your philosophies are oh well i you know i think this the thing is um your situation is what i would call ideal but it's probably taking both you wor[king]- you know you and your wife working to afford this person isn't that so right when i was home by myself and i had a uh an eight year old and a six year old um there aren't that many choices and that's the scary part you're just happy to get someone you know you really are in such desperate need and if your child's sick there's the panic it's like i can't stay home what do i do and you know you import grandma from the other town to come over it was an emergency you know Christmas vacation comes around and then you've got to fill in that block of time	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh do you have a couple of children uh-huh oh boy at least you're sleeping i have uh two boys one's eleven and one's fourteen i imagine the activities we uh encounter with our kids are quite point oh i remember them fondly it seems like th[e]- the b[aby]- like young children uh destroy your sleep and older children destroy your and i don't really mean that it oh i think the biggest problem is that you just have no training for this and you really have to wing it you know as you go but i i remember fondly having the small ones they they seemed real happy and it was so easy to solve their problems and as they get older it just seems that everything is more serious a[nd]- a[nd]- it's more complicated it's emotional it's not a matter of giving them_1 a lollipop anymore i[t]- it just gets harder but um what we've done and you might want to do as you know as time flies by is i'm remarried and my husband never had any kids so we were trying to figure out how um how we would make this turnover as smooth as possible and we came up with what we call the family meeting and once a week we get together and this is a chance when the kids can say whatever they want without us getting insulted about it and we have sort of an agenda that's like good news this week bad news this week uh suggestions any new business any uh any que[stions]- questions any anything and we well i[t]- it changes it could be a quiet week it could be the kind of thing where kids want to go do something so it goes pretty quick at the end is allowance so they have to make it through collect well you know we we actually sit and talk to each other once a week at least not that we don't all the time but it i[t]- it works out nicely and i don't know you know i think i'd do that even if i wasn't remarried if i had thought about it and you know we p[lan]- also plan a family activity because people are coming and going and it's hard to be all together to do something so well it could be a game of Scrabble an[d]- or it could be you know reading a book out loud or making up a story and passing it around the table you know one sentence to each person and um it's it's not something that's impossible i mean the kids will usually want to go to a game park or something you know we can't do that you we try to keep it real oh yeah that another thing that comes up with us is family vacation we just kind of knock our heads we don't know how to make that right it seems as if we do what they want uh we {marathoned} a trip in California we stayed with some relatives for awhile and then we went to Sea World and we went to Disneyland and we we went to every kid thing uh no we we flew to California and we stayed free at my aunt's house so that gave us a base in San Diego and we saw Sea World and the zoo and this and that and our lives were sort of normal because w[e]- you know it was someone else's house so we made sure we had dinner at dinnertime and that kind of thing then we drove a bit further and when we were on our own it just kind of fell apart because_1 we'd stay late at the parks and i didn't enjoy it after awhile you know once is you know it's interesting but it's really not my cup of tea and family vacations are kind of difficult you know sharing a room with the kids is not much once they're old enough to know the difference so hm well i guess the playgrounds used to be hot when the kids huh there might be some at the schools you know that you can use when it's an off time you know on a weekend or something and a lot of if you have a a YMCA or something they have kind of a tot programs where they have little exercise class for kids her age and all kinds of things what help yeah go ahead huh yeah but that's not your problem that's the fun of it

oh i suppose i uh substitute teach in our public schools and what i find out nowadays is people are wearing jeans and and very casual things Polo shirts i'm of the opinion that i'm not one of the kids and i want them to know that so i'll dress a little more formally i mean not a business suit but you know a nice skirt and blouse or well i- i should clarify i work in the i'm an artist and i work in the art department so perhaps they are a little more Bohemian but yes yes teachers are wearing jeans and they're wearing sneakers kind of upsets me because uh it seems that they're getting treated as if they're sloppy and i- i like the kids as if i[f]- if the whole situation is too casual i don't get think they get the same respect as if they distance themselves in their behavior from the kids and i think the way they dress says a lot about their attitude i think they're too casual with the kids and the ki[ds]- kids curse in front of them and a[nd]- and take too many liberties and i think uh you know as much as i'm there to be their uh to be there for them but i'm not their friend i'm there to teach them something and i[t's]- it's business and it's serious and well i i think i'm talking about dressing how it conveys a uh a sense of um casual behavior and you know and and where it goes from there it's just a tangent of the same subject uh-huh what i[s]- is uh your particular field huh oh so you must be very interested in uh Texas Instruments but anyway get off the subject so i i guess you're in a business suit all the time oh hm uh-huh it it well i guess it's silly in that the point is to be there and do quality work and not wonder about what you're wearing too wha[t]- uh no i can see how you'd say that i'm not heavily into uh what's in this year or what's out this year i u[sually]- i have a certain amount of money that i spend on clothing and i buy things that will last year after year and um oh do you so i guess you've got a collection don't you uh-huh well i don't know um i think it was just um clothing and how you feel about it and do you change your wardrobe from season to season um i guess the warmer it gets the less clothing i but i don't know that i i change my sense of color or style to to match a season but i do know people who have told me that the different carpets come out and different colors come out because uh the seasons change your mood and and your ideas of color and fashion change with uh uh you know with your mood and i guess it's all kinds of poetic uh i've met males that aren't terribly oblivious to clothing it's uh well some guys seem to think it's a shortcoming being too involved in their clothing like they have deeper more meaningful things	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what do you think uh oh i can be but go ahead right right we fax everything we don't even wait for the mail anymore right right um-hum right right you're expected to exactly and i recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse it should be less because we have a microwave and our grandmother's had to bake brownies and we can throw them_1 in a microwave for two minutes but the more conveniences we have the more that's expected of us and we have no downtime like we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to so we keep moving we don't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen we just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing so we have no relaxation time in between so they say that's really a bad thing that you need to learn a lot of ways to to deal with that and get your your time in between things so that's good that's an interesting point but i just think our our family lives have changed drastically and i think that's jus[t]- of course a part of it is technology i mean our kids where would they be without Nintendo and you know their TV shows and that and some of that is really bad i think but we have all single families so many single families now um a lot of working both parents are working so -[th]ere's a whole big effect on our kids and not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father you know i'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years you're probably right and i'm an O B nurse and that's never really occurred to me but that's that's interesting i never really thought about it that way yeah yeah that's true when is this good or not good we don't know that yet yeah i don't know either that's true right right yeah yeah that's kind of scary hum well that's true but i it's just very very different and i guess every ten years it's just been very different so and i don't know what's gonna happen um i know what i'm seeing here at my we[ll]- my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they're establishing careers and they've got their homes and they've got a l[ot]-	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i imagine you can't escape it well of course it was fun for you to oh really i was born and raised in uh near Miami and uh spent the last twenty years in Dallas uh where the Rangers played and uh for the last uh what year roughly year i've been in San Francisco where there're two teams the Oakland A's and the San Francisco Giants uh but honestly you know i uh i do my duty and watch the sports on uh the newscast but that's about all the exposure i have to sports um-hum well yeah sure well i guess the uh San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A's were like the leading teams a couple years ago well i thin[k]- i don't know we[ll]- that's sort of what i gather um and uh i don't know what is the prognosis for uh this year oh good i i assume that means good for the Minnesota yep i think a train went by but i know a train went by i don't know what the noise was but i think it probably was the the train well i don't know i i i don't even know uh wh[o]- who has been winning in uh as far as the uh San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A's but i think they both won their opener i sort of gathered that in my uh subliminal memory hm um-hum i guess they're in different leagues is that right the A's yeah um-hum um-hum um-hum eighty six well they must play every day then i mean eighty six times two is a hundred and sixty and that's Lord that's uh over five months worth even if they play every day that's over five months worth no that was the Super Bowl i don't feel so bad i think you you don't know all that much more than i do about i see okay oh really okay well well i- i i know uh the Super Bowl	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um taxes you want to go ahead um-hum i agree um-hum well i think uh you know when i look at um all the things that are coming out now about over spending and spending money that's not there and buying things that are extremely expensive where they could buy it at it at a better discount um when you when exactly exactly that's exactly um the whole thing when you take a look at all those issues of where our money is going and it's just as long as the the person that's spending the money uh doesn't think about oh i can go out and spend anything that i want to it's just unlimited right an unlimited source so they they think well i'll go out and buy a four hundred dollar toilet seat and i could have went to Kmart and bought it for you know ten or fifteen i mean that kind of thing and uh exactly exactly and i know a lot of uh corporations now are looking at their amount of money that's being spent and they're looking at what's the best buy it used to be you could go if you had a company you had to go through certain people and you didn't care what you paid i mean you just got it done now people are putting in bids for things and are looking at things going to actually shop at Best Buy for Best Buy is one of our electronics stores for fax machines things like that instead of going through these office supply companies that mark up their amounts and say you know i'll give you a legal pad for five bucks and you can go to another shop and get if for maybe sixty cents or n[inety]- or ninety cents that kind of thing so except for everything keeps going up you know and i know as a middle class um you know and also i have one dependent has my daughter and i keep looking at well where's the tax so-called tax um uh relief for having children i mean there is none i mean i think i paid just as much as when i didn't have her so um-hum sure exactly uh-huh exactly yeah that's the whole thing now they've gotten this wonderful idea of not taking out as much taxes but you're still gonna owe the government as much money so by the end of this coming year what's gonna happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government and it certainly isn't going to be in their savings uh account they won't be able to pay it and there'll be a lot of problems because of that you know put people into you know January or February which is always supposed to be this month after Christmas is supposed to be high spending because everything is on sale nobody's gonna have the money to spend they're gonna be paying on their taxes so they're gonna have to just cut back so i don't know where the answer is and yeah yeah no no well that's the whole thing i think people are getting so fed up with it now we go through another election and listen to all these lies about the no no well i don't think people think they can make a difference and when you've got candidates as you do it's candidates that have money and it's backed by big business and big business says well we don't care about the little person and uh you know you're not going to get anymore Abe Lincolns around um-hum well who knows uh yeah generations from now we might uh set back in our little uh rocking chairs and watch our grandchildren go through an entirely different system of things and say you know this government itself isn't working just like the communist government of uh the old uh USSR and maybe that's gonna happen to America where they'll say hey we're fed up maybe it'll have to be just individual state tax and each state take care of itself and no government type of uh you know where you have to pay out to federal or whatever i don't know who knows but um-hum yeah everybody is in fact i'm not sending in my tax money	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

an avid camper uh-huh there is sort of a wide range of camping opportunities i remember when i was a kid my o[nly]- my only camping experience was when i was about thirteen or so and it the Y camp used to have an overnight every so often and we'd cut down a couple of saplings or you nowadays you wouldn't cut down and we'd lash them up which lash was tying and we'd make sort of a triangular thing an[d]- you know with a tarp over the top and um sleeping bag dug a hole made a fire uh the old shovel with the toilet paper over it so that i think that's real legitimate camping uh just recently uh my husband and i and our kids joined a friend whose parents has one of the have one of these big Silver Bullet trailers that stay parked in upstate New York and i chuckled when i got there there was a microwave oven and a gas stove and five bunk beds and heat for the evening i mean yeah but it was so big that you know they don't use it {mobilely} it just you know you you pull it somewhere and you leave it there it's sort of like a summer house i and i guess that's camping too um um-hum oh tell me about it you ready for Dayton right uh-huh i think i've heard something about this you go set up a tower right um-hum uh right i mean you know there's not that much free time and i don't know uh we we we daydream about going camping i guess uh there's a very nice state park around here um that we're on Long Island and um near Montauk if you've ever heard of it the big light house out there there's a beach state park where you can you know they have tent sites i guess we'd have to rent all that stuff and and there's picnic tables and there's the beach and i guess it's pretty popular it's sort of a um a lottery for who gets it and you have to apply at the right time and people in the know how do that and we keep thinking about doing it and it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um i think um uh actually i'm uh fairly pleased with the benefits that we have at the uh working for a large corporation and for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important i think it's health care it's what i think everybody would say that right belonging to a group is the belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you um so the um sometimes i think it's more important salary yes and um i don't know if i would rank that second but um since i have three boys uh it it can turn out to be important you know in a in a given year dental ca[n]- dental expenses can really kill you right right it's uh right uh and then uh um if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodontics will uh i guess that would be up there uh i'm not sure if i would rank uh how i would rank that next to say compared to retirement or uh um um pre tax savings was another thing that i think is a a great a great benefit when i and i r[eally]- i think it's really something that the uh the government ought to encourage more because uh there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in uh Germany and Japan um right when you have the when you have the uh the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has and you can uh offer some incentive and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up uh the savings and the that you wouldn't otherwise do an[d]- leave you know i i don't think so yet they may have uh just plain parental leave which either one can take uh i their uh i know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which i think is too short uh uh uh i really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks right a[nd]- and uh there there ought to be uh uh some compromise that could where uh where the person would be guaranteed a uh career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position uh in exchange for a longer period of time it's uh it's so important to families then and uh and yet anybody whose gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up um that yeah you're right i think you've put your finger on the one benefit that i that i would most like to see uh changed um the uh parental leave right right they do it by shortchanging their kids there no other way i mean uh unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely um -[w]ith people moving as much and uh they're just it's just a terrible choice y[ou]- shouldn't have to make it uh right and uh oh right boy would i like to have that yeah oh listen i have friends in a lot of different cities if you'd just fly me there i'll take care of that right so and uh i guess the uh the i[dea]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i'm ready if you are well i think that people should be allowed to have them_1 especially_1 if they go hunting which my son goes hunting he goes deer hunting he goes duck hunting uh he's read books about guns since he was like probably eleven or twelve years old and i just think that uh as far as that's concerned he should be able to have them_1 to go hunting with you know as far as just having handguns around to to have them_1 i don't believe that you should have handguns around well no there's too many sports people out there that that do do these things yeah well i suppose you could uh um-hum and i think if they want one they're going to get one you know the bad guys are you know like i say if they want a gun they're going to find out or somehow to get one well i agree with you on that because i know uh in fact i had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time and for a rifle there's no waiting there wasn't anyhow now there might be now but there wasn't anything for you know rifles and things like that i guess it was just handguns that there was a some kind of a waiting you know a two weeks while they checked you out or something but uh most of these people that's got these guns that's going around you know robbing people and shooting people um-hum um-hum i- i see now i know they were having a gun show uh about a month ago and i was just wondering how that did work if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show there's no restriction though you don't have to wait or nothing then huh yeah i was just curious you know because uh i know at at the regular gun show you know gun shop that you that you do have to wait for pistols like a couple of weeks and then they check you out then they call you up and you h[ave]- go pick it up which i think they have to do on rifles and things now too i think there is s[omething]- something like that anyhow here out here in California i think there is now but um-hum no we don't have guns because we don't go hunting or anything like that but like i say my son he's he's always had a like a i think his first little rifle we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old but he's always he went to the to the school to learn how to shoot it he goes to the pistol range and uh and the rifle range to shoot them_1 he likes to go to that uh shotgun thing where you shoot at those um yeah right likes to do that you know but uh i don't know i think they should try to control it and everything you know but as far as just banning it completely there that's not going to happen um-hum yeah right right now i do believe though like in California if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has i think they're liable now for it they can be you know put in jail and everything the whoever owned the gun you know now when they have kids around you'd think that they would be locking them_1 up or you know um-hum well they can get into almost anything	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh i have a Ford pickup and uh the family car is a uh a Dodge uh Caravan and uh because we have three kids and they're under thirteen so um they sort of fit our requirement yeah i have a one of those uh pickups with the uh seat with a seat in the back and so they just fit in there when they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work but right now i can right now i can throw them_1 all in the back when we have room and uh and since i do a lot of projects i throw things in the back and i kind of like having a pickup truck actually i think of it as a as a car that'll last i- i like the way trucks are built and i don't care about comfort so i'm pretty happy yeah so i wouldn't hesitate to get another one i i never buy new so i wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck and uh yeah i don't i don't i don't need to pay for the glitz i'll let somebody else uh have the showroom shine enough and i'll pay for the rest of it right and uh the van we're s[ort]- sort of we might go again on a on a van uh we we could probably do with a a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time i'm not sure we have to we we'll have to face it in a couple of years but uh i- i guess we had a small Toyota wagon and we were real happy with that because uh my my second requirement after price is uh low maintenance and uh th[at]- it certainly had that we didn't do much to it at all so um-hum uh-huh uh-huh uh-oh uh-huh at how m[any]- at how many miles huh an[d]- you didn't overheat it uh-huh huh well that was minim[um]- uh-huh yeah i have one colleague that uh commutes to work on one when it's not raining and uh uh he's a it's he's pretty conservative guy i don't think it's much of a sport for him i guess uh i'm sure he does yeah no yeah -[i]t's like yeah right yeah if i only had some place that i could store the uh camper top i would have it off most of the time i really leave it on there just for just to have it out of the way because_1 it put it on the ground it gets dirty but uh yeah they're solid uh trucks are built uh i mean they're the only things Americans still know how to build and uh yeah right i kind of like mine yeah so mine's a Ford an[d]- uh oh i heard about that yes yeah that's the that's a serious truck right this uh i- i know a contractor who just got one of those and he's pleased with it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay what do you think about our politicians yeah i do too uh of course yeah you're right i just uh i think all politicians are really a bunch of crooks i shouldn't say that but i bet you that ninety five percent of them are they're all just for themselves mostly um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah really and then it seems like they bring out all the dirt that they can bring out about a person you know s[tuff]- oh stuff that happened many years ago in their lives i think that's awful yeah right right um-hum um-hum no right all you hear is the bad things about them uh but um it'd be hard uh i don't know what to say really about politicians like i say i just i just can't believe too many of them_1 at all and i read you know about them_1 and everything about different ideas the[y]- they all seem to have something wrong with them oh the one that just got out of Agnus uh-huh um-hum um-hum oh i know it's all over isn't it um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah yeah he wasn't in office very long was he you know oh oh well what did this uh marriage you've got now over there what did he what was he going to do that was different that sounds funny doesn't it tell him to send him down here to Patterson so what do you think about Oakland's mayor i mean Oakland seems like they have an awful lot of problems there you know have you lived there long uh-huh um-hum um-hum yeah i know that that should i say have a lot of in fact more mortgage and every thing this year than they they did yeah um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
so how do you feel about it yeah i- i myself almost um am in favor of it uh i work at Honeywell and i went through a a pretty i don't know i went through a standard drug testing thing before i i was brought on i think that's pretty standard at least at Honeywell it is um i think it's important to insure the quality and and uh i don't know almost the goodness of character you know and that kind of thing where do you work oh okay oh okay hm oh great right um-hum yeah yeah and that that definitely happens you know i mean those the drug tests assure u[s]- they're accurate but there's always that margin of error and that's that's something to be aware of another thing is a lot of times you know they aren't that accurate or they aren't that sensitive like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they gonna do about that you know i was on a couple of different prescription drugs when i was tested for Honeywell and uh uh you know i know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something um i'm sure they screen for just a particular few types although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for um i don't know what what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon oh okay great um yeah i'm a graduate student at UCF in Florida University of Central Florida and this is actually a an internship up here but um they uh even for interns they they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing so right um they essentially <b_aside> no i sure don't <e_aside> um they essentially um they essentially uh made me the offer and then and then uh did the drug testing thing after that so uh it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests and and then they essentially give you the offer and then at that point they'll they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that so uh there's some noise on this end i'm actually in a mall calling so you probably wondered huh but so yeah that's a good question i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave uh if you fail i believe they give you one more chance they probably give you a chance to explain yourself and then maybe give you another chance to go through it but uh you know once again those things are not that accurate so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know but um wha[t]- are you working right now anywhere or okay oh okay great yeah that was the first time i'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening you know was was going to Honeywell a friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there and he's doing an internship with IBM and uh they basically uh did the same exact thing um we both got our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug at the same time so one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process but uh no no that's one thing they don't do is is drug testing while you're on the job uh i think i think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it but they don't do it you know so that's good i guess i don't know i mean i uh i have gone to a couple of parties since since that time and while i don't do any drugs myself i've seen some people who work there um you know smoking a joint or whatever and uh you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up you know but no they don't they don't really do that yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay um let me see unfortunately we are not much recycling we don't we don't do enough i know we don't so uh although uh lately i've been uh a friend of mine that i spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit and it's it it's uh to watch some of the things that she does and then she's almost had an impact on me um where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but i- i can kind of tell it bothers her so uh just unconsciously i've i've stopped buying a lot of um um paper plates and paper cups and i don't do that anymore i don't know why i just from just from socializing with her so it really it there's not a whole lot there really isn't uh i know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio each each house ha[s]- they're they're given three baskets and they put them_1 out on a certain day of the week and each uh home does participate but we really don't have anything uh close in this area that that do anything and and some of the communities that do the residents are having to pay to participate in it which really doesn't make sense yeah that's good yeah yeah that's another thing you have to go to different places to do that uh-huh but i heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that which uh i don't know it just doesn't make sense to me yeah yeah yeah that's good that's good um-hum yeah no oh i didn't know that yeah um-hum well that's good i- i you know unfortunately Garland doesn't have doesn't they don't i don't know they don't do anything like that or i i you know i read those little slips that come in wi[th]- your utility bills or your uh garbage collection and they haven't you know talked about doing something like that she lives in Garland and i'm not sure where what she does but she's uh oh she's ve[ry]- very heavy in that and she takes her own bags to the grocery store um she has n[o]- i r[eally]- i really don't think she has paper products in her house um and just a lot of things i've learned off of her that to start doing and she does make a lot of just her whole house is yeah yeah yeah and uh my little boy ha[s]- watches a program that was really neat i sat and watched him you know the Barney you know the little um i don't know if you know the little character Barney they had one uh on that kind of type of thing and how children can can do that and how to save water b[rush]- you know when you brush your teeth turn the water off and it's really caught on and he's only four and he's really caught on and keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing he has really caught on so that's really neat	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
see wh[en]- whe[n]- when you're with a big company or a big organization a lot of times uh you know the benefits are good and and you know the pay's regular but uh we[ll]- you know sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on and i- i- i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that uh anybody could get in uh in dealing in a with a large company is to be in a situation where you you get to know what's going on and maybe that's that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do what's what's your feeling about benefits what sort of benefits would you like to get from a big compa[ny]- um-hum um-hum well th[at]- i i well i- i work for the government and uh actually i work for the FBI and uh and so well you know we we don't there's lots of things that we don't get told for good reason but uh but basically uh there's lots of things that that we should know about projects i'm an engineer you know i'm i'm a COTR and sometime[s]- and i worked in the same lab with a guy and we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years and we should've you know we're we're now collaborating and it did[n't]- for two years we didn't and wh[ich]- which was uh kind of stupid but uh but uh our organization is doing something else t[omorrow]- on Monday uh we're having a for all unclassified programs we're we're having little tables put out in front of you know lab in the hallways and everyb[ody]- all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do which i thought was kind of interesting and bu[t]- but uh but that sort sort of thing but but i[f]- but ju[st]- i think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on and and but of course most time most the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know and you know if you don't really count if you're not part of the program you might not get told for months or you might you know if it doesn't impact you directly or if your management doesn't think that but but regard to benefits you know most companies have most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and that sort of thing in the private sector i would think that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach you know the the mid fifties wa[s]- is keeping a job until you retire uh and engineers are uh are baggage to most uh uh as they get older to to most companies and uh it's very much like the military it windows out you know you you think well boy i'm getting more money and i'm getting more responsibility i'm doing this but as you climb up that tree pretty soon you're the the the branches get smaller on the top of the tree and pretty soon somebody falls off i['ve]- i've fallen off twice in my private sector and uh an[d]- and you know i can get up um-hum yeah um-hum yeah he may be retired	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
right i think it's kind of a loaded question i don't think anybody would say we should pay more i think most of us feel that we do pay enough um-hum right well i- i think what's happened is a lot of these state and city jobs people feel that once they get them they're entitled to them for life and they can kind of take it easy because they're protected by their unions etcetera uh during my college years my mom worked for the state and she got me a summer job and when i came in i'm i was just a little eager beaver and i went through whatever work they gave me and i found people sitting around me polishing their nails and they were downright disgusted with me because i was going to come and go but they were going to live there and they didn't like me you know showing them up and finishing stuff so what they did was give me worse and worse and ugly and uglier things to do so i would just back off bu[t]- and you know that's what it seemed like from the inside um it's not that no one works i think what happens is it's a personality thing and those who just like to do a job well done get to do the work for three or four freeloaders who don't do it i th[ink]- i- i you know i think it's a cross section of humanity it's not so much all state workers i mean it's hard to generalize like that oh apparently there's been a uh movement where i am i'm on Long Island which is a suburb of N[ew]- New York City and um there's been a movement by home owners to try get their their home taxes reduced they feel their too high and there's all kind of review boards that if you feel strongly about it you can challenge your tax uh the newspapers now running an article on state universities which you know everyone kind of ass[ume]- at least i did assume that you can get a good education and pay so much less than a private University and it seems to be more of an expose than anything i mean you hearing ghastly stories about kids who are taking four and fi[ve]- like five years to graduate because when they try to sign up for a class they're so over crowded they can't get in the class so in order to finish all the uh requisites they have to just stay longer until they can finally get a hold of the class that th[is]- this i thought was totally outrageous that they have teaching assistants well that's that's an old thing you know having graduate students teach undergrads but some of these people are you know from India and Asia and they don't speak English well enough for the students to understand now how could they possibly have someone teaching a class who is not fluent and and i heard that that's true i mean that's i find that incredible that's a uh yeah well i guess i have a a private um ar[gument]- argument with them i'm a substitute teacher who you know have have has raised a family my kids are older now and i'd like to work full-time and they're firing teachers left and right and the classes are getting bigger our school budgets are really down maybe it's not handled real efficiently you know that's that's very likely my you know my husband's in the computer business and the schools just you know they're updating computers are the hot new thing and my husband was	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
happen to know what the laws are in Texas uh-huh hum oh i see what you're saying huh well in New Yo[rk]- i'm not quite sure but what sounds familiar to me is that i[t's]- it's not legal except in cases of murder of police officers i might be mistaken but that's what sounds familiar to me so uh so we don't hear about it i was visiting in California recently and apparently they over about two weeks ago they just executed one fellow it is legal there but th[ey]- they always put it off and put it off and they finally for the first time in twenty five years executed someone so that was quite the news is it only usually in cases of murder sort of an eye for an eye kind of thing okay i know there's a a s[ubtle]- subtle difference between manslaughter and murder i guess you can commit manslaughter by running somebody over by accident that kind of thing uh-huh i don't know it just seems to me that everybody wants to know if they do something what's going to happen to them i substitute teach and i have kids who talk fresh don't do homework and they say so what's going to happen to me and and people getting less and less respect and they un[derstand]- they know that the bottom line is not very much is going to happen to them so if i could be sure that the people who are sentenced to execution absolutely did it because you know during the with the jury system you're not quite sure i i- i'd feel comfortable with it if i knew absolutely certainly that this person actually murdered someone but i- i think the reason we don't go for it is because we're afraid that we might be making a mistake and you can't fix it well did you do you find that the kids are changing and they they don't they they don't respect authority anymore i hum well the guns are legal where you are it's quite a to do to get a gun around here legally that is oh i didn't know that okay oh okay that clears th[at]- um-hum well they can do just as much damage that's true	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
why don't you start things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that are they things you already owned or you pick them_1 up just to do that refinishing i've yeah i've done both uh i have had my wife's picked up a couple things saying uh boy if we could refinish that that'd be a beautiful piece of furniture and uh and we've done it a couple of times i guess tha[t]- we've been fairly successful with those that's uh that's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it i guess um i have a a um really nice desk a nicer desk than i could afford i got because my sister who worked in a hospital uh liberated it after a fire and uh we stripped it all the way down and refinished it it turned out to be really nice uh pretty nice desk maple top i think or or something of that sort oh really oh i'm jealous uh-huh yeah i've i do do things uh that might be too crude to be called woodworking i've built my own deck and um things like that and i i definitely have begun to accumulate tools too my i uh i picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive and so i do have a band saw and a router and um things like that out in the garage but i can't say i use them_1 very often they're handy uh they they come in handy at the most unusual times putting doors in is the time when i'm uh i bought myself a um template for making mortices and doors and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel but i've also i've also used them for building drawers where you uh for rabbeting and uh because uh rabbeting on my table on my uh radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain so i got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months i had it and now i- i use it twice a year maybe the big stu[ff]- uh i guess it the ones that what uh i have never even s[een]- i've never even looked at one closely and the the little use that i've gotten from my router i would say uh i would spend my money on the bits um i have a i'd guess you'd call a medium quality Craftsman router and the um it's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say three eighths of an inch at a time but the problem is that the uh as with any any time you buy um a a tool with a[s]- a[s]- as a as a package the bits that they give you are low end so the price of a good set of uh carbide steel uh bits is probably um i mean a a good set of bits is probably gonna run you a hundred dollars and uh um if you're gonna use it for a lifetime i suppose it's worth it because_1 um imagine if i go and sharpen them_1 myself uh it won't last and i've never had the bits sharpened so that's a thing to consider is to yeah and they they dull after a while especially i did some cabinets in um ash and oak and uh that that wears a bit down we remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets uh which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen and i saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth and uh routing hardwood will um take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast so right that's uh and then you take the blade to the to get sharpened right uh-huh right yeah well i've used mine on treated wood and now all my blades need sharpening because uh the treated wood will also chew them_1 up	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay yeah is it i know in here uh downtown Dallas it's you i mean you drive by and you can just you can see it but then again i w[as]- originally was from California and uh there is a big difference between Texas and California and uh they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner and of course they don't have that here in Texas so there's no not in not in Te[xas]- not well not in Dallas that is yeah we're going there tomorrow uh-huh we're packing and getting ready to go to uh-huh yeah oh okay yeah you do then is it really i would not imagine that huh huh you learn something every day uh-huh yeah i've seen that huh i huh-uh huh no oh yeah yeah uh-huh yeah that's true right huh and of course i doubt if there's any you can buy regular anymore you buy unleaded right yeah huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh huh that is good yeah yeah huh oh that would be i think i saw that on TV one time they maybe it was CNN where they were demonstrating that or something similar to that oh but what w[hat]- w[hat]- i think that was a s[etback]- a a setback that they i don't know they went i don't know how many miles an hour i think like twenty w[as]- was that something maybe it was i don't know oh huh yeah and they're they're very expensive too i was gonna well yeah yeah well it doesn't make sense because if they want people to convert you know they should make it worthwhile yeah yeah hum well i'll tell you sometimes it's it's pretty bad here t[oday]- like today i think it was pretty bad i don't know if it was if it's just uh allergies or what but some days it's r[eally]- it's very nice here downtown and other days it's just really bad so i don't know so what what kind of things did you experience in LA when you were there or can you remember were you there at a cause i haven't been there probably yeah well we were there when they had a	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
