agent:right and and you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed in terms of|user:um|user:um-hum	um women don't feel like they need to get married anymore i was twenty seven when	right uh-huh	0
agent:finally to a point where i mean i don't know why i didn't didn't do it sooner but this is probably typical of the women's movement too the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway if you want to go back to school|agent:i'm seriously considering going back to school for law|user:um	um which is a complete i wouldn't say career change it's it's a [vocalized-noise] but it's still is	um-hum	0

agent:and you know tape and bed over that and when it did rain of course the [laughter-only] [laughter-way] to tell if this place leaks is to see if uh what happens after it rains|user:uh-huh|agent:and of course it leaked [laughter] um which is no big deal because they said they'd come fix it well that's true but	you know fixing the tape and bedding to make it look nice again it's it's	it's hard it's hard to make it fit perfectly	1
agent:you can put every[thing]- you know they all look the same they're great big green things they ru[n]- on rollers they're not hard at all even my|agent:you know|user:[noise]	eight and ten year old can do it take them	uh-huh	0

agent:[noise] you know that you kind of i think have to have in your mind an attitude of trading off you just say to yourself well this is not worth it to me to do such and so but i want to make up for it because i want to be real conscientious in this and that you know what i'm saying you|user:uh-huh|user:right	you know all	well i'm	0

user:these children were small you know four or five years old up until they were well into grade school|user:and uh she was paid very well because they the parents trusted them and they you know had done such a good job|user:so um i can see where someone you know in a position like that in a live in capacity would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the finances to be able to do that	well that's true and that's	yeah	0
user:um-hum um-hum i think it takes a l[ot]- i- i don't know i think your patient level mu[st]- needs to increase as the child gets older [laughter] i think that might be part of the problem with some people|user:you know taking care of a baby i know is not an easy thing but when|user:you have them in their their little feet are moving and you have to chase them down constantly i'm sure that's a whole new ball game	oh yeah i got a nine year old i'd trade happily for a babe	[laughter]	1

agent:and uh just don't know or there may be far more there than is ever needed but if it's if it's extra|user:yeah exactly|agent:then she can go to	dental school or any or anything else that	wouldn't that be great	0
agent:and uh companies that do this kind of research hire people to sit there at the at the records office and|agent:take down all this this information and put it into their format so that they can put it on to their computer and and know that a given|user:right	neighborhood is at a given age group they they know a lot about you for the on that one transaction and they know roughly what your income is if you're affording a house of that size so	right	0

user:right|user:and there's so much so so many people on the lower end of those who|user:who are going to be the the drop outs and the	and you worry with you know the effects of	and the poor and the homeless and whatnot	1
user:yeah|user:yeah [laughter]|user:yes i think [laughter-that's] [laughter-true]	and it keeps me from being the old foggy but at the same time it also it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes as to what's come but that's the same i'm home at the summers i'm home with the holidays i'm home at three o'clock when	yeah that's	0
user:uh-huh|agent:and then um and with that it it becomes really easy to make colorful pasta|user:right right	by throwing in some spinach or some tomato or something and mixing it up it it it it's just a snap from there and then you get	uh-huh	0

agent:okay i live i live in Plano so it's north to me|user:okay up here then [laughter] i say down i'm really from Kentucky|agent:[laughter]	i was going to say you didn't have the typical you have a southern accent	uh-huh	0
user:um|agent:and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house so if something breaks we have to shut it off from the main|user:yeah	in the street you know and oh it's it can be really bizarre [laughter] and we never	yeah	0

agent:men [laughter]|user:um|user:um-hum	absolutely and so that's you know they sort of threw the thing back another you know ten years that they've had to you know restructure but i saw the greatest T-shirt the other day i got to get	[laughter]	0
agent:yeah well see that depends on what day of the month it is [laughter]|user:[laughter-yeah]|user:[laughter]	but um i don't know i guess we've gotten more of a [vocalized-noise] in in terms of that i think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other	um-hum	1
user:eight just eight years that's that's a long eight years though|user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh	yeah it has been and um so there have been major major adjustments but that's another story but	uh-huh	0
agent:well you know i think that's that's really i think it depends on what part of the country you're in|user:well that could be|user:um-hum um-hum	um i- i would almost just say that because you know down here in the south [laughter] you know a woman's role is a woman's	oh	0
agent:since the days of the pioneers around here that's the woman's role and it and it's hard for her to|user:[laughter] yeah yeah|user:yeah	um you know -[a]mongst her peers be appreciated i think sometimes but then i'm not there so i don't know that and i have women that	yeah yeah	0

user:but it was an error to|user:to leave like|user:an eighth of an inch or whatever you just put them together as close as you can	as tight as you can that's probably because_1 they had you know every spring my mom says we're going to have a par[ty]- a barbecue and tell everybody guess what we're going to we're going to redo the [laughter-patio] you know we're going to pull	um	0
user:uh-huh|user:yes|user:[laughter]	that was that was on the front door of that house and she has that up in her attic and i have sworn that it i'm going to find a house to put that door on before she [laughter-does] so as far as looking toward the future you know that's my plan i'm going to have to move fast i	[laughter]	0
agent:i don't have that problem is i don't use that argument as saying it's worth keeping one|agent:and the uh NRA's um|agent:claim that the uh the constitutional and the right to bear arms and that whole statement uh it's hard to know the original intent but i- i don't see it as that that difficult of a	story to believe when the opposition says that uh yeah its the right to to arm a militia and as opposed to just the general public and you	right	1
user:input about it you don't know enough|agent:right|user:to know what what to do about some of this stuff	right yeah they're supposed to	i	0

user:oh i see that's good|agent:and i mean it's really clean and but it's|user:uh-huh	it doesn't lose any quality i mean i think sometimes movies try to spice it up a little bit with things unnecessary uh language or nudity or whatever	yeah yeah yeah	1

user:kind of a sad commentary though when you think about it|user:it is|user:right	yeah yeah that uh that that kind of power wa[s]- was was at one time flourishing in this country	right and i[t's]- it's such a valuable tool and and their should be some moral	1
agent:well uh|agent:yeah it's been nice i hope they got what they wanted on it [laughter]|user:well at least you have some some words they can parse there	right okay i'll talk to	take care	0
agent:that's true well you probably i i seem to remember that uh little byline on a lot of things i've read|user:hum|agent:um is is is that um do they have a mail	kind of campaign that they send to professionals in the social no	no we don't uh normally we don't publish uh things under our own imprint uh	1

agent:and you come upon something that you're totally unprepared for uh the first i had gone to a very uh|user:um-hum|agent:um um conservative	uh college and when i started s[chool]- teaching school it was in an inner city situation although it was not Puerto Rican	[laughter]	0
agent:part of that though has been i think uh selected by|agent:by them in that that|user:um-hum	whereas they want the benefits of some of of what the continentals can offer they	um-hum	0

user:like your peers you said you have to if they're going to work it you're going to have to work it too|user:but like a physician it seems like you know they can pretty much|user:work whatever they need as their financial requirements fluctuate	well that tends to be true of of uh anyone who's in business pretty much for themselves uh you	uh-huh	0

agent:li[ke]- it was a Christmas tree that had uh a little trinket for each day|user:oh yes|user:that's uh-huh	that was pinned on the date and then you took it off and put it on the tree so at the end you	well	0
