user:that uh were highly relevant to the case and could i thought have established the defendant's innocence|user:and yeah i think that was just a a horrible miscarriage of justice because of the uh you know staying by the absolute strict rules and not allowing things to be presented to the jury|agent:uh-huh	yeah	0
user:yeah that's something i thought would be a very good idea of when juries come in they are told just to shut up and listen|agent:i don't know that i want to sit on a jury like that and you'd still you know i want ask some questions here [laughter]|user:uh-huh i think so and uh and	uh-huh	0

user:um-hum|agent:accounts that were these you know savings and loans and stuff right|agent:reimbursing this is going to be a substantial cost the banks are failing because of all their	um so i mean this things just got to spread	0
user:and people|user:yeah i i came fr[om]- out here to California from Texas and i can very well remember people trying to change the Texas legislature to meet every year instead of every other year as the Texas constitution requires|agent:hm	hm	0

agent:are the ties|user:no i ultimate [noise] leave and i haven't been at work in awhile so i i don't really know|agent:your work without saying much about it do they ever bring the subject up of asking your opinion on on whether you want things to change on how you dress or	oh	0
user:[laughter] so you see|agent:oh no|user:so we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do uh he wants to do that's satisfactory and we've been here seven months and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently	that throws the budget out of whack real fast	0
user:until our k[ids]- children went to college so|agent:yeah|user:we spent too much money	yeah	1
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:well uh but i do realize that that is realistic for some people and it was for us many year[s]- for many years uh and if	yeah	1

agent:that's right|agent:that's right|user:i think it's important that they do get away you know [vocalized-noise] not necessarily so far that you can't get to them_1 but at least you know a hundred miles or or even two hundred miles where you can at least go down there on a on a like a month a one month basis or they can come home	yeah yeah that's	0

user:they get bombarded with junk and they don't have to do anything around the house they never learned to be responsible when the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while and they come back and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad|user:one of the reasons i guess is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working|user:nowadays it's not the case kids don't kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk and	yeah	2
user:why they don't talk about it i mean they don't bring it up at all why you would think they'd be real having a real campaign with one party or the other|user:i'm amazed that n[either]- neither party or or the which i guess they're independent parties too|user:right	right yeah	0
agent:will raise them but but it will all it the money will not help anything that's what kills me um [noise] you know the for instance here here in Texas they're talking about uh an income tax|user:right|agent:doesn't isn't realistic about what he see you know what he's doing the guy who says well we should raise taxes	well i could almost support an income tax if they reduced or got rid of the sales tax	0
agent:yeah|user:our government uh rotating you know keep them moving uh and not get the career politicians huh|user:maybe that long-term though i think that is a a factor that is to keep the	right	0
user:and then of course we have a home so it's|user:yeah|agent:really	i know	2
user:sometimes [laughter-i'll] [laughter-do] the same thing|user:uh doing something like an afghan if i'm close to the end|user:even if i'm	uh-huh	0

user:do you like your job|agent:no|user:that's not bad at all	[laughter-sometimes]	0
user:it's scary though i'm telling you|agent:yeah|user:oh well that's good at least they kept the business part of it	i know	1
agent:you know|agent:i don't know i it's that just might not be something that everybody wants to do i mean there are a lot of people who would like to do it and there are a lot of people who get into other things and they get all involved and they just|agent:well	don't want to or don't have the time	1
agent:and that was|agent:i see|user:the minimum wage	that was some [vocalized-noise] some some program where people gave their time	2
user:i don't know|agent:that it you know that they would have enough|agent:all right i wonder if if they didn't make it mandatory if they would actually get enough people volunteering t[o]- t[o]- to do it	i mean i	0
user:start when|user:oh okay so|agent:in some cases that's what we ought to do	not {Reaganomics} thank you	0
agent:then|agent:minimum wage|agent:lower the amount they make and raise the amount of true minimum wage jobs not those that are affected by the federal	more people will get off welfare	1
user:um-hum|agent:costs the company|agent:and operate within the government guidelines	a huge amount of money	2
user:yeah|user:federal|agent:now that's something i would love to see happen not only in all the states but in the federal legislatures too	two terms then they got to sit out one	2
user:all the time [noise] so|user:you know he'll slap at him and hiss at him and everything and the cat stays in|agent:[laughter]	uh-huh	2
agent:um-hum|user:it was like a cat it stayed in the house all the time and it used a litter box|user:it was pretty interesting and	yeah	0
agent:as it turns out we don't really have a|agent:so|agent:then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system	tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it	1
user:uh would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of Baltimore County here in Maryland|user:uh whole county now i- i know the concept of counties in Texas is quite a bit different than it is here in Maryland uh like Collin County|user:and so it it works out nice it it it makes it so that the	oh yeah	0
user:yeah well they they've been having some problems uh even here in uh like Baltimore City which is a a pretty good ci[ty]- goo[d]- good sized city|agent:no where near perfect but they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it|agent:so you know our school system down here is	yeah	0

user:um-hum|agent:have to you know use child care at least for a couple hours a day|agent:because_1 i hate to see that i mean probably ninety percent of the people that work for me are single parents and they	so i don't know i- i really think a big company needs to take responsibility for that	1
agent:you know|agent:and luckily my boss has maybe you know allowed me to work it off but a lot of people you know go in the hole and uh take|agent:yeah	weeks without pay and it's tough	0
user:oh okay well then i guess that's makes a difference|agent:ours is only up to four percent though|user:yeah for up to ten percent of your salary	[laughter-yeah]	0
user:would have qualified|agent:uh-huh|user:center there so we were still in college and had she not worked there i'm not sure that i	[laughter]	0
user:the national credit card syndrome of just putting everything on there|user:i guess over the years tried to avoid|user:uh i	uh-huh	2
