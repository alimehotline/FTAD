agent:that's right|user:i guess that's a risk you have to take|agent:well you can reduce that risk by uh having the car checked out	i mean you know y[ou]- y[ou]- if you're going to look at fifty different cars you don't want to do this but if you've	um-hum	0
agent:oh yeah i think i would [laughter-too]|agent:because_1 you know even|agent:i have to drive seventy five every day	so i [laughter] i do i drive	ooh [laughter]	0
agent:segment that he said that if the money tha[t]- that goes into welfare each year|agent:was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in in the government bureaucracy each person would receive like forty five thousand dollars|user:um-hum	i mean i was astounded i don't even make	yeah	1

user:[laughter]|agent:that was a sh[ock]- the he put the phone down pretty quickly and it didn't take him long to extricate|user:[laughter]	my hand but oh i was scared to death i i i could see him cutting	[noise] that's hilarious	0

agent:well at i the the the generations that are being raised now by working mothers i i are are a little more in touch with|user:yeah|agent:the household chores and duties and what has to be done so i think	over a couple of generations time it will all change because it's	yeah i	1
user:uh-huh|user:is that right|agent:so a woman president would be	laughed at by other countries because they wouldn't respect	nope	0
user:and that's probably another cause of the problem we are looking at right now|agent:yeah it's it it there's just it just seemed like everybody and their brother had a savings and loan [laughter]|user:this is a very true thing i didn't think about that part of it	you know because you know i have never i'm uh we're originally from Missouri and there are you know mostly banks and maybe a couple of savings and loans in the area i mean i have never seen	uh-huh	0
user:and if this guy is exempt from paying it we have to pay more|agent:we got to take up slack|user:that's exactly right	and so it's it's it's a	so it's just	0

agent:yeah|user:but uh at least there isn't|user:at least [vocalized-noise] i feel like i got rid of something	[laughter-yeah] [laughter]	hurricanes so	1
user:problem but is it|agent:well i mean it it it is a fact uh|agent:the the CFC's do act like i mean it it it's it's like	a billiard ball you get a CFC up there high enough you know it's a it's in the ozone layer	um-hum	0
user:where it became no longer a problem|user:then maybe you know you could let the rules relax somewhat but|user:um-hum um-hum	well now just stop and think of of um um NASA for example all the people who work for NASA are uh of course	um-hum	0
user:um-hum um-hum|user:uh-huh|user:um-hum	doing nothing but resolving problems with schools that were assigned to me that couldn't be resolved on a local level which could be a complaint on a principal or a teacher or a riot a bus action stabbing taking parents to court kids to	um	0
agent:i think so uh i i see nothing wrong with that i think that that it should be uh better accepted than um uh forced testing of everyone|user:uh-huh uh-huh|user:uh-huh	uh it uh perhaps people would accept it better and then they	um-hum	0
user:uh i think that uh that a player ought to hit a home run if he's got the pitch to do it but when you get two strikes on you you have a tend[ency]- you know you should you know shorten your swing a little bit you know if it's a perfect shot go for it but i mean you know the strike outs were a big problem for him|user:and uh plus supposedly what i heard he was not much of a team player anyway so|agent:well it it's an interesting concept though when you look at uh of of how baseball how apparently i was reading in the paper tonight that the Detroit Tigers are going to sign him	and uh and the point of of i- i guess i don't understand the the strategy of how baseball works but it seems that you know they can sign him tomorrow and he could go in the team	um-hum	0
user:because_1 uh i guess we don't trust the school systems which is really sad um but|agent:exactly|user:[vocalized-noise] but it if it doesn't start at home it's not gonna go anywhere	right that's true	uh	1
agent:right|user:and it's always a potluck everybody brings food|agent:yeah yeah	seems to me well the the the uh main event of course is the meal [laughter] at the	right [laughter]	0

user:i don't think we'd need a whole church but um|user:the problem is we are all really scattered around there isn't any one place where most of us live so if we ever had a reunion we'd kind of all have to stay in a hotel i mean|user:you know there'd be one person who lived there that would have a house but they couldn't put everybody up so it i think it would get kind of expensive	but you know what you can do at a	um	0

user:right and i think that's a good idea|agent:you know|user:that's right	yeah and the kids don't care my kid doesn't care he picks up	i know	0

agent:it [laughter-does] forever|user:it [laughter] it lasts a long time|user:[laughter]	and then when you get through with your own you've got grandchildren so [laughter] it's not ending is it [laughter] you think we've talked a	[laughter]	0

user:converter yeah um-hum|agent:and no lead gas was came to the pumps and and that's been done there's the lead pollution has that problem|user:um-hum	essentially i guess because it was at crisis proportions was was licked and i think that there are th[ere]- there are solutions certainly we don't even need	and that uh for buses	0
agent:but uh again uh that didn't occur without a crisis nothing will occur i guess without a crisis|user:i mean even California was notorious for its smog years ago before it even was an issue|agent:yeah exactly	exactly	out here	1

user:yeah|user:uh-huh|user:that's true	i guess it's it's worse you know i'd rather s[ee]- be able s[ee]- to control my money as much as i do with what's left over after taxes than to live in oh England or um some some countries where so much of it is socialized that you don't see any of that money at all and so you know i guess it's all relative [laughter]	[laughter] it's how you look at it too [laughter]	1
