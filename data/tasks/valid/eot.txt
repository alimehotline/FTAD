agent:yeah|user:[noise] okay|agent:okay was good talking to you	all right	0
user:uh permits you know for that place and that there's you know limits as to what we can|user:that facility will not generate air pollutants from what i've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up and that we won't be polluting the air i'm sure we have to have|agent:very	uh let you know go into the air	1
agent:uh|agent:uh everybody has your home phone number type of job|user:hm	now is that place built or you're still in the makings of it	1
agent:possibly|user:just letting it go in the ground because_1 eventually you know i[t]- it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined uh dump area it still only in time starts to leak out|user:certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the Sherman facility than um	yeah	0
agent:exactly i've enjoyed speaking with you|agent:i've enjoy[ed]-|user:right right not just overhead [laughter]	you too	0
user:but on the other hand you know i i've|agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:well i was i was thinking [laughter-about] that too i mean uh we don't have any suitable replacement for Freon and y[ou]- and you have to have it for refrigeration so	um i took a boat cruise one time	0
agent:uh that's why|user:yeah|agent:Freon's uh Freon is in a closed circuit	yeah	1
user:cooperating with the Canadians on the acid rain problem|user:all that kind of stuff uh|user:i i'm more worried about the ozone than i am anything else i i i think we're getting a handle on sulfur dioxides and	but the ozone i mean you know we can't replace that [laughter]	0
user:it's uh|user:yeah that's right when i was a kid i used to do the same thing|user:yeah	i- i don't kn[ow]- i don't know what the rain forests have to do with it but you know they're chopping those down at a tremendous rate everyday	1
agent:and it they got their water from this uh beautiful mountain river|user:um-hum|agent:it's uh some kind of a bacteria call[ed]- or carried by animals	um-hum	1
user:well that's scary|user:jeez|user:[noise]	i it it worries me to turn on the turn on the taps now because_1 you never know what's gonna come out	0
user:and they s[ay]- s[ay]- -[y]eah it's getting better it's getting better and then you turn around and you look and places like Los Angeles is s[till]- still so thick you have to cut it with a knife|user:right that's about what they say about the the air pollution in this country|agent:uh yeah	i don't know	1
agent:no they did away with it because they found out that uh|user:yeah they don't do it anymore|agent:uh they used to do it down in Florida now i lived down there for ten years	yeah	1
agent:uh diesel engines are uh|agent:well now here's another thing diesels|user:[laughter-you] [laughter-know]	[noise]	1
user:um|user:cold w[eather]-|agent:well i um i i had good luck with mine until it finally just blew up on me here a few weeks ago	yeah i had a friend of mine had a uh had a Buick had had a diesel in it and he had nothing but trouble with the thing	0
agent:well now course in California they're they have much stricter codes than we have elsewhere|user:less polluting|user:but speaking of cars [noise] what more can we do to cars to make them_1	yeah	1
agent:so i i- predominantly wear flat shoes um you know in the winter i wear sweaters in the summer i you know i like one piece dresses short sleeves things like that|user:yeah|agent:i um don't like to wear heels that really tires me out i work in a big building	i've recently um t[ried]- tried to update my wardrobe trying to put	0
agent:yeah well they're um you know they're like Ber[muda]- yeah they're like black corduroy Ber[muda]- Bermuda shorts and sometimes i wear a blazer with them and i get really a lot of compliments on them|user:it's nice you can wear shorts especially on a day like today when it's so hot|user:yeah	dress shorts	1
agent:uh-huh well see i live in Virginia|user:and i have a closet full of sweaters|user:um we moved from Colorado where	that	1
agent:yeah we're still pretty much you know in winter as far as that goes here|agent:um-hum|user:definitely a shorts day around here	[noise] this is pretty uns[easonal]- unseasonal but	0
agent:oh yeah|user:pop-up trailer|user:but uh my family used to have a	and we'd go camping to a lot of different places we spent two weeks in Bastrop Texas once	1
agent:[laughter]|agent:oh yeah|user:doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me uh my friend said that the last time they went uh she just got tired of the tent and it was cold at night and she got tired of eating out of cans and so they stayed in a hotel one night	just for fun	1
agent:oh that's miserable|user:couldn't even go out of the camper the wind was blowing so hard because you'd get sand in your eyes|user:and there were some pretty big dunes before the the camping area and the sand was all blowing up and	yeah it was pretty bad	0
agent:that's nice you know paying five or six dollars instead of forty [laughter]|user:oh yeah|agent:because_1 my our family lives in Missouri and uh when we take trips home we take our pop-up with us in good weather and stay overnight at a state park or something so we don't have to rent a hotel room and that's	yeah	0
user:and uh|user:probably one of the best things about it was the scenery|user:yeah i've seen that that's uh that was a really good movie	i thought the story was pretty good too i th[ink]- i think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it	1
agent:well the interesting thing was is i had heard that and i- i- i tend to i think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great and and|user:it i think it's been nominated for twelve awards and and all the critics initially said that you know it wouldn't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud so it it has surprised everybody|user:that's true i agree with that um i- i noticed yesterday in the paper something said that	uh-huh	1
user:it's suspenseful i don't think it's very t[error]- i mean there's not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that it's it's more suspense|agent:or is it just suspenseful|user:[noise]	um [noise] the other one Silence of the Lambs is kind of a a gory movie if if somebody's not into that kind of stuff it's it's pretty graphic at points but uh i think they're both excellent movies	1
user:i think that i think he did a good job and and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much|user:whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office i think he would have been happy because|user:you know he he enjoyed the story line and i think he just really w[anted]- he really wanted it whether it	greater than any awards that they can give him	1
EMPTY	[noise]	1
agent:typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang and it's TI calling my immediate reaction is th[at]- -[i]t's some sort of strange phone message and then i realize oh no this is something i solicited|agent:i i think i agree with that i think in a good example on the|user:obviously everyday	[laughter-that's] [laughter-right]	1
agent:because uh some sense of of the way the ritual is played out|user:um-hum|agent:and i think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control and you one's feeling obligated	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:cou[ld]- good possibility that their facts were were fantasy|agent:i would find that there'd be|agent:that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:right|user:you know full cash price|agent:right right	for it i mean you know you can't tell what what a company really has to do with it and there's something rather ominous about having	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and people would leave me alone|agent:uh-huh	whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and act like the lunatic you you violate the uh the norms of socia[l]- of um public behavior	0
user:because_1 anyone can be alone for oh some period of time but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that|agent:yes|user:i assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy	there's this invisible barrier around me which people will re[spect]- will respect	0
agent:pardon me|user:where am i calling|agent:yeah me too	where are you	1
user:that's right|agent:that's true|agent:pardon me	but just because we've got a lot of money doesn't mean that's gonna solve the problem	1
agent:yeah|user:so just distribute it equally|agent:and it's gonna be a real bad mess because there's people on every side of the problem	and not raise taxes	1
agent:no it didn't|user:but didn't they pass that thing that we were gonna have a lottery or not|agent:because_1 when you bring	oh	1
agent:hum-um|user:i don't even know how they figure it really|agent:places like in Lewisville it's a lot closer to seven	i'm glad i don't work in a store	1
agent:uh well for like on the welfare system if they gave|agent:if they uh|agent:uh for the for the federal government at least that	[noise]	1
agent:wow|user:yeah and you give them_1 you know they get their free lunch and they throw most of it away but then they have their money to go buy dessert and that they eat|agent:well i don't have that [laughter] a lot of times if i've got a dollar in my wallet it's like boy where do i g[o]- where did where'd i find [laughter-that]	you know it's just you see garbage pans i mean pails just filled and we pay people to haul them off right	1
agent:you know they should do more background search on you they should i think it should be harder to buy one|agent:a[nd]- but i think there should be some [vocalized-noise] restrictions when you buy one|user:right	yeah there's a lot of crazies out there that can just go in and buy a gun	0
user:[laughter]|agent:and they're illegal [laughter-so] i don't think it would do us any good to outlaw them all together|user:right	no i yeah i- i- i- i- i agree that it would be like	0
agent:yeah okay [laughter] thanks|user:y[eah]- yeah we just say good-bye and hang up okay [laughter-okay]|agent:i think we just hang up	okay thanks bye-bye [noise]	1
agent:um-hum|agent:[laughter]|user:and you're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the cli[ck]- as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on	or you hear somebody already starting r[eading]- reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already	1
user:that's about|agent:let me see|agent:i agree with you on that particular subject there	that as far as any other everyday occurrences	1
agent:[laughter] oh gosh|user:wonder if there'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it'd be harassment|agent:oh goodness	but i consider invasion of my privacy	1
agent:and we're in our second home now|user:oh boy|agent:well i've lived in the in the Dallas and Richardson area for about uh twenty five and a half years twenty six years	uh-huh	1
user:that's what brought us here and um|user:graduated from school in Houston uh my husband w[ent]- went to school at Rice and got his PhD so that|user:well we uh when we	we had um	1
agent:and they have sold a house that was quite expensive and bought one you know that was was more reasonably priced|agent:yesterday uh or you know over the last couple of days|agent:but uh i guess i'm i'm a little encouraged with home prices i i'm a CPA and i was just talking to one of my clients uh	um-hum	1
agent:in that area of the house|agent:that that shifting would cause some problems in that|agent:any shifting in the foundation of course or or you know i guess i feel that way anyway that	yes	1
agent:and makes it more uh s[table]- more stable and and puts more strength into it|agent:to that iron bar which compresses the concrete|agent:and once they get the foundation poured then they they apply tension	um-hum	1
user:my parents always lived in houses that he built and then they knew|user:my grandfather was a builder and so|agent:[noise]	they were getting a good deal	0
user:oh|agent:-[i]t's kind of an easy thing to talk about|agent:yeah [laughter]	i guess the work force would be the main wouldn't it	0
agent:look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman i think that would be the best|agent:hopefully the next generation it won't even be an issue i mean people will just|agent:yeah	yes	0
agent:you know what's it called job sharing like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job|agent:also with uh women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as|agent:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:yeah especially_1 with children and so many things going on|agent:oh that's wonderful|user:um-hum yeah we get the full benefits but we've just really got a wonderful system that	we're working under yeah	1
agent:[noise] i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making you know when that subject comes up they can say yes that would be wonderful|agent:yeah|user:yes i think it's great i really and i look for more of that in the next generation	um-hum	1
agent:but i know|user:um-hum|agent:uh-huh i guess i take it for granted kind of because_1 i just it's always been that way	yeah but i can remem[ber]- remember back growing up my mother i mean it was she always worked but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off	1
agent:[noise] uh yeah currently we have a poodle|user:[noise]	uh do you have a pet Randy	1

agent:yeah well i i don't really have anything against rap music i d[o]- the one thing i do object to about rap music is is i[t]-|agent:rap|user:how do you feel about rap music it seems to be so popular these days	um-hum	1
user:sounds th[e]- sounds so much different and yet i i have a a much younger sister who listens to a a lot of rap music and|agent:yeah|user:and uh	uh she thinks it's	0
user:maybe so i|agent:like a John Lee Hooker song or something i mean it was like it was really old|agent:yeah i don't know it may've it may've been somebody else because i th[ink]- i think that even Jimi Hendrix did a i think that was a cov[er]- i you know come to think of it i think that was a cover version of	i can't think	1
agent:um the the album oriented like the uh James Taylor and|agent:with a lot of the AOR type music|user:um-hum	oh yeah	1

user:i don't have any of them_1 i don't carry them_1 he carries them_1|agent:uh but uh i seem too rely on them too much|agent:believe that uh mine would say the same	i try to take them_1 away from him	1
agent:oh uh-huh|user:ATM machine|user:well no he doesn't have that trouble he uh has this little slip that comes out with the uh	and he just keeps that he keeps fairly decent records	1
agent:you know you get out on a shopping s[pree]- frenzy and uh just charge it all and then you don't have to write a check or anything|agent:oh it's it's real easy to get addicted to them|agent:[laughter]	and see the thing is you know he go out and he'll spend it when he wants you know and uh	0
agent:you don't care how much it costs or what it takes|agent:you know you you always want to get your kids everything and uh|agent:oh yeah there's that's a weakness there that's just	yeah well uh	1

user:yeah|agent:you know i think if somebody wants to say -[o]kay read these ten books because_1 these are self-improvements i would probably be turned off to them_1|agent:but as you say it's it's sometimes it's difficult to to know if it's	yeah	1
agent:the the airways of th[e]-|agent:the the|agent:that's almost everything that comes across the	oh yeah you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other	0
EMPTY	all right Amy how are you doing today	1
agent:really what is that|agent:yeah|user:in public places there is one state that does that by the way	i want to say Oklahoma i saw re[port]- something the other night about it	0
agent:yeah|user:life in prison then he's available for parole if it's if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole|user:a[nd]- a[nd]- a[nd]- and and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to	so what you know let's quit BSing with the system	1
user:[noise] [noise] the the judge presently has an opportunity to|agent:um-hum|user:about the issue about sentencing by the judge	intervene	0

agent:yeah yeah|user:this is true|agent:oh they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it [laughter-practically]	so true well	1
agent:y[eah]-|user:and i get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day it always seems like i'm doing that and i can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry you know boxes of documents around so if i'm just gonna be there working in the litigation center and doing you know odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents i dress down but if we're going to have a meeting where we're having the attorneys come in or people from uh other party's attorneys and stuff then i normally dress up|agent:yeah	yeah and i'll wear a dress and hose and stuff	1
user:[laughter] yeah|agent:oh how awful sounds like Mister Power Hungry [laughter] but you know just yesterday though i saw a girl in the spin out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts and i don't care you can call them_1 split skirts and you can call them_1 culottes all you want but these were shorts is all they were i mean i- i don't care what else you call them_1 you know if they're below the knee okay maybe you can call them_1 split skirts if they're above the knee they turn into shorts you know|user:he didn't at least say to us did you know you're not supposed to do that that could have alleviated a big [laughter-problem] we ended up getting called out on it [laughter]	uh-huh	1
agent:uh yeah and then during the week you see these women in the you know just because you put on a pair of hose with them_1 doesn't make them_1 not shorts anymore you know|user:and they have said no [laughter]|agent:yeah	yeah	1
agent:that's the way to do it i mean that's the smart way to do it it really is because your making you know if when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in you know in a six hundred dollar three piece suit it's gonna make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable you [laughter-know] [laughter] or it would me you [laughter-know]|agent:yeah|agent:[laughter]	yeah	1

agent:okay|user:um yeah i think it's a territory|agent:is that what it's called a territory	that makes sense	1
user:[vocalized-noise] where as|agent:[laughter] My dad was stationed in Guam during the World War Two though|user:it's definitely a way out of the way where	uh-huh	1
agent:[laughter]|agent:[vocalized-noise]|agent:you think	i don't know if that's uh	1
agent:oh okay|user:yeah this is this is actually the first time i've i've had someone call me so [noise]|agent:don't they	but uh	1
agent:do you do you think that that we should have given up the Panama Canal|user:and i did live in uh Sao Paulo Brazil for four years|user:Latin America i kind of i consider Latin America to include Central and South America	uh r[ealistically]- realistically	0
user:expert on the on the region but uh|user:i i have a a little bit i can't say that i'm i i would be an|agent:will you uh d[id]- did you ever studied the the political makeup there in in in Nicaragua	certainly uh	1
user:what seem what seems to be popular support|user:under|user:the government in power that	uh Sandinistas had	0
user:inf[luence]- Soviet influence in in what's considered to be the United States' fear|user:not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about the|user:uh agree with the or	of the world which is not only	0
user:and on to their detriment they came from uh this|user:i[f]- y[ou]- p[retty]- if you look at the region and|user:yeah oh you can look in	uh	0
user:they make the things that Custer did look like uh|user:uh the native tribes i mean they make uh|user:then the the conquistadors coming in and and the who[le]- the incredibly horrible things they did to the	like trivial and uh you get	1
agent:you know would they be better off under communism|agent:uh the question is would they|agent:uh surviving	yeah	1
agent:to uh where he's got something to protect other you know whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest to him|agent:if he's got uh you know i[f]- if he if he can raise enough uh coffee and bananas|agent:yeah if the guys got some incentive	right	1
agent:of course|user:yeah uh it's tempting it's got to be it's got be horribly tempting for those|agent:[laughter] of course	for those	1
user:as a matter of fact i prefer|agent:wouldn't you know [laughter]|agent:well	public television	1
agent:of regular TV|agent:the sitcoms|agent:uh challenging you know than	well unfortunately	0
agent:me too|user:in in that regard|agent:uh-huh yeah	but uh	1
agent:yeah|user:appearance of Roger Moore as 007|agent:yeah	so it it	1
user:the series uh|agent:uh-huh|user:[vocalized-noise] with you know PBS and so forth and i i particularly enjoy i don't know whether you've whether you had a chance to watch it on PBS but uh	Yes Minister	1
user:i read about|user:as i said and uh quite a bit i|agent:uh-huh	two or three novels a week	1
agent:how'd you hear oh we're not even supposed to be talking about this though are we|user:in Maryland yes|agent:really	well that i guess it it doe[sn't]-	0
user:uh|agent:uh-huh|user:well no that's it you could interpret it that way	i think	1
user:that so much was lost in the translation|user:translation|agent:[noise]	uh particularly since most of the tr[anslations]- most of the translations were from Greek	1
user:fact involved just from the|agent:uh-huh|user:one might interpret the Bible now and what it says so that you know it's it you know you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true but there's too much historical	uh the histories that are that were developed around that time that are available	0
user:but uh i|agent:really|agent:uh-huh	as as far as that goes i a[t]- we at we at least agree on you know on what we enjoy in that regard	0
user:well i'm i guess|agent:what is your situation|agent:one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or or let it go one or the other	i don't have su[ch]- such close experience with with um	0
user:and so um|agent:oh that's very interesting|user:i have been to Puerto Rico and and found it very very interesting i did Peace Corps training there	you know i saw it	0
user:well probably more on in terms of the US|agent:economies was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on on Puerto Rico or pressures on the US in terms of aid or|agent:your concern on the	um	0
user:um|user:like New York and and how much aid it needs i suppose the whole country or the whole|user:um i guess you know we'd have a lot of aid if if you consider the inner cities of	new state would require such aid	1
user:um|user:probably freer to determine their own|user:they also not being a state are	ways of life than they would if if	1
user:it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want|user:so if they've just taken such action|agent:um-hum	to declare this before they become a state	0
agent:i'm troubled even in by bilingualism uh in so far as that it intr[udes]- it gets in the way of of of the melting pot aspect|agent:um|agent:a a negative step to make and i think that that they would need to reassess that	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:but i'm rather in favor of people being bilingual and i'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language|agent:yeah|user:and so obviously it didn't work in California	right	1
agent:for a kinesiology program there|agent:and um is going to be uh entering North Texas|user:uh-huh	um-hum	1
agent:um-hum|user:like um i've never done aerobics or any sort of structured this is my exercise time|user:very often do things for the sake of exercise i don't feel well unless i am exercising and i try to do things that involve exercise but i very rarely do things	but i do lots of outdoor sports and things	0
agent:you know a a calc[ulated]- you know calculated down and and do your calisthenics you know three times a week or|user:um-hum um-hum|agent:y[ou]- you know just sitting and doing you know to the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something you know to	um-hum	1
user:um-hum um-hum|agent:just get out you know out and about and it's it it's something you can all like our we did it as a family so it was|agent:um	um-hum	1
user:you know for all i know aerobics started out here i don't know where they actually started but they you know the craze really picked up big here|user:but in urban California it's just|user:uh an older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that i'm i'm i'm i'm not uh there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness and and at least in urban California and maybe not i don't know about rural California too well	and before that there was the running craze and they California gets you know tends to be a bit faddish but	0
user:and it doesn't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything it it's|agent:um-hum|user:oh the Uni[versity]- Uni[versity]- Uni[versity]- the University of California at Berkeley puts out The Wellness Letter which is uh turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that and	on	0
user:yeah yeah exactly and part of it is California you know in back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements and some of them fizzled out and some of them were disastrous and others of them|user:and s[ome]-|user:yeah	um had an impact on the society around here and one of the ones that had an impact was	1
user:the irony is is it's people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented|user:and uh and exercise is is strongly considered one of them|agent:um-hum	towards	0
user:they seem pretty you know they don't have the hard body|user:and|agent:um-hum	they don't have that perfect look and an awful lot of exercises is sort of image conscious but they you know they live to a hundred and ten some day [laughter-you] [laughter-know]	0
agent:well of course in the cities yeah well in the cities we live close to Dallas so|user:i was wondering that because i was actually applying for a job in Texas and and and uh|user:you can	it occurred to me	1
user:uh [vocalized-noise] we've had a lot more warm weather than usual and we haven't had any ice storms|user:i guess we're um uh we're we're experiencing uh what to me i guess is a surprisingly mild uh winter	uh usually we have at least one	0
agent:permanently or full time since nineteen eighty|agent:well i have been here|user:right that's right it's it's the same way here how long have you lived in Lubbock	uh-huh	1
user:[noise] and we got here and we just couldn't believe how warm it was i mean it was in the fifties and we were taking off our winter coats and we were all dressed like Eskimos|agent:um-hum|user:where it was snowing	and uh and then soon after we had this big ice storm	0
agent:okay|user:if you get any snow it's barely enough to hide the brown grass|user:w[ell]- it	you know and uh certainly nothing that you have to do anything about	0
agent:but it's not six feet of snow and it doesn't stay on the ground six months out of the year and i know the sun is coming [laughter]|user:yeah|user:right	right	1
agent:well now when did winter start there you said you had more winter than summer|user:and d[ay]- day before yesterday it got up to eighty eight i think|agent:yeah	[noise] oh winter would start oh yeah winter would start uh in September it would start getting cold in September	1
agent:well now do you work at TI i was gonna say there've been several times when i know they had ice storms down in Dallas|user:uh storm and the place closes up|agent:yeah	yes uh-huh	1
agent:of a winter up there i could truly love|agent:and now that part|user:yeah	yeah	0
agent:you know if there's a breeze blowing it's a nice comfortable day and you don't feel like you have to take ten showers a day because you you take a shower and walk outside and the humidity's so great you know you're sweating to death again|user:okay|user:yeah	oh	1
user:uh we've gotten a little Atari computer uh husband describes it as a|agent:i work with computers at work and then i come home and d[o]- and i have uh a little lap top at home that i just like to play with|agent:i uh	a computer with training wheels	1
user:and uh when you pull it out it's called bisque|agent:um-hum|user:you know it's like a big [ogen/oven] oven	uh it started it off with greenware	1
user:no i liked it i had fun with it but uh you know uh|agent:well that doesn't sound very expensive to me|user:was co[st]- cost me about eight dollars	i'm a little shaky when it comes to detail work	0
agent:uh-huh|user:the people on ESPN|agent:excuse me	i workout with them or try to	1
agent:yeah|user:and uh|user:and uh few times we've had a tie breaker so i played three games	then we'll get a half hour break or so and then i'll go and play another set with somebody else you know	1

agent:yes bu[t]- it wasn't quite business but to give the the students um an made you feel like you were the authority i felt like if i came in just in jeans or|user:somewhat business attire yeah|agent:you know [vocalized-noise]	right	1
user:and uh the senior vice president is uh|agent:um-hum|user:not really it's uh it's just uh in our small group we uh we have a controller and uh we support a senior vice president	is big on business attire and so um	0
user:vice president i feel i just have that l[ittle]- little extra confidence in myself|user:and uh if i do have to approach the uh the controller or the|agent:um-hum um-hum	being dressed that way	1
agent:well and i i noticed since we moved down here to Texas my husband is originally from Texas but uh i'm not and|agent:um-hum|user:it it does like you were saying the the way you dress makes you feel different ways um if you like when you go out at night uh you may just want to have a casual evening or something so y[ou]- you sort of dress down but if you're going to a uh a social type party then you dress up and that i think it just has a a change on your attitude	i see	1
agent:the color certain colors seem to be more acceptable|agent:that's really true a lot of it is um|agent:um-hum	true	1
agent:a white dinner jacket or [laughter-something] [laughter-and] so you can only wear a white dinner jacket between those|user:right|user:yeah [laughter]	i see right	1

agent:you know|user:so you're you're kind of thinking|user:hum	in other words if you get if you do something the first time that's not real bad you know	1
user:no apparently not because_1 look how many years they've been doing that and look [laughter] i mean|agent:you know putting them_1 in prison my God that doesn't work|agent:but	yeah	1
agent:because that's what our society becomes i mean we have|user:um-hum|agent:you know we are what we teach	comes yeah	1
user:and i it really is i'm like you astonishing what the younger ages know and they react to what they see at home You know|user:you know that's huh-uh but something i do|agent:um-hum	if they see violence at home that's what you're going to	0
agent:they made a position for them_1 some where|agent:if they weren't fit for the job they were hired for they didn't just can them_1|agent:took it upon itself to find a position for these people	huh uh-huh	1

agent:and welcome to Texas|user:[laughter] yeah so have i|agent:done to solve any of this [laughter] but i've enjoyed talking with you	oh	1
user:and|user:and it's a real challenge to find foods proper foods to eat|user:well we're vegetarians and we just became vegetarians for i i just became a vegetarian over the past uh year and a half	it's a real challenge not to become like what they call a junk food junkie where your menu is composed of	0
user:but i do sometimes when i smell meat you know when i smell particularly|agent:um-hum|user:so it i can't do it you know f[or]- for me it's it just	uh say steak or something you know that i- i do admit that i	1

user:so although you can i mean there's cookbooks and there's ways to do it it's a lot more expensive too i think you know the the the market is just not made for a vegan so|agent:yeah|user:a[nd]- eggs yeah eggs my mother just said eggs it's hard to find substitutes for eggs when you're baking and cooking and things	but um	1
user:so|user:horrible but there's a lot of things you can buy that have soybean products in them to begin with that you don't even know where in there|agent:uh-huh um-hum	um	1

user:pretty famous restaurant out of New York and almost every single recipe in there|user:uh it's out of New York it's a|user:and	is um	0
user:that meats|user:you know and and when you read so much information that tells you|agent:[laughter]	and different animal products you know are causing uh can cause uh different kinds of diseases	0
user:i think you'd feel probably a lot healthier um [vocalized-noise] my a[lmost]- almost everyone in my family is is obese|agent:and i'm terribly overweight i'm obese probably is the word i've never used that word on myself before but i am very large and probably if i could give up the meat products and just get on vegetables i would probably look a lot better|user:so you it's it's all important you know it's an all important thing that you	yeah i- i would say you know th[e]- almost everyone and uh	0
user:well why was CNN the on[ly]- of course i think|user:uh-huh|agent:i watched a lot of CNN because it was so good	Saddam Hussein only allowed CNN to	0
agent:[vocalized-noise] um-hum|user:well i listen to a Christian radio station|user:uh why CNN was	and they were saying that CNN is definitely a world	1
user:and i was watching on TV they they broadcast this|agent:um-hum|user:uh tour sort of thing	terrible riot supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem	0
agent:uh in these earthquakes and i mean they were they were very minor kinds of things|agent:but uh i c[an]- i'm from California and i can remember being in|user:right right	yeah	1
user:huh-uh i have find it hard to uh follow from one page to another it's just something i've never developed uh|agent:don't you how come|user:uh we have the Dallas Times Herald and the Dallas Morning News but i don't i don't read [laughter-newspapers]	an interest in	1
user:huh|agent:i work out here|agent:but i grew up in LA	you work for TI	1
user:minutes|agent:i see|user:yeah well i'd i got into a conversation last night with a lady and they interrupt at ten	so if we've done our three minutes	0
agent:oh well you're on the uh lets see|user:yeah i'm in North Carolina|agent:really	on the other coast [laughter]	1
agent:yeah so it it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway kind of quaint little towns but they don't have a whole lot there|user:like Chapel Hill|agent:uh-huh	yeah	0
agent:probably not see i'm in the Navy|user:so are are you going to go for your doctorate|agent:i don't lose any sleep sleep over stuff like that	yeah	1
user:and um|agent:uh-huh|agent:[noise]	h[e]- uh he works over in Maryland	1
agent:yeah those are few and far between though [laughter]|user:but that's uh|user:yeah	yeah	0
agent:too many chiefs and not enough Indians|agent:yeah|agent:[laughter]	yeah so	1
agent:uh-huh|user:yeah like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that|agent:i[llegal]- illegal or something like that yeah	but they won't let you off what they'll do is like	0
agent:yeah well you know that's that's a that's a big thing|agent:um-hum|user:and so that's what you're gonna go for [noise]	and and you know it's like for example like Leading Edge have you ever heard of Leading Edge	1
user:[vocalized-noise] well i mean there's like|user:you know|agent:most people do or they have to anyway	when when you realize [vocalized-noise] tea[chers]- one of my teachers got this computer and which you know it's like um voice uh synthesis and stuff [noise]	0
agent:well when you get yeah when you get right down to it the uh the more they can do for you the more uh like i say the more the more memory they're gonna require|user:imagine imagine what it is for us to make Markov models you know it's like [laughter] Jesus Christ|agent:that's amazing yeah	yeah	0
agent:uh-huh|user:while i was waiting for uh the system to find a a respondent|agent:uh-huh	and i started thinking that over the years that importance has changed and i suspect that that's probably true for everyone	1
agent:yeah|user:one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves|user:a	and that's certainly one of the reasons that i'm sure that they've	0
user:had another career first|user:but i|agent:right	and then came to TI a little later	1
user:uh it's|agent:yeah|user:until later	shown a history	0
user:and then her|agent:yeah exactly exactly|agent:yeah	little brother's only two years behind and he says well i don't know i think that i probably want to be a veterinarian and i said that's great let me explain to you how you get [laughter-scholarships] to do that	0
user:well i could certainly|agent:so that is kind of an idea that that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in and TI said that they were looking into something like that so|agent:you you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them_1 at the time you know you['re]- you're really not being paid for them_1 the money is actually coming out of your own pocket but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once you know	personally stand seeing them go to a	0
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:work overtime there they should give me one day	but it should be a standard and and not left up to	0
agent:oh that's right i think now that i recall reading about it in the paper|user:well yes of course we do have capital punishment and we've you know done away with our quote fair share number|agent:in the state do you	yes	1
agent:yeah it's really sad|user:taxpayer money|agent:that it kee[p]-	yeah	1
user:th[at's]-|agent:repeat and ne[ver]- never have any chance for|user:oh absolutely	that's right	1
user:they're only|user:yes|agent:that still does it that's right	i was reading something about it the o[ther]- day i i wanna [vocalized-noise] think there's only like six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still	0
agent:if it finally gets to that point|user:yes|user:uh-huh	[noise] right the first appeal is automatic so	0
user:it's a it's a tough question it really is i guess if i had to say|agent:hum|user:yes absolutely	you know yes or no i would say you know yes i- i would have to	0
user:yes|agent:and it's kind of been scary to think about it and|user:yes especially the murder rate its just gone crazy	absolutely	1
agent:so maybe you would|user:uh-huh that's right|user:absolutely	yeah	1
agent:well anyway i sure have enjoyed uh [laughter] talking about this although it has been difficult but uh|user:yes absolutely|agent:that would be really awful	it is it's a tough subject it really is	1
agent:um-hum|agent:hum|user:uh my only experience with it i was in Central America for a while and uh in San Salvador in El Salvador for instance	everybody had what they called there social year	0
agent:i didn't know|user:yeah|agent:send children you know to do that	i don't i don't know how the Peace Corps works i guess i was of age when the Peace Corps came [laughter-in] and all that	1
agent:yeah|user:yeah [noise] well i guess that's uh|agent:yeah i've heard that like in China and stuff there is virtually no such thing as rape because if you [laughter-rape] somebody you'd be murdered them you know on the you know street so	the price of freedom i guess is a little	0
agent:yeah that's true|user:people will kind of set up their own little club|user:you know there are	[noise] and uh but if	0
user:um-hum|agent:things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way i i it would take quite a few people i think it might build jobs for people you know that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that so maybe that part of it would be helpful too|user:um-hum	yeah	0
agent:yeah really there could be um|user:and uh when the politics of it get real confusing|agent:um-hum	uh	1

user:the University of Utah and|user:i went off to i grew up in California and i went off to|user:choosing a college i i kind of did or i'd	didn't find the atmosphere there what i quite expected so i came back and went to Cal State	0
agent:in uh college uh in fact very few people finish in four years now|agent:so but i know many people who have changed majors several times|user:[laughter]	do you think it do you think it's well worth going to uh uh bigger school or more well-known school	1
user:right|agent:uh it could be difficult to uh make a career out of it|agent:uh if you choose a school that's not well known or it does not have a very good curriculum in uh in the in those areas	i think that's what i would tell parents [laughter]	1
user:right|user:yeah|agent:but uh it really did conflict too much with uh with my work it's very difficult uh to maintain a full-time job and try to take uh courses uh in off hours	it's true	1
agent:whether you like the mascot or not or whether it's close by|user:yeah|agent:the rest of it's just personal preference	[laughter]	0
agent:being in the band was about the only entertainment i had|user:[laughter]|agent:tried to have fun	uh i really i miss college i had a good time	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah that is true based on where where you come from and all|user:aren't aren't they like put taking the words and and listening to the dialect and	that's funny	1
user:i always try to read the Sunday paper|user:and then i usually end up flipping through CNN and Headline News during the evening|user:so i try to listen to the radio in the morning and and try to catch one of the morning talk shows	just because it usually gives a summary of the	0
user:so i'm i've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get|user:and i like the national news that we see we we watch NBC and i think they do a real good job|user:um	how about you	1
agent:both the people and the inc[idences]- incidences|agent:two programs uh that i knew|agent:well i used to watch Sixty Minutes until they did	uh-huh	1
user:as the you know news articles or whatever they had they had already been familiar with|user:nearly the same way|user:and that they didn't present it	so i started questioning	1
user:uh|agent:well Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold|user:i liked i- i did grow up with David Brinkley	uh-huh	1
agent:i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst|agent:[vocalized-noise]|agent:uh	really	1
agent:i [laughter-believe] in giving anything a chance|user:uh-huh|agent:taken them all for a year	sure	1
user:well we're working on a Newsweek|agent:and it just seems to fit nicely so that i can get it read in about three days|user:right	uh for the last couple of months we got you know an introductory subscription so we decided to try it because	0
user:no|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:well anytime that we stop and think it can't hurt	i- i even i enjoy reading T News	0
agent:no|user:and the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is um Talking Fingers do you have that|user:yeah	you have different	0
user:it really is|user:it|agent:well it does sound very interesting maybe our phone company out here will get around to offering something like that	yeah it really is nice i mean because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk and find out about	1
agent:so that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as i see these things because of their age|agent:are they're very active right now but they're seventy five and and seventy two|agent:but i really like those those options now and and i think about it more often because my husband's parents	uh-huh	1
user:yeah|agent:because i don't think a lot of people really even in the nice ones and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently they really don't necessarily like it because they're not in their own home|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:oh|agent:but it was this little bitty one bedroom house but it was a separate house and they had a living room and a bedroom and a kitchen and a bathroom so they still had they had and they had people who came in who um supervised th[em]- all these houses were like fifteen or twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block and they had a a supervisory um|agent:supplemented their they were most of them were on social security and they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government	uh-huh	1
agent:and i guess that that it was a pilot program i think where she lived so it's probably not widely available|user:yeah|user:um	uh-huh yeah	0
user:well yeah|agent:yes unless they're at a point where they're mentally incapaci[tated]- [noise] say like you're saying with Alzheimer's and [vocalized-noise] going to be [noise] the people who have to be there|user:but i think before i- like you i don't think y[ou]- i don't think it's right to just put someone in it i think they would have to agree to go in it	uh-huh	1
user:um-hum|agent:well [noise] they did have a fairly decent year finally this year at least they're coming around|user:yeah	yeah they're going to get better	1
user:yeah|user:okay|agent:and they haven't been doing too hot so	has Herschel Walker done much for them	1
agent:yeah|user:i'm pretty impressed with him so far did he did he actually play in the Pro Bowl|user:Emmitt Smith yeah he's been doing real good	i remember he was like a backup and then somebody got injured and he was supposed to go	1
user:um|agent:one and six and then they won five or six in a row|agent:well they started out really bad they went like	um-hum	1
user:i'm just saying i shouldn't i shouldn't blast him like that say oh well Laufenberg got out there and blew it for them_1 i mean|user:well|agent:oh don't make any excuses for him [laughter]	he didn't get to see much action but	0
user:um|user:but i heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that uh Aikman's back in practicing doing real real well|user:but it wasn't anybody i'd really heard of	who is it Michael Irvin	0
agent:talk much more about that but i just thought i'd throw that in there [laughter]|agent:anyway i guess we can't|agent:so	what [laughter] oh okay [laughter] maybe i'll call you back after [laughter] after the recording is finished	0
user:[laughter] since they've been to Phoenix they haven't been uh|agent:and yeah oh of course|user:back when they were in Saint Louis	all that impressive i guess	1
agent:again what are they going up to thirty bucks or something|user:i think tickets are yeah|user:but they're raising prices on their tickets so they're banking on doing good next season	thirty or thirty two for really good tickets see they they sectioned it out even more they used to just have like uh first of all it was all one price and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else	0
user:i didn't really think about that i just remember trying to figure out|user:um you know i'm not sure i'm not positive i didn't|agent:so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year	where you could get that was real close to the good section [laughter-but] [laughter-in] [laughter-the] [laughter-little] [laughter-bit] [laughter-cheaper]	0
user:yeah that's what|agent:you sure did to to whom am i speaking|user:did i reach the Dallas area	my name is Fernando	1

user:now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities and they wish to get the same thing they say why can't we have the same things that|agent:um-hum|user:and so as as and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city	these other people have and the thing that we can do is	0
user:and you can tell by the people who are always caught that|user:and uh somebody walks in there with a gun i mean they're going to want the money|agent:yeah	these people are there to get money for drugs i mean they don't want the money so uh so they can do something else with it	1

agent:okay|user:and and uh other than the work place and here at home um i don't know too much is going on in the community i know that in Plano it's a larger city in the area they they uh i believe about a month or two ago they started having the citizens separate their refuse|user:yeah that's a good idea	and they've even um got a particular [noise] huge uh waste can that they have to use	1
agent:but but you'd think that uh garages could do that|user:um machine oil because_1 i always have my oil changed out of the house but|agent:uh-huh	[noise] yes i'm sure they do uh	0

user:when i was in Houston there was one station of|agent:silly|user:uh well uh	just uh	1
agent:well i guess there were i guess it was pretty popular because there was quite a lot of Twin Peak conversation|agent:oh|user:well let me tell you that Twin Peaks was much better when it just started so maybe it's time for it to quit i they've gone downhill too	well the thing i liked about it was that it was	0
agent:sounds like a pretty good show i'm sorr[y]- sorry i m[issed]-|agent:[laughter]|user:i suspect that that's a reference to Thoreau's Fish in the Bucket of Milk but i don't know for sure and i'm not sure what the relevance would be if it were but	anyway	1
agent:um-hum|user:uh we just about had to get it because the reception in our particular locality was so poor|agent:uh and it just it just wasn't worth it just to get those three	that we could only get about three stations and uh	0
agent:yeah yeah|user:there's a big difference there|agent:uh-huh there is a big difference	but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline	1
agent:to not charge except for emergencies|agent:well i've been pretty lucky in that respect i don't charge like i say i've i been trying to|user:[laughter] i try to keep it pretty reasonable	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:we're just more or less at American Express you know and that way we can go ahead and pay it off|agent:yeah	when it comes in	1
user:yeah|agent:so|user:uh-huh	well i've enjoyed talking to you	1
user:i feel if a person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt|user:i- i have some feelings about it in the sense that|agent:yeah	and it's a really heinous crime	0
agent:uh-huh|user:involved some teenagers|user:we in fact we have an example going on right now with this uh school teacher	into uh committing murder get getting rid of her husband	0
user:i think she probably|agent:yeah|user:um you know let's face it that's at a point in your life when you you're just starting to realize all the things of life	had a lot of influence on them and they probably would have never done something like that	0
user:the the other the other hand where you say you know if there's just that slim chance that they didn't do it|user:but if there's|user:on one hand like i say if they're if they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt	and then you know spend the time say life imprisonment	1
agent:that was something wasn't it uh it's unbelievable this|user:yeah really|agent:national [laughter-news] [laughter]	but you know i- i- i saw i can't figure out what people are doing any more	1
user:if someone is guilty of a terrible crime or they're a serial killer or mass murderer|user:and the other point someone made at one one time was that|user:yeah	that if they're in prison that gives you the chance to	0
user:you know even if it took five years i think that if at that time you you feel that they were guilty or that they were|agent:yeah|user:to question the person or to get into their head	uh of sound mind where they knew what crimes they were committing i mean people know what they're doing	1
agent:yeah|user:to build a bigger intake center|agent:um	so i mean it it's like where does this all stop	1
agent:that's true|user:you know|agent:um-hum	on their own	0
user:it's it's all well and good to|user:yeah i- i do myself i really think that|agent:you know civilized enough where we could do away with it but as of right now and the way things are i think it's uh something we just have to have	um be a do-gooder	0
agent:[laughter]|user:i think all our laws are are really screwed up|agent:well i just uh	i do i- i don't know what to do about it i wish i did	1
agent:can't remember that|user:or as children|agent:all right	and whether or not to uh institute you know capital punishment where it was necessary	0
user:it's so hard to get people even institutionalized because they're overcrowded|user:mentally incompetent you know uh like deranged|user:imagine so see this is what i'm saying and even with uh people who are	so you have people walking the streets that are	0
user:[noise] pardon me [noise]|agent:oh okay|user:that i saw advertised on TV and i'm looking forward to getting that and cooking some Chinese food	but uh	1
agent:um okay_1|user:mix all that up together and put it on the steak|user:and uh some uh seasoned salt	tastes pretty good gives it a kind of a hickory flavor	1
agent:well what kind of things do you normally have with it people have different ideas of what goes with it|agent:yeah|user:yeah i can remember the big Thanksgiving dinners my mother would make	yeah uh you mean Thanksgiving	1
agent:and you got to have your pumpkin pie|user:got to have the cranberry sauce yeah|agent:and you got to have your cranberry sauce now i like the jellied kind	so being from the north i guess corn bread and black eye peas are str[ange]- are strange to [laughter-you]	0

agent:i think last let me try to think i think the last time we had a big meal like that we did have both i think we did have both on Thanksgiving [noise] just in case people you know have a variety|user:yeah i much prefer ham than i do turkey on Thanksgiving|agent:you always have to have a ham or something on Easter	well	0
agent:um-hum|user:but of course you you know you eat day in and day out at one p[articular]- particular place|agent:oh	and i guess you get tired of it or whatever and it doesn't seem like it's	1

agent:uh-huh|user:uh basically the food and the price i it's sort it's set up on a sort of a buffet sort of thing you go up and pick your own vegetables and all that fill up your own plate|agent:your Chinese food place there that makes you keep going back	and then you drop it off at the uh grill	0
agent:right|user:if the food is bad you're obviously not going to go back|user:i don't know i to me that's the thing that you got to have	but if the food is good and the price is decent and the service is lousy i have a tough time going back again	1
agent:yeah|user:which is sort of indicative of the whole problem|agent:yeah	uh	1
user:there's a family restaurant|user:but we've got a uh family|agent:yeah	here i don't know if they're over in Texas yet i know they're in Louisiana it's called Ryan's	1
agent:so you can't complain about that really|agent:yeah right|user:and of course you your service is pretty good because it's serve yourself	can't complain too much they they they have people come around and uh	1
agent:oh|user:and this is my first time in one in North Carolina and they were terrible|user:Alabama and Georgia	[noise]	0
agent:that you want to to cook you know filet or T bone or whatever it is|agent:that they have set up for the people to use and you go in and you pick out your own selection of meat|agent:three huge grills	um-hum	1
agent:yeah yeah if you're ever in or around the area do give it a try because it's really good food|user:yeah that sounds pretty neat it'd be worth giving a try|agent:you know pay for it but it's really a it's really a neat phenomena how it all works out	that's pretty interesting i've never heard of anything like that	1
agent:yeah i bet you can't get find Mexican food over there i had always wondered what i'd do if i lived somewhere other than Texas|agent:oh|user:probably burn the place down	well come to think i've never even seen a Mexican here	1
user:yeah|agent:uh as long as i can remember|user:it's been around for a long time hadn't it	who's the coach's name	1
user:really|agent:he's got a TV show down there and everything|user:huh	where are y'all living now	1
user:i used to watch basketball in fact of of the pro sports i guess it's my favorite it's just that|agent:uh|user:[laughter]	i haven't watched many sports this year or in the past several years	1
agent:you know having all short people and uh|user:yes [noise]|agent:yeah well they put up a good show they did pretty good for uh	uh-huh	1
user:him|agent:Denny Crum ran his mouth a little bit too much|agent:so but uh	[laughter] on national TV	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah he was a he's uh we call him Dana Jerk|agent:and uh	oh	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah these were young kids too they couldn't have been out of middle school|user:especially the kids that were buying them_1	huh	1
agent:yes|user:in the school systems that's right|agent:if your kid's not ambitious he can sure get lost	what school system does he go to	1
agent:well you know the the the thing that i don't see and i i maybe you would take issue with it is that if if we went to|user:i'm definitely not are you kidding|agent:uh i i'm firmly convinced that teachers aren't being paid enough would you argue with that	[laughter] no	1
agent:yeah it's it's less degree days you're right but i think i think clearly|user:isn't it less|agent:yeah	and it's not going to be like the kids are going to go a lot longer really if you go year around	0
agent:can't think of his name but the idea that|agent:adminis[trator]- um|agent:the one of the the one they brought in the new uh superintendent for Dallas schools the	Marvin Edwards	1
agent:but just think of all the them all the lawyers you've kept employed see|user:and all the things that Dallas fights costs thousands probably millions of dollars i bet you|agent:Dallas to to to to fight that in court	yeah i know	0
user:[laughter] i don't know no telling|agent:that's interesting and how many administrators is that going to take|agent:hum	i don't know	0
user:[laughter]|agent:well but that's the point as i would say uh and that's that's what makes|user:to do anything with them	yeah	1
user:you know always objectives you know it's like there's not a whole lot of you know fun time like we used to have in school|agent:yeah|user:but see what we're doing is we're turning these kids off to school even more than they are and we're not teaching toward the test we're teaching	like our principal says i want every child to be on task all the time	1
agent:exactly and when i'm sitting here on the sofa cross-stitching and all of a sudden somebody a man's got their hand on my door knob it's like uh like oh no and so i don't i don't like that and i guess the only way to prevent it would be just to pass a city ordinance to|agent:they just|user:uh-huh yeah because they're just sort of coming from the side or whatever	yeah	1
agent:like we have a Visa and we've got we get ten applications probably a month|user:yeah|user:uh-huh	that's i agree yeah and it	1
user:[noise] it takes uh|user:yeah that's right|agent:like that and therefore i feel it's an invasion of privacy because i thought all these people share you know what they're doing even though it's none of the business	uh-huh	1
agent:normally when my husband's here they come when i'm here alone|user:[laughter]|agent:the when the cults come by they come by during the day and it says in the Bible that be weary of the people coming door to door trying to proselytize the silly women lay captive with gossip and stuff and i see that they don't come home when my husband's here they don't come to my house	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:so you pull out your dollar and you fill out this coupon and and then when you look at it as you walking away you see that it's for some sales pitch of some kind where they're going to you know and i find that a big invasion of privacy i just i'm from then on in it's like oh this makes me angry you know now you have to question everybody on what they're doing now you sure this goes to such and such organization|agent:uh-huh	and you sure you're with multiple dys[trophy]- you know muscular dystrophy or whatever i find that a big invasion of privacy too	0
user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:and there's nobod[y]- but there's no husband there to come in and say wait a minute|agent:right	yeah	1
agent:uh-huh|user:so um i get you know we i saw some news out of like New Hampshire and a big thing in the courts right now is um|user:what you know the the terrible thing is i don't know if you've watched the news lately i- i guess we just had something up here you're i'm in Baltimore Maryland	they don't have enough stalls in women's bathrooms as they do men's bathrooms	0
user:it you know the people who do it|user:i'd have to say that uh|user:yeah it's definitely up to the person uh so	well some feel it's rewarding i don't know you know	1
agent:yeah|user:well it sounded like i mean this is like maj[or]- long term commitment like a year or six months or|agent:would they be talking about i mean [vocalized-noise] the the recording mentioned the Peace Corps	so you're looking at the Peace Corps or sabbatical maybe or you know i don't know i mean but uh	1
user:uh|agent:yeah|user:the culture usually i guess i think that maybe that's why some people do it is	to see the other cultures or	0
agent:oh|user:they're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off|user:and	so	0
agent:time|agent:and to decide what they want to do and the Peace Corps or something like that is probably useful as as that kind of a|user:yeah m[aybe]-	yeah maybe a little bit in that perspective but uh	0
agent:but i don't and none of my|user:yeah|agent:i'd probably have a different perspective if i actually knew someone that had gone into the Peace Corps	i- i i don't	1
agent:oh probably five or six|user:how many times have you talked|agent:i know it [laughter]	yeah	1
agent:and i haven't gotten a one of them_1 yet when i've called|agent:i i would enjoy talking about|agent:and stuff that i can	i had uh let's see i've had fishing	1
user:like staying in shape or working out|user:i think i had some other uh|user:so so that one was all right and then what else i had	this other guy i got this guy from New York so	1
agent:lot of uh oh [laughter] some some plant food once a month|agent:yeah yeah as as long as you give it uh good drainage and uh|agent:uh	right yeah we built up our we built up boxes and put them_1 in that so that they would drain because_1 our soil is so bad	1
agent:uh-huh|user:we planted three pecan trees out front and every one of them_1 died i told my husband this is the last one if it dies we're going to something else|user:well that's good we	but we dug a hole about six times as big as it needs to be and filled it with all kinds of compost and	0
agent:yeah i don't do much with flowers myself i just get a lot of ever[green]- evergreen type shrubs some uh some uh dwarf Burford hollies and Yaupon hollies|user:puts a lot of color out there|agent:uh-huh	all year	1
agent:do you do your own uh lawn maintenance or do you hire somebody to uh to do that|user:oh really|agent:they they are very sharp	yeah we do it my husband does most of the mowing and	0
user:huh|agent:it's fine for my size yard but uh it really doesn't have the power of a gas motor|user:really	i would like a self-propelled one i think	1
agent:uh i think it's probably because we lived out in the country somewhat and uh there just wasn't the emphasis on keeping the yards looking real nice|agent:um not nearly as much as here|user:strictly and stuff as they do down here	yeah	1
agent:you'd think that that would be the first thing they would do as far as the yard goes is to plant a tree|agent:right|user:get some shade and keep their houses a little bit cooler in the summer	yeah yeah	1
user:my um husband's father has a place out in East Texas so he's always digging up little|agent:they're very hardy for this area|user:i like an oak oak trees yeah	red oaks and things like that and trying to bring them_1 back and start them_1 but	0
agent:yeah|user:yeah i know the guy at Wolfe told us they cut back on the tree warranty like six months or less|agent:on their uh warranty for the shrubs the past couple of years	but Calloway's has kept theirs forever so	1
agent:they haven't really had any good sales on plants yet|user:uh-huh|agent:i'm just waiting for a sale	yeah i've i've noticed that they haven't had anything great	1
agent:but mine keep dying back down to the ground so i haven't had that problem yet|user:oh really|agent:right they can get out of control	yeah	1
user:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh but those are probably about the only two that i that i usually [laughter] with any regularity|user:yeah i like Cheers	back when i had time to watch TV oh maybe last year when i wasn't doing aerobics and work wasn't quite as busy as it's been lately um	0
user:yeah|agent:yeah i like the lessons it's a good uh good it's got a lot of good morals to it so i enjoy that one|user:yeah it's kind of cute um	yeah	1

user:but um|agent:yeah|user:yeah it's um th[e]- the one down thing about having that many people in our family is you real[ly]- we really don't have any privacy when we're at home because you couldn't possibly have a house with twelve bedrooms	like i say you know i'm twenty i'll be twenty two next month and i'm closer to the younger kids than i am the ones my own age	0
user:yeah|agent:so you you had a lot of games and things you played even when you were kids with the ones that y[ou]-|agent:oh hurtle oh okay	[noise] well see they're um we're all	0

user:but uh i enjoy going and cutting the grass i like the way it looks|agent:yeah|user:i i feel a lot better doing it with a power mower with that with a [laughter] with a pull tractor on it so i don't have to push so hard	and uh	1
agent:system that they're trying to promote here which is uh they don't bag it as they call it|agent:uh|agent:and they have a new	yeah	1

user:i know in the summer time i've got to uh|agent:right|user:oh we i- i don't go that uh that deep it starts getting cold wh[en]- as soon as the cold weather comes it stunts the growth of the uh the grass	i've got to h[old]- actually hold it as long as i can uh as long as i can make the grass	0
user:and i uh|agent:right|user:uh no later than once a week	i don't block off my my uh chute but i don't pick up my grass either	0
agent:i don't think so|agent:[laughter]|user:[laughter] you supposed to put chemicals on it	no [laughter]	1

user:we haven't we were a landmark case it was the first time in the state of Ohio that um|user:uh in view of the fact that uh|user:the judges probably do make the decision rather than the jury Our situation was somewhat different	D N A testing was entered as evidence	0
agent:um-hum|user:and the judge was extremely concerned for our welfare if we were well if we were comfortable and uh things of that nature which made us feel good|agent:jeez	uh and we were sequestered	0
agent:yeah|user:from the standpoint that it was difficult to try to remember everything and and yet the judge said|user:uh and i thought that that was a failing because uh	well um if you're taking notes you're missing something	0
user:yeah i do think that that uh i do think the jury system works but i'd i also feel as you said that the original concept of the jury as it was originally setup|user:yeah|agent:i'm like God this is ridiculous [laughter]	uh back uh in a hundred years ago was fine but that it needs to be more refined for today's standard of living and the the uh level of education of them of so many people now	0
agent:yes i- i think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that uh you know people would get a fair trial|user:and uh you know some of it just seemed rather extreme|user:to be with his wife on the birth of the twins	yes	1
agent:jeez|user:burned him|user:a confession or information from a drug dealer and did so by placing a hot a hot iron on his chest his bare chest	they wound up paying him uh	0

user:and yeah he did some clever things but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was it seems to me they could have done a lot more|agent:right|user:you know it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in	i mean you know ba[sically]- basically stepping on things and yelling in pain	0
user:uh-huh|agent:but uh anyway that was a French movie it was um that was the last one i saw downtown but i i live in DC|user:[laughter]	ha ha	1

agent:[laughter]|user:i um i'm i'm clearly enough you know i'm i'm clearly an intellectual snob to be going to these kinds of movies i realize that|user:but	i mean to go to these movies and expect them to be	0

user:read an article um|agent:yeah|agent:um-hum	really restating some conclusions of some some uh	1
user:but it was an interesting uh|agent:yeah|user:from the eyes and the mental processes on up i don't know what it would have to do with the connectivity to the rest of the body	uh line of reasoning where we've always thought or been told especially by the [vocalized-noise]	0

user:now have you thought about this|agent:oh gosh yeah just just the opposite of what everybody's uh working towards now|agent:yeah	that wherever you buy your paint you need to make sure that that store's not likely to go out of business	1
agent:i guess i- i moved a couple of outlets and or uh switches i should say they um for some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway|agent:the only the most major things have been uh oh|agent:as as far as uh major repairs you know lo[t]- a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that but uh	um that's smart	1

agent:it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good|user:but um|user:i think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or or a regular beater	yeah but i still think a beater would do it good enough	0
user:i'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg|user:and i'll do this uh sometimes i'll put my after I pour that into my back into my saucepan|user:yeah	so	1
user:and shake the water off the Saran Wrap and i might put it back on|user:and then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap so when you pull the Saran Wrap back you sort of should be a little careful pull it back|agent:uh-huh	but um	1

user:uh well i'm kind of a car buff myself i was going to ask you another question but uh|agent:i think how do you feel about about all this smog and m[ess]- stuff on cars|agent:and if there isn't if there isn't and we do some the right things	i- i'll do that in a minute i- i think that the changing you know from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage	0
agent:but did you have another ques[tion]- you said you had another question|user:i don't think that's a problem i thought i'm saying i was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline|user:work on my own cars and uh	uh oh ye[ah]- i- the same thing about the war uh or related to the war on i was watching CNN and i cannot remember what station it was	0
agent:but the but when you see when you get up in the morning in in Dallas and and see all that haze from west Texas is that is that pollution|user:oh really yeah there there's probably a lot of natural things uh|agent:that that's the uh the pine trees giving off pollution and	yeah	1
agent:yes yes|user:well you said you were car buff uh i think that uh all of us could use one electric car right now i mean today|agent:and now the valley is not and so people move out one more valley and	because i think uh	1
agent:there have been research it was a little light that says solar solar powered research|agent:well th[ere]- there's still a lot of research i was over in in the research lab a couple i guess it's been about a month ago and saw this|user:were nine years away or less i guess from the next century and i think	yeah they've got a they've got a area over in the SE building too which is uh	0
agent:they had one with spots on it and something i didn't go but i[t]- wa[s]- it was showing they i mean uh|agent:well i thought i saw an ad for Volkswagen that had an alcohol|user:air pollution or companies or anyone there it was just pure automobiles	there	1
user:you know that's one way you know uh|user:whether|user:and uh	uh f[or]- on air pollution i- i- i don't know if the automobiles are are the biggest contributor or not really they've got catalytic converters everyone seem to have	0
agent:yesterday i started exercising seriously|agent:well [laughter] it's funny this week|agent:uh-huh	oh really	1

user:good and i get|user:i don't feel|agent:uh-huh	you know when you get out of shape and you don't	0
agent:um-hum yeah|user:um good exercise and some of the desired results but you you're doing it for fun|user:then you get some of the	but i really admire people who can go and work out and	1
user:but|agent:i agree|agent:yeah	well i guess it's getting late	0
user:uh|user:well i have noticed a lot|agent:what uh what changes have you seen	more women's roles at work which i like in management	0
agent:we only have to get up for you know for the daytime feedings|user:yeah|user:[laughter]	i think	1
agent:i- i- i found it interesting especially uh being from a military background the current fuss over whether women should go into combat or not|agent:but uh|agent:you know or something	yeah	1
agent:well they couldn't be worse than some of the men|user:you know if that's what interests them and they think you know they can handle it i think they ought to be able to do it|user:i think if they want to do it	that's right	0
agent:or a Black woman named Rodriguez|user:she got that scholarship|agent:you know	right they need to give the scholarship to a woman that's true that's true with any case i hate that but	0
user:i mean i understand that they're talking about the job [laughter] not the person in the job that's that's always|user:that's never|agent:right a wait person	that's always been strange i thought but some women like to fight it	0
agent:i think i'd be scared of anybody male or female in that position although you see more and more uh more and more of the ladies that are becoming active in politics|user:right right|agent:but because more for her po[litical]- [vocalized-noise] her political beliefs and what she says she's going to do	right	1
user:uh good and everything but|user:[laughter-yeah] she i mean she seems on the outside|agent:i think her background totally bothers me	but i don't know it just it just kind of bothers me and that that just may be because we're not used to having	0
agent:oh yeah Houston got a female mayor|user:uh first woman mayor so|user:Annette Strauss and she's a	do they	1
agent:you know i would i- i- i would dearly love to find out that you know i could i could say well i guess i was wrong about Ann Richards|user:right|agent:and there's quite a few if they can do the job i think more power to them_1	yeah yeah they always they they say a lot of times that	0
agent:this is you know|user:right right i am surprised though that we do have so many|agent:in the more liberal east and west coast	that are in politics down here	1
user:like like you said it's with man or a woman it sh[ould]-|user:whatever these leaders of ours do that everything's for the good that just|agent:yeah	however they're going to be able to uh take care of us	1
user:i guess we're we're kind of the good old boy type atmosphere of|user:i don't know that's really that's really well it's it's so uh|agent:ascended to that level yet	men always did the	0
agent:yeah|user:can't remember the name of it and she's a multimillionaire from it and i- i just think God|user:yeah there's a lady here in uh Dallas who started a mozzarell[a]- or a cheese company	if only it could be me [laughter]	1
agent:uh-huh|user:uh [noise] i do i do uh word processing on it primarily|agent:i'm i'm curious what you use your uh your home computer for	uh the main reason why i'm i'm hanging on to it is because of the business that i'm in	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and uh we also have a tie in to a mainframe out in in Dallas Texas|agent:right	and the mainframe has a lot of uh software out there where i use to	0
agent:uh-huh|user:quality satisfaction or customer satisfaction|user:and the other big thing is uh	how do how do the users feel about the the system and what are their likes and dislikes	0
user:where i can send telegrams to any TI site|agent:uh-huh|user:which is a worldwide network within within the corporation	and they've also hooked up to some company	0
user:and redo it and then give it back to her again than it does for me to sit down and and do it and correct it myself i i|user:it takes me longer to write it|user:uh and and that i guess part of that is true [laughter] uh i do all my own typing i i i don't give anymore uh paper to the secretary to type up only because	i am not a typist i type with two fingers but i do very well at it	0
agent:right|user:uh like a print shop or or a thing in the system well we have uh instead of using view view foil machines we have uh|user:where they have uh	a transmitter that will pick up the signal from the the monitor	0
agent:[noise]|user:they're uh really not being utilized as much as they had been in the past i'm making some really pretty foils that uh four or five years ago i wouldn't have ever dreamed i could be doing them and|agent:[noise]	it's it's so easy to do uh	0
user:i think one of the facets of living in a small town is that often times|user:um|agent:okay trial by jury	you are uh sitting in on a jury trial where you might be acquainted with at least maybe not that person but part of their family	1
user:and they proved that she had set fire to her car in order to collect the insurance money|user:because even though they knew|user:and more or less instructed us to find her not guilty	that would we find her guilty she would simply flee the state and avoid any prosecution of any kind whatsoever	1
user:he was convinced that the person was not guilty and at the end of their deliberations he finally voted uh|user:that left him uh i mean in the very beginning|agent:uh-huh	guilty uh	1
user:that after all they're|agent:uh-huh|user:guilty of so much {misjustice} from the bench	only people too in that	1
user:when we bought it turned out uh|user:some of the things that we didn't uh think about|agent:[laughter]	worked out all right for us was we bought on a top of a hill	0
user:uh it's kind of a a bad thing to happen but we happen to have landed again in a very lucky spot there is a little business development behind us that's a bit of a a a little bank and a couple of dry cleaning things and|agent:[laughter]|user:it it closed down now that grocery store isn't there and hasn't been there for about six years now so	little strip shopping center but it's several houses down because the property that's the other side of our little wall	0
user:we were new to the this whole process and all we knew is that it was a|user:i mean that wasn't our consideration wh[en]- when we bought it it was a complete blank lot they hadn't even built the house yet and|user:and we really didn't didn't uh	the cheapest house that this this tract development uh sold	1
user:there's there's like|agent:oh that's really nice|agent:uh-huh	twelve or fifteen feet on one side but on the other side there's over sixty feet before the next house because_1 they they set us back a little ways and they turned it sideways	0
agent:[laughter] really|user:and had i only known [laughter-you] [laughter-know] maybe i'd have looked over there|agent:uh-huh	uh what about your house	1
user:i don't know that we've done anything different to prevent ours from doing that but most of our neighbors have ended up replacing them_1 uh buying some nice Anderson windows or some|agent:um-hum|user:[noise] we've got one that's done that uh we've been pretty fortunate most of our neighbors have had many more um	some uh name brand windows	0
agent:oh yeah|agent:damaged|user:that'd be hard to hard to cover all the ones that go bad	it's true	1
agent:okay well it was good talking to you [laughter] bye|user:go see what he wants [noise] okay bye|agent:[laughter]	[noise]	1
agent:um|user:um-hum um-hum um-hum|agent:maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there	how do you feel about it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college how does that uh	0
agent:debts i mean you could have uh|agent:or that i went to high school with that went to civilian colleges and they they've got twenty thirty thousand dollar|agent:oh yeah i mean i know people that graduated	yeah i think if there's any major piece of advice i'd give is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt	0
agent:i- i just couldn't ima[gine]- i mean it's more money than i make in a year so [laughter] you know it you know me being one person with a|agent:i get|user:yeah	[laughter]	1
user:it's really the period when people become adults|user:but what you don't forget is the growing up|agent:yes	i mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways but really	0
agent:that i know a again from high school that i still keep in touch with that didn't go to college and|agent:you know i- i agree with that because_1 i see people|user:um-hum um-hum um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:well i i've seen more graduates from MIT and that being|agent:yeah|user:i mean i see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having such psychological problems that you think this isn't sinking in	[noise]	1
user:uh-huh|agent:instruct professors from other|agent:all the faculty uh for the most part is is military with a few exchange	um-hum um-hum	1
user:so|agent:so what movies have you seen lately|user:[noise]	i really haven't seen any movies lately i the only two movies i've seen were uh	1
agent:what's that|user:Chima Para Diso|user:uh	it's a foreign film	1
agent:yeah it had a really uh i thought the story was really nice and i thought uh the guy that played the projectionist i just thought was superb you know he was great|agent:uh-huh yep that's true|user:i thought yeah i thought that most Americans might not like it because you know of it's it's not that good of a quality film but i mean it's the meaning behind it that i liked	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah see because_1 i i'm not really one that likes real sus[pense]- i like the nice lighthearted comedies most of the time|user:yeah i do|agent:yeah but are you good at do you like suspenseful movies like that	well it depends on what mood you're in too you know	1
agent:friends of hers had rented it and she'd seen part of it but we thought we'd rent the whole thing and actually it's a pretty good movie but it's not great you know|agent:uh a little bit so it ha[ve]- you know and i think she had seen part of it before|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah that that's sort of the way i feel too|user:i don't i don't like to look too deep into movies if it's good it's good if it's not it's not [laughter]|agent:yeah but i didn't think it was that good	yeah	1
agent:the actor that plays Jim Morrison's one of the other uh|agent:and uh|user:uh-huh	Val Kilmer	1
agent:yeah|user:well i think i'll go see that this weekend or next weekend one or the other|agent:so that's uh because he has a pretty strong will and he directs his own way so it should be you know pretty good	because i really want to see it i wanted to see it uh about two weeks ago when i had a chance to go see it but i i went home for the weekend and they didn't have it playing home	1
user:well the the good thing about campus is that we have this uh system that uh|agent:yeah but that's pretty that's good um what do you get many movies on campus|user:yeah	uh it's a it's called UAB uh university something or other i don't know and they give out like movies they show movies in the theatre	0
agent:and i thought that was that movie really told a good story|user:yeah|agent:as as you do a good telling a good story	yeah	1
user:[laughter]|agent:yeah i had used to have a garden until the kids got older and we don't have any more room in the backyard so now all i've got is flowers instead of [laughter-vegetables]|agent:so	yeah we talk about um	0
user:putting it in pots and putting the pots just on our steps|user:so we thought about you know having|agent:um-hum	and growing maybe tomatoes or flowers like right now it would be beautiful in in Maryland you know daffodils are just all blooming	0
agent:it snowed here as late as May before but that was really unusual our our our last freeze is usually about April fifteenth|agent:we hit our we'll hit our last spring freeze|user:oh	um-hum	1
agent:when it's cooler in the spring then it gets too hot in the summer|agent:because otherwise it's too it gets if you start them|user:hum	right	0

user:[laughter]|agent:lead on|user:okay	um drug testing doesn't bother me	1
user:well that's true i- i agree that there should be something done|agent:i think alcohol's a a whole lot worse drug and it's more widely accepted|user:uh	about people	0
agent:and the same is true of the drug hangover you know if you|user:and you're right and you cannot perform well|user:but you you know really and truly th[ere's]- there's nothing worse than a hangover	that's true	1
user:that's true|agent:i don't know|user:yeah	that's true	1
agent:that's what you would think but i kind of i that's|user:let him off of that|user:now i would have thought if he'd have brought in the pres[cription]- wife prescription and explained the situation that they might have	they didn't	1
user:so it seems like they should be able to bend [noise] the rules oops excuse me a little bit|user:because he took his wife's medicine that just doesn't sound right does it|user:i mean because_1 i- i just can't see that they would do some make somebody go to a rehab or whatever they go through	on that	0
user:drugs legal or marijuana legal then we the we wouldn't be going through this|user:so i guess if they made|user:and drugs are illegal	you know they wouldn't be testing	1
agent:if you don't drink you know you used to drink okay you go out and you want to party and that's|agent:spend my money and you know i|agent:because you know it's what i can get away with and if i'm going to go on the weekends	[noise]	1

agent:that's right you you know that could be worth ten thousand dollars so|user:i says gee i ought to get that|agent:yeah	um you never know	0
agent:oh that's nice|user:course now where i where i'm at now i don't have to worry about the lawn because_1 they got somebody that comes in and does it|agent:[laughter]	it is nice he matter of fact he was here today it was the first really warm weather we've had	1
agent:oh do you have a lot of that kind of weather there in North Carolina|user:it's just great up there|agent:uh-huh	no this is another one of those winters that wasn't	1
agent:limits the job your welcome Brittany|agent:yeah that's that's it we'd like to be closer to family but|agent:[laughter]	yeah	0
user:yeah i had a i had an interesting call about uh two weeks ago|agent:yeah he works for them right now he's been there almost six years now|user:i guess that's i guess that's the same with your husband	um	0
user:yeah|agent:yeah they couldn't even be in the house because they had no power and everything|agent:yeah	yeah that's pretty bad	1
user:uh|user:yeah that's too bad because i i i had a an old an ex-professor who|user:yeah	is up there in Rochester	0
agent:uh-huh or hail [laughter]|user:you get a get a frost or|user:uh-huh	something hail	0
agent:uh-huh|user:i i buy them every once in a while and and i bought one and it was you know blah|user:yeah	and then i said well i'll try another one so this is several weeks later and i bought another one and it was just as sweet and	0
user:and uh i think one of my concerns|user:served on a jury one time|user:uh i haven't had too much experience with uh judges and jurors i've uh	after that experience was	0
agent:and the life sentence uh she received|user:um-hum|agent:uh the schoolteacher	yeah i think that was a logical decision there	1
agent:uh the ability of jurors to to ask questions|agent:uh correctly and then one of things i've always wondered is|agent:and ask the questions and	i've never uh really been sure that a juror is entitled to ask a question	1
agent:um-hum|user:did not make the points|user:the County Attorney	but the uh	0
agent:[laughter]|user:okay|agent:and i was trying to place where i had heard it that's very interesting but now back to the topic	[laughter]	1
EMPTY	well i really enjoy reading the newspaper we get the daily and Dallas Morning News	0
user:well we i don't take like Time or Newsweek or anything like that but i do like to watch um CNN i have several chores and things to do so it comes on at|agent:and then we switched the Morning News but we found we couldn't read enough of it and by the time i got home and had time to to read some but but i guess the the issue is uh beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines|agent:[laughter-went] [laughter-outside] [laughter-picked] it up and ran off anyway um	like the [noise] nine o'clock PM and so i will turn that on while i'm doing some work and i can hear the news not have to sit right down and listen to it	1
agent:yes|user:well i wouldn't think th[at]- i would really say that that's not true because um it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates|agent:and	and so um news stations always tell the story from a certain angle and that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions you may never get the truth but you'll have a variety to choose from	1
agent:yeah|user:you know if it's something really interesting and and then i'll know to|user:oh i just heard on the news that such and such happened	to keep an eye out for it but	0
user:well i really think so i noticed on channel eight that there's|agent:can you tell much difference between the local radio TV stations|agent:anyway the i- i don't know do you do you do you seem to	all of the um anchors are seem to be like White Anglo Saxon [laughter-Protestant] type people and they all seem to be you know fairly similar and i kind of prefer	0
agent:but i think that i think that that from a a justice standpoint because we have the option of not watching that station|user:um-hum|agent:yeah and i think he has legitimate argument i mean you can uh i- i- i grew up in Alabama and so i- i have some prejudices	um-hum	1
agent:[laughter-okay] well good talking to you good night|user:yes i guess it is time to close now so i can run go help put the kids to bed but i have|agent:i wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes have you talked have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes	yes it's nice bye-bye	0
agent:are you originally from uh Texas|user:uh-huh|agent:a couple of days ago but nothing really happened	no i'm from Wisconsin originally	0
agent:yeah [noise]|user:yeah it gets it gets uh hot but uh it's not very humid|agent:yeah the only thing i don't like about uh Dallas weather is that it gets a little bit too hot sometimes in the summer	and there's always a nice uh breeze blowing	1
user:[laughter]|agent:ye[ah]- i'm sure it will in Dallas [laughter-Texas]|agent:yeah	well that's pretty typical though	0
agent:uh-huh|user:they uh they had a high of i think eighteen degrees during the week that i was there|agent:goodness	so it's stayed cold for the entire week	1
user:what's really bad here in winter is when we get uh ice on the roads|user:uh-huh yeah well that's not uncommon|user:we	and the temperature doesn't get above freezing	0
agent:um-hum|agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh	so they usually get uh worse weather [vocalized-noise] than we do	1

agent:get quilts yeah|user:[laughter-oh] yeah|agent:but i know it was cold i had to turn on the heat an[d]-	guess i'll have to turn on the weather	0
agent:my wife left me my dog left me you know [laughter]|agent:i mean they're not th[e]- the typical country where they're just you know|agent:you know	[laughter] my truck is broken [laughter-down]	1

agent:of of like corruption that caused S and L all though i have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sour|agent:i don't have a real since|agent:was was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it and that that appeared to be corruption within the Hoover administration	um-hum	0
agent:you know that it was that easy for them to find new work that they didn't weren't stuck to where they were and as the things begin to collapse they just moved on|agent:and i don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move|user:um-hum [noise]	[noise] i'm not sure	1
user:and i think if they would be more bound|agent:okay|user:and i think the S and L's were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make	to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve	0
agent:to be caught in the land slide|user:and it's and it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this|agent:uh-huh	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|agent:and so you think that it's just gone|user:i think i think we've lost a lot of money and you know like we every never going to get it back it's impossible to get it back	um-hum yeah because_1 we['re]- we're you know we're talking about some companies that have just	0
user:um|user:you know in case something would happen|user:um it it's just it's just for you know safe purposes	yeah [vocalized-noise] as long as there's enough little companies	0
agent:was not a heavy user of any S and L's and and let alone any of them that went bankrupt|user:um-hum|agent:i guess i don't have a personal sense of vulnerability on it since i	[laughter]	1

agent:yeah that that'll be good|user:start some type of uh regular program|user:so maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this spring i can uh	i've always found that that when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep uh keep something going	1
agent:[noise] well i'm trying build up my tolerance now i jus[t]- surgery um less than two months ago and right now i'm just a little over about a mile and a half but i tr[y]- try to workup to three miles|user:how far about how far do you go walking|user:okay	okay	1

agent:do they are the[y]- yeah ok[ay]- they're so they're still he's still doing it then huh oh i'll have to tune in [laughter]|user:yeah well they they do low impact stuff now they're on everyday|agent:then that was back when um you know the high impact and	yeah every morning	1
user:they're on weekdays at eleven o'clock everyday|agent:i haven't watched any other ones on TV um just on some of the tapes so|user:[noise] well i found that they they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on TV	Monday through Friday	1
user:um|user:um|user:i think a lot of it is uh apathy	for example uh when things are going good i think the voter turnout is less just because people	1
user:the way that it didn't go|user:and there were a lot of of minorities that wanted it to go|user:um	but they also had very low voter turnouts especially_1 like in the Hispanic community	0
user:being a citizen not not serving on jury duty is important enough to them_1 that they don't want to have any say|user:not|user:as to how many people vote apparently	in uh	0
user:i mean i didn't know anything about any of these races i didn't know|user:and|user:and i went down this long list of judges that i was voting for	what the responsibilities of the judges were i didn't know anything about the individuals who's names were on the ballet	0
agent:deal with some of the issues lets say that T[exas]- uh Texas State uh Railroad Commission has to solve when you don't even fathom what the implications are of they're decision so who would you care who got in that position you know|agent:uh and it's pretty difficult to|user:yeah	i'd i'd say	0
agent:that's probably well worth it then it probably be worth it just to do away with the cost of the elections and uh put it in the hands of maybe one man who can|user:but it also means you've got a unified state government you don't have different departments pulling against each other|agent:carry a lot more weight	[laughter]	1
user:what i waited maybe ten minutes in line|user:uh the the line|agent:do you find it convenient to vote the actual time of day type where you have to go and the line you have to stand in	it w[as]- it was uh a minor inconvenience it was certainly	1
agent:and i've got to remember uh you know on this election i'm in this district in this election i'm for here and uh you know this precinct votes here|user:yeah|user:yeah	um-hum	1
user:as far as you know what|agent:um-hum|user:being called upon to decide there's very little information on	what is the duties of this political office and uh	0
user:and it explained a lot to me about the individual candidates and helped me make a lot of|user:that covered the major races|user:yeah well they the Dallas Morning News did publish a a section	better informed decisions	0
agent:right|user:that uh you know why vote when it's decided already|user:districts you know there's a a party one party or another that has such a lock on it	that sort of attitude	1
user:well|agent:so i how do you feel that it should be applied|user:applied at all	i ju[st]- i just feel like	1
agent:and they finally get up to where they kill somebody else and they go through fourteen appeals and|user:yeah|user:yeah	uh-huh	1
agent:you know they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's you know that it's going to you know that should be life but instead in in given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life they'll give them ninety years in prison or something|agent:what it means when they sentence them to|agent:cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible	uh-huh	1
user:i- i know yeah|user:but it's|agent:but i don't know what else to do with some of these people that are because_1 they let them back out again and they do the same thing over and over again then they put them back in jail and they get out and	same thing yes	1
agent:well the jury that originally sentenced him sentenced him to death|agent:yeah|user:but yes but still it came up though didn't it i mean you know	uh-huh	1
user:i live in a small place you know|agent:we could go around and boy|user:uh-huh well like i said	but uh	0
agent:yeah uh|user:no i really don't remember anything about it i guess i was about ten when it ended right|user:n[ot]- not much i'm twenty eight so	i was born in sixty two so when did it end	1
user:[noise]|agent:well well the difficulty i have is that uh are we our neighbor's keepers|agent:yes	um-hum	1
user:you know how can you know the Bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you and it's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind so it's like how can you|user:and i know other Christians would disagree with me my husband and i are kind of not even in agreement on this but we don't fight over it or anything but|user:still have a problem with uh you know i haven't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this but	i don't know for me i don't know you know i can't say that i agree with Vietnam because	0
user:and that now he build roads so|agent:but|user:he unified the Chinese language it was impossible for missionaries to do accomplish anything in China because of all that and so even in North and South Vietnam i bet you'd see the same thing	then he'd open and then he dropped dead twenty five years premature he just dropped dead	0
agent:uh the Communists or the uh alleged Democrats uh democratic form of government and i|user:yeah|agent:and the question is who was he going to pay it to	uh-huh	1
agent:that they that they uh they didn't destroy everybody and that that's|agent:well the difficulty is is if you look in the Old Testament and and the numbers of places that uh the Lord went out and just simply struck down and that was part of the problem when they went into the Promised Land|user:because i think its just now coming up to where i really feel like i need to come you know need to decide what i feel	right	1
user:it'd look absolutely ridiculously stupid but it would work out because if you follow the scriptural principals it's going to work out because_1 those are that's|agent:yeah|agent:what do you	the best way to do it you know but the thing is is that then God gets the glory not a president not a king and i think that's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory	1
user:i- [vocalized-noise] i don't have a problem with uh|user:means that i am not for one world government i'm not for all these new age things|user:but i just i have a problem with all the killing but i'm not a new ager i don't believe	national identity and i'm an American and having different nations and all of this	0
agent:um|user:especially in the minority n[eighborhoods]- neighborhoods|user:more rich schools are those are those schools that are financially well off are going to have to support those that aren't	and uh there's a lot of problems with that	1
agent:oh yeah they there they pay them a little better here i think than most than than than than the national average especially these mentor teachers|user:uh not no not too well|agent:they they pay them well	yeah	1
agent:you know i mean so looking at it s[o]- all so i have some bias in this|agent:and um it's always occurred to me that that um|user:yeah	yeah	1
user:uh|agent:um-hum|user:i i'm speaking mostly of elementary	you know it's	0
agent:you know i mean i- i- i can't imagine teaching in a situation like that and actually trying to get anything across to a student|agent:nobody else get's out so it's hard to imagine a|user:yeah	yeah	1
agent:uh i'm i'm i'm actually Jewish so i suspect that i would be more in favor of sort of nonsectarian sort of prayer|agent:possibly i think that um|user:yeah	yeah	1
user:but uh|user:right|agent:[noise] i think so [vocalized-noise] you i- i- i read a little bit on that that that sounds interesting	we've like i say we've been redistricting here in Dallas has been a	0
user:and uh|user:they divide it one way and the minorities say we're losing representation [vocalized-noise] representation|user:what the district should be because_1	it it's just a big battle	1
agent:my only hope is that uh is that whatever i'm going to wined of being college faculty somewhere i think|user:uh in the next you know fifteen years or so later they go it's going up|agent:oh i can't even i can't imagine it [laughter]	yeah	1
agent:well they give some some financial aid for education they they advertise that they give it you can earn up to ten or twenty thousand dollars for|user:after service|user:education uh	yeah	1

agent:yeah i thi[nk]- yeah|user:well there's some people who aren't paying their fair share|user:they don't like to pay taxes because they feel like	and um that makes you feel bad	1
user:are living pretty pretty good life styles but they're not paying income tax|user:that he said that year he claimed [noise] he had didn't have to pay income tax and he thought well you know there's some people|user:didn't have to pay any income tax	and that's not fair	1
user:and um i'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services i enjoy|user:visited|user:our country compared to the other countries i've studied and	how do you feel	1
agent:you know offset the income that they get or whatever|agent:or to buy something that loses money so that they can|user:right	yes	1
agent:yeah|user:have to pay taxes on it|user:and so i think we're you know our salaries are a little bit higher because we	and so i think you know in that way we're compensated	0
user:they|user:you know realize that|agent:well yeah that's [laughter-true]	they couldn't make this kind of money they couldn't live that kind of life style anywhere else	0
user:not having the state income tax and i hope that|user:i like Texas um|user:um um	because um you know that we've had enough industry here that i guess it	0
user:the city had it's|user:um there's enough i know we moved here from Houston and um|user:in the state that	enough money it was really nice that they had uh	1
user:the property tax that we pay and everything is so much higher than|user:yeah it's true and i'm you know like the|agent:really think they should pay for them_1 or something maybe i don't know	my parents pay in Missouri	0

user:well what about uh uh sending all this money overseas supporting other governments third world governments|agent:you know yeah the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles and i don't think Americans are willing to do it|agent:i guess i feel like i know what their long-term vision is i'm kind of like	how do you feel about that	1
user:uh that's|agent:um-hum|user:well i don't believe in a single government or a single control for the world	asking for trouble people are too different	1

user:uh|user:oh i see|agent:oh you don't what they're what they're working on is uh the way i understand it is the computer system that you know in the future and who knows how far in the future they they believe that computers will be able to understand human voice where instead of having to have a keyboard and press in what you want the computer to do you'll be able to tell it what you want it to do and that's why they're gathering the voices in order to do research to enable computers to be able to do that	in other words they want to know if our voice can direct a machine	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:oh wow how wonderful|user:well as a matter of fact my daughter is now the assistant director of nurses at that nursing home sh[e]- yes yes she wasn't at the time	but she has since gone to that nursing home so i just feel that i did not have any of the trauma that people talk about	1

agent:and we just got extremely lucky to find someone who was willing to do it and she stayed five days a week and spent the night but did go home on weekends and then we found another girl who had been kind of coming in and helping Dad clean and do that kind of thing for several years who said that she was willing to stay on the weekends and help him so we just got ex[tremely]- we were like you only the other end we got extremely lucky all the way around that we were able to find somebody [noise] that would stay with him at home|user:yeah|user:um	um-hum	1

agent:in the in the course of a decade um we are [vocalized-noise] a lot has changed more radically|agent:there is and i don't know it's amazing that in the last ten years we've gone from a uh a major loaning nation to a major debt nation|agent:uh in addition to whatever philosophical investment	yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:i don't know there's if there's a metaphor going on who are we loaning the money to and people can disagree about who that money is being loaned to|agent:so it's a sort of like this is uh [vocalized-noise] i see a [vocalized-noise]	yeah in some in some cases it	0
agent:[laughter]|user:i don't really have a good solution for the budget thing either except for that um|agent:um	i know that they're trying to be they're that they're supposedly trying to be fair with taxes	1

agent:oh okay|user:well it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build|agent:no not really i'm not that up on that sort of thing	uh	0
user:greater assets than you already have|user:i think that's when you you start deciding that you really need|user:how they can help you do different things	when you start seeing what all they can do for you	1
agent:sure|user:kind of lost in the in the translation|user:but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement uh you know once you get passed thirty three megahertz all help is	because you no longer can think that fast anyway	1
agent:oh uh-huh|user:then when we started having children we bought a camper|user:and we did it that way	you know and we did it that way	1
user:but now i enjoy it every once in a while i mean it's not something i'd want to do|user:oh|user:yes yes	real often	0

agent:yeah [laughter] that's true|user:because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles you know [laughter]|agent:now that's true that's true	that makes a difference	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:oh|user:yeah we have burlap sacks and they give us one for uh aluminum and uh steel one for metals and one for glass and then	you can either bundle your newspapers or put them_1 in grocery bags	0
agent:using garbage for uh energy|agent:you know there i've seen talk about uh|agent:find some sort of uh use for them_1 if you know	um-hum	1

agent:well the but uh something nee[d]- does need to be done about the styrofoam that uh|user:but i that's not going to be a regular feature that was just a one time thing right after Christmas|agent:right well see that's one	well those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills	1
agent:[laughter]|user:China cups to use up our water|user:uh	[laughter]	1
agent:number one|user:health care|agent:health care	like dental	1
agent:oh i|user:health health insurance is one of the major ones i don't know about dental i mean|user:but i- i do agree with you that	dental is is kind of like uh you know you're asking for uh too much	0
user:as health|agent:but uh dental insurance is important to me it is not as important as uh as health insurance you know if i had to rank them|user:um-hum	right	0
agent:i see well it will become even more important you know when and if you do|user:no not yet|agent:absolutely do you have a family	um-hum	1
agent:same to you [vocalized-noise]|user:well it's been nice talking to you|agent:oh absolutely absolutely	i guess i'll uh	0
user:and you kn[ow]- uh people go home and the jury duty is always like you know kind of whining about it [laughter-all]|user:you know i mean some sometimes i feel like maybe some of them are just kind of pressured or not really into you know and|user:yeah that that is uh a tough situation i mean because	seems like if people were were really you know	0
agent:okay if it the only thing that i was thinking about as far as having if you had one holdout out of say twelve|user:yeah i kind of agree with that|user:uh	yeah	1
user:what do they call it um|user:a case to court and it's|user:is is there true that there's a if a lawyer takes a	frivolous is that is there still a frivolous law that they can	1
agent:doing what they call more of a family court where he gets to go listen to all the divorces so it wasn't much of a step up as it were|user:oh really|agent:and he is uh just recently changed from hearing all the the DWI type stuff to uh	oh really [laughter]	0
user:seems like|user:yeah i mean because|agent:as far as the judge making the decision	i don't know i mean there's so many different	0
user:yeah|agent:several social issues and have opinions on things like that he just doesn't want to take his time to go to the jury duty so he probably doesn't vote either so he doesn't get called in some|agent:current on all you know	yeah true	1
agent:technical and those who you know friends i have are usually we discuss technical items and we don't uh try to follow the world's problems|agent:but uh my realm is pretty well|user:yeah	yeah	1
user:right|agent:you know not what they used to be uh [laughter] [vocalized-noise]|agent:you know if if they have completely chan[ged]- [vocalized-noise] the place has completely turned that much around to where they're not	it's it's hard to to know anymore if it's uh a threat one way or another because	0
agent:you know we're getting uh sucked into something here you know if if somebody's about to|agent:dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute|agent:uh	um-hum	1
user:you know even if they're saying that beneath the doors|agent:um-hum|user:uh the US isn't the threat that we've always made them out to be	but it's hard to think that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period	0
agent:i don't know|user:so it's easier for us to say you know to an Iraq you know|user:of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do on it have [vocalized-noise] have not been world powers	uh you can't do this get back you know or we're going to force you	1
agent:took off toward you know just s[ome]- some pretty hard by the socialism|agent:well this would be like if somebody was elected president of the United States and suddenly|agent:yeah	um-hum	1
agent:yeah there there was uh the whole thing was put together|user:uh a volunteer or willingness to join|user:uh and that they may have been forced i'm not that familiar with their future but i you know i it's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than	but	1
user:the reason they have the Angolan Heights and the|agent:yeah|user:[vocalized-noise] that buffer isn't going to help you you can li[ke]- i guess like with uh Israel is a perfect example	the uh all their buffer area is between Jordan and uh the Sinai an[d]- and Lebanon was just as a buffer but you know as you can see with the the scuds go right over there	1
agent:you know republics as a separate country you know so there'd be there'd be nineteen rather than one|agent:of these|agent:one of the first things the Russians wanted to do was bring in each one of the uh	oh as a	0
agent:and Czechoslovakia and now all of a sudden they're going home and somebody's got to pay for their|user:exactly an[d]- and all the|agent:troops that have been taken care of by uh Bulgaria and	well that's what they're saying the whole problem you know with if we were to demilitarize Europe [noise] what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there	1

agent:it just more yeah i know what you mean|agent:well that's great|user:and whatever we very rarely will eat at a uh a fast-food restaurant i will i'll eat at one more often because of graduate school and being on the road more	but um yeah but she w[ill]- she almost refuses you know to do that in fact we're at a point now where if we do a salad bar at the grocery store	0
agent:oh jeez|agent:yeah|user:barely surviving here and and we get calls now from like World Wildlife Federation	like demanding a hundred dollars	0
agent:is like gourmet [laughter] [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] [laughter-i] [laughter-just] you know what i mean it's just fun it's convenient um|user:um-hum|agent:um i mean to me either ordering in or just going to Pizza Hut or something	yeah i i agree	0
user:or um|agent:uh-huh|agent:so i	uh for we just recently got married so my wife	0
agent:that's not good Lakers got so many different players|user:yeah|agent:and see i don't think they should build up on one person like Chicago with you know with Michael Air Jordan and	they do they always seem to get the talent there	1
user:we[ll]-|agent:figure out what they need to do and catch on to each other|agent:eventually they're going to have to	he doesn't have that Hollywood attitude	1

user:Boston|agent:what team does he play for Celtics|agent:God Larry Bird	Celtics right	1
agent:Atlanta|agent:yep if they get by Detroit i think they can get by b[y]- uh|user:they have to get by Detroit and Chicago [laughter] i think either one of them is a real tough challenge for them	but yeah i don't think Atlanta would be much as much a problem as Chicago	1
agent:yeah|agent:that are trying|user:yeah i think day care seems to be uh	a real big issue	1
agent:because_1 i- i just don't have that discipline with children that uh you need for them to learn|user:no|agent:whoops you know it's not for me	right	1
agent:[vocalized-noise] using it as a baby a babysitter|user:my parents probably did that to me a little bit [laughter]|user:i don't know i think	um	1

agent:yeah|user:no i'm single right now and i'm you know sorting things out which way i'm going to go with my life before i|agent:really are you married	have kids you know	0
user:th[e]- the biggest difference i got to agree was the idea that we were allowed to go and get it done rather than than set up a a line and say we're not going to let you cross this this point anymore and|user:the uh|agent:except jack around with it	that really hurt the uh the peop[le]- uh the Vietnam experience uh	0
user:isn't it logical that just any of th[e]- that you can|user:mean uh back in the fifties and forties the blacks didn't like the whites the whites didn't like the blacks but we're getting to the point where we get along pretty good i mean|user:but is i mean is that any different than uh the way it is in even our country i	solve differences like that	1
agent:not only the Mideast but also in in the what they call the emergency African nations the third world|user:um-hum|agent:but i think you know probably the probably the Middle East is if you have too many tribes mixed up with troubled mentality	right right	1
agent:they can't even agree on which facet of of uh Muslim they want to follow|agent:oh i'd i- i will but seriously doubt th[at]- that you will have peace in the Mideast as long as you have so many war infections that are|agent:he's a prime example	[laughter]	0
agent:and uh support them|agent:you know Muslims as [vocalized-noise]|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
user:let's say i'd have to say overall that the the war was was beneficial to the United States with|agent:and i think we're going to i think we're going to be a president in a a presence in the Mideast from now on|user:um-hum	with the	0

agent:Cheney's hard core you don't get to be Secretary of Defense by being a wimp|user:as military minded as he is i mean|user:they're military people but i really didn't know that Cheney was	that's right i well he was what uh a Senator from Utah or something like that i can't remember where	1
user:yeah well unless they finally do take care of it themselves but|agent:i think we should have because_1 because_1 we're go[ing]- if we don't do it now we're going to have to do it shortly|user:uh	you know you kind of have to wonder whether it's going to be any better with uh you know depending on whether it Shiite Muslim or uh or the Kurds in power but uh	0
agent:you know in the Jimmy Car[ter]- uh Carter era you know wringing your hands and going trust me trust me|user:um-hum|agent:but we're going to have to be over there and we're and our presence is going to have to be felt and they've got to be strong presidents or presence uh if we don't then i think that we're going to be back there [noise]	[laughter]	1

agent:oh it sure can because_1 uh the you never just you just can never tell what it's going to do|user:a little bit interesting now and again|user:it it could get a little bit	uh-huh	1
user:that was bad news we're still|user:yeah that was|agent:right [laughter]	try i set out a whole bunch of crepe myrtles and stuff and of course it killed them_1	1
agent:and we're trying to decide what we want to do with our landscaping and we still have to put a yard in|user:um-hum|agent:and uh my wife and i are going through that process now we just bought a house	um-hum	1
agent:[laughter] that's worth planting huh|user:if it doesn't grow out in the woods here somewhere i'm not [laughter-sure]|agent:[vocalized-noise]	[vocalized-noise] plant yeah	1
user:and uh|agent:they sure have and that's a good tree it sort of stays green most of the year you know and|user:they seem to have done pretty good and	yeah it's it's it's a strange one it will kind of scare you if you don't know what it's doing because_1 right now is when it's dropping it's leaves	0
agent:huh well that's surprising|user:good conditions they'll grow about as fast as any tree|agent:so if you really fertilize it and	so	0
user:pin oaks and red oaks and all that sort of thing|user:i think the real honest to gosh oaks like the what bur oaks and|agent:right	they they'll grow a lot faster	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah i've gotten about three i guess|agent:gotten one at home huh	yeah [noise]	1
agent:but of course that's just my opinion [laughter]|agent:too much restriction on the uh on the Orientals also|agent:uh	yeah well i'm not real sure why i got this topic because	0
user:my uh my family is from|user:well uh|user:yeah	uh [noise] Europe	0
user:so i don't have any real strong ties with any|agent:uh-huh|user:several generations back that i am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family they were all they were all born here	with with the immigration laws i don't because i don't	1
user:i think it it would bring in a lot of uh|user:the United States become over populated well more over populated awfully quickly|user:not only would would	people that are run out of other countries or in trouble	0
user:but anyway i- i think that um|agent:okay|user:[noise] okay let's see i think uh i guess since i call i'm supposed to start i think that's the way everybody has done it so far	we are paying a lot in taxes	0
user:um the you know all the things that the government does like that|user:um the hospital stuff that the the government gives money to|user:you know as far as the quality of the streets the school systems	i uh i think they need to manage it a little bit better but	0
agent:yeah ours is seven point seven five [laughter-almost] eight and it drives me crazy i'm thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about we don't want a state income tax but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they don't do anything about it|user:or seven point something|agent:yeah	[noise] [laughter] yeah	1
agent:you just you just managed to escape the real Texan accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there|user:uh it's i don't know rural an urban area i guess whatever i don't know what i'm|user:so	yeah	1
user:the story where|user:i think even in the|user:you know even uh	uh they had to pay the taxes the disciples	0
agent:you know take as many deductions as i can that right and honest you know i don't want to pay more than i have to and and i get outraged sometimes when i feel like they go up for useless reasons but i believe that they're necessary you know|agent:but i you know i believe in paying taxes and i mean yeah like everybody else i try to|user:yeah	oh sure	1
user:um i have been married for just a few years so|user:i spends a lot of time with our income tax though this especially this year and last year|user:i we've	i've had to really switch around from the EZ form to the	0
agent:that's right|user:so i get twenty six paychecks|agent:uh-huh	which would come out to be in	0
user:um-hum|user:oh yeah|agent:and they did that they thought their payment is automatically taken out like every other Wednesday and that's exactly right even though the note is thirty years she said it's going be paid off in like twenty or twenty one years or something like that	right yeah	1
agent:well that's good though|user:try to make our decision by July|user:we're taking our time we're going uh	so and we just started like two or three weeks ago	1
agent:that's good|user:think of a better time to buy than now|user:i don't know we couldn't	but anyway	0
user:no|agent:no i didn't know any Walker's|user:at uh Cathy Walker	yeah but	0
user:yeah i'm i'm sort of|agent:okay so you work in back grind|agent:oh	an acting process engineer	1
agent:oh okay|user:the devices that we're making too|agent:good	which has made us as lot more stable	1
agent:you know the lower middle class and the upper middle class are having to carry the entire burden|agent:middle class and|agent:overall it just seem like they've modified the tax laws so bad just the last five years the rich is it's definitely case that the rich are getting richer and the working people	um-hum	1
user:welfare dollar needs to come back t[o]- to the local levels because the local people|user:i think the management of the|user:uh i know you don't ever cutout greed and corruption but	know exactly who needs that money and who doesn't need that money	0
user:um-hum|agent:i think by limiting the number of consecutive terms a congressman or senator can hold whether it be a state congressman or senator or at the national level limiting the two terms and then they've got to sit out one|user:um-hum	i think that's wonderful when do we first when do we then start giving them their lifetime income	0
agent:that don't want to increase taxes and they don't want to do this but every year they vote themselves in a very healthy pay raise|agent:and they're the ones that have screamed so mu[ch]- m[uch]- much about|user:yes i think you're right i don't think we should ever give them_1 a lifetime thing	it they don't they speak with fork and tongue don't [laughter-they]	1
agent:well in the form of capitalism that we've got apparently that's not working real good either|user:we know communism doesn't work what do we do next|user:you believe then that eventually there'll be an overthrow	uh i heard uh someone uh supposedly an authority say[ing]- speaking on TV saying that	0
user:are so protecting what they have in the budget that it doesn't seem to work that every man has to pay his own fair share and maybe that's why corporate America gets away with what they're doing|user:i think that the lobbyist uh|user:it doesn't seem to workout that way [laughter-though] [laughter-does] [laughter-it]	because of the kickbacks and et cetera	1
agent:it is the best system that's out there right now but it does need some fine tuning at this point|user:it's working right now though|user:uh with the elected officials i i'm not sure that uh	absolutely [laughter] nice talking to you	1
user:and uh it won't be too far from where we live and everybody's really been you know fighting against it because|agent:oh no|user:incinerator	we just we do not want it	0
agent:i you know what really [vocalized-noise] amazes me about like that Pasadena area and the oil refineries is|user:huh-uh|agent:yeah so it's just um you know why are why are we doing this to ourselves i just don't know but um	huh-uh	1
agent:um-hum|user:to begin with apparently it does cost more|agent:huh-uh	but once they get started	0
user:they're making fantastic amounts of money on these things and uh even the the incinerators|agent:yes|agent:uh-huh	the money and the income that they're going to make off of this is	1
agent:back in the east it's really|agent:up in the|user:huh-uh	you sound very young are you a young person	1
agent:uh-huh|user:they say it has really made a difference though|agent:it's so much better	now see we don't have that here yet	0
agent:we sure wouldn't want|user:um-hum|agent:it's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer and things	um-hum	1
agent:it's scary [laughter] it's scary|agent:no|agent:no	huh-uh	0

user:wake up to it in the morning this is my i guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning|user:i uh|user:my major source of information i guess is TV news [noise] excuse me	while i'm getting ready to go to work	1
user:well that's true but uh i|agent:uh the casualties were differently the amount of missiles launched were different and it was almost too much information over-communicated|agent:yes but when it came to the war issues it was like who's telling the truth you c[ould]- between the channels there was	[vocalized-noise] uh my personal opinion is that the uh the various network news [vocalized-noise] medias were uh	1
user:[laughter]|agent:um of course here at Texas Instruments uh the rumor mill runs rampant the secretary's probably are the best resource of what the layoff status is [laughter]|agent:the news is is spread	very true i find T News very enlightening	0
agent:hm|user:and i know what it takes to get some of those little bits a[nd]- of bits and pieces of news on the air|user:well i spent twenty years in prof[essional]- in uh commercial broadcasting ten in radio and then ten in uh TV	uh i mean there there are times where uh	1
agent:everybody got excited [noise]|agent:ouch|user:they left him alone	um-hum	1

user:uh|agent:huh|user:and i guess of all the all the ones i kind of prefer the air conditioned ones and the the not so roughing ones [laughter] with more entertainment than uh survival in mind	one of the times that we were at a uh state park	0
user:uh higher just a few weeks ago in fact uh a few weeks prior to when we got there and the|user:ten or so feet|user:so it was you know	camp the people at the campgrounds told us that uh asked where we were from and we said Dallas and they said oh well we had a girl die just two weeks ago in that rage of water	0
agent:uh as opposed to any of the other sorts|agent:[noise] i mostly do uh back packing|user:have you been camping much	um-hum	1
user:uh unless you go over toward East Texas where there's a co[nsiderable]- considerable amount of woods or if you go|agent:huh|user:you know you can go two hundred miles and your probably in the same kind of environment you [laughter-were] in when you left so	uh extreme south part where there's some some things worth seeing by foot	0
agent:and just get three days from any place that's civilization|agent:areas|agent:you know {bushwack} or go on semi trailed	huh	1
user:i'm doing all right and|user:laid down inside one of them and was just about asleep when a little voice from outside the tent said uh asked if i was doing all right and i said huh yeah yeah do[ing]- doing just fine you know it's a little windy but|user:and about uh oh a little after midnight we got all these tents set up and i	and they suggested that i come out that mine was the only tent that hadn't fallen down yet and sure enough after i got out of there a little bit it blew down and	0
agent:we can laugh about it i mean your not laughing about it then [laughter-too] [laughter-much] you know i mean you know afterwards it's it's it's kind of a nice memory to|user:yeah|user:yeah	yeah that's for sure	1
user:uh so we see uh the ones that have been out for a while|agent:yeah|user:i was just thinking about what movies i've seen lately mostly uh [noise] we go to uh the second or third run movies i guess what the ones that we call the doll[ar]- used to call the dollar movies	i was trying to think what the last movie that we went to see was probably Russia House with uh Sean Connery	0
user:yeah so|agent:i haven't seen any of that stuff really|agent:it's been	uh so you so then you're not a uh uh not a frequent movie goer either	1
agent:yeah and some of them that turned to flops we saw other other other night we saw um Lady in Red|user:yeah that's that's a little bit too much so|agent:i mean fifteen bucks to go see a movie with t[wo]- with a couple's a little ridiculous	but	1
agent:um-hum|user:four to six of those on a weekend|user:and we don't find a lot of those uh you know they'll be running uh	and	0
agent:kind of drab|user:not satirical wasn't funny at all but it was|user:i don't know uh	i don't know had a had a lot of hidden meanings in it i suppose but uh	0
agent:great|user:before so i- i- i thought it was a real good movie|agent:is it a good movie	um	0
agent:um-hum|user:you could kind of anticipate what was going to be said so i- i had a little bit advantage there over my wife she had not read the book|user:so you if you knew what was going on	but uh	1
agent:you know it was cold in the theater and it's wet in the movie and they kind of just it was it was comfortable it was easy to go in you didn't have to think a lot and and uh|agent:but it was uh|user:um-hum	[laughter]	1
agent:so wh[at's]- what's your prediction on North Carolina and Duke|user:yep|agent:all right there we go	well	0
user:[laughter]|user:i -[do]n't know|agent:well U[NLV]- they say UNLV may be the greatest amateur team ever	they beat Duke's [vocalized-noise] ass last year	1
agent:and uh|agent:oh yeah him and Worthy|user:Magic	AC Green's pretty good	1
user:huh|agent:he took the shot if he makes it he's a hero if he misses it he's a goat he made it|agent:the[y]- they gave him the ball	well he made it	0
user:yeah|agent:[noise] well they're so close to an un[defeated]- undefeated season they can taste it and they wanna make history so i don't think they're gonna lack for motivation|user:pretty good	Duke'll be mighty mad though [laughter]	1
agent:well this has been fun i've enjoyed talking with you|user:huh|agent:ye[ah]- yeah so you don't really get to keep the the nucleus of your best talent for the whole four years	okay	1
agent:um-hum|user:uh certainly you know there could be advantages and things to be learned [laughter]|agent:um-hum	but on the other hand	0
user:yeah yeah|agent:and i mean i i even think that that sort of experience is worth a lot more than reading a textbook sometimes|agent:people are feeling like they're getting something out of it too but that certainly everyone else would be getting something out of them participating and	well and probably too even those who	0
agent:i- i i know i mean i wish i was lucky enough to not want to work [laughter] you know [laughter]|user:yeah i don't understand that either that's|user:um-hum	that's tough	1
agent:um-hum|user:beginning you know their life in that respect they might|agent:um-hum	you know get off on some other track but	0
agent:bad in some other way|agent:or you know because they were|user:yeah	yeah	0
EMPTY	hi Phil	1
agent:ouch|user:where i- i had a lot of things that i thought that i needed to do that were more important than than spending time with my children in fact when they were younger|user:uh	uh i was attending school	1
agent:uh things i would like to have done differently on uh on the kids though|agent:i can think of a uh|agent:i guess uh	well i can think of of some enjoyable things that that i did with the kids like we used to go up to uh New Hampshire quite a bit and go to the uh	0
agent:and uh pick them_1 up and carry them_1 there and that kind of thing|agent:tried to get me to do that i [laughter] but we'd go you know and watch them practice and|user:uh-huh	did you spend as much time with your daughter as you did with your sons	1
user:uh playing someplace|user:um i spent a lot of time with her when i was home uh she'd always be the one you know sitting on my lap or being close to me and the two guys would be off uh|agent:yeah	but it seems like whenever i wanted to do something like go out [noise] for the kids and uh	0
user:i remember when i first took my kids out uh fishing and again i was with my two sons and not with my daughter but uh no i was with my oldest son uh my youngest son wasn't old enough or i didn't think he was old enough to take out|agent:he's gotten now to where he can take it better he'll dish it back a little bit but [laughter]|user:[laughter]	and uh	0
agent:how do they pay for it how is it financed|user:done and accepted|user:it's not anything that seems to be um you know costing everybody a lot of money it's not a major topic of conversation it's just something that's	well um	0
agent:and you know even though the insurance is paying eighty percent of it you're pay an arm and a leg for the insurance first of all and then you're still paying yeah the twenty percent and so|user:um-hum|user:um	um-hum	1
agent:their free hospitals or whatever and i know a few people that have had experiences in those|agent:their you know|agent:every city has you know	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|agent:you know it's worthwhile to itemize and and last year i was the first [laughter-year] we reached that mark|user:um-hum	oh you did	1
agent:you know offer you know you can have a certain amount deducted pre tax from your pay check for medical expenses but not covered by insurance but|user:i[t]- it's just crazy|agent:oh it's out it's outrageous and then a lot of companies	yes	1
agent:yeah|user:you know they're they're going to work every day because they're not sick|user:you know they're not stealing for money to pay for their doctors' bills	you know i mean just something that should be more of a priority than it is now	1
agent:have to be headed in that direction|user:um-hum|user:yeah	um-hum	1
agent:okay|user:um one of them's Quantum Leap|user:and they kind of are in different spectrums i think	and the other one is Night Court	1
user:he is [laughter]|agent:Dan Fielding was just too too vulgar and too crude for me [laughter] and and i told my husband that's the whole point but [laughter] i i just it's|agent:i used to think um	yeah that's right	0
agent:Deedee was in there yes|user:Deedee|agent:and i i like the old ser[ies]- series better when um	yeah i agree	1
agent:um-hum|user:uh it seemed like it was almost two different organizations you know like like Hunter was the boss and and this other girl was not and|user:would decide that one of them_1 would go do this while the other one would do would go this but	you know you kind of	0
agent:um-hum|user:which which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners you know and that that i kind of thought was good but um|user:to where you never really knew	you know it's i[t]- i guess	0
user:the the last day all they did was the last season|user:well|user:all the Get Smart episodes you could ever see	to where the two of them_1 got married	0
agent:um-hum|user:um well like i said this one about uh Max or Get Well Smart uh the female character uh Barbara Feldon|user:couple of examples would be	she had been at the beginning the the intelligent one the the one who ev[eryone]- always solved the things and and figured out and kept	0
agent:i've seen it before but i don't watch it regularly usually Tuesday nights i'm out so|user:it's uh that's on Tuesday nights i think|user:what is that show uh Who's the Boss	yeah the well i yeah i hardly ever watch it but uh as as i've seen it	0
agent:um-hum|user:now like Madonna and Sean Penn now i don't particularly like either one of them_1 but um|user:yeah	uh their marriage was so highly publicized	0
user:so um|agent:yeah|user:well that's kind of interesting	well i gue[ss]- i guess that's about all we need to do isn't it	1
agent:yeah|agent:uh-huh|user:we don't have cable so we were watching C N N a lot and then trying to switch thank goodness for remote control	we were switching from one station to another and in between keeping the radio on	1
user:it did yeah it was like you know|agent:yeah after a while though it started getting a little repetitive it ran out of news [vocalized-noise]|user:yeah yeah you just couldn't you couldn't put it d[own]- you couldn't put it down	that what was it	0
user:yeah that's funny because every once in a while if my husband and i have traveled or something|agent:oh it's it's it's not even a [laughter-comparison]|user:how does it how does compare have you can you com[pare]- like how does it compare to the Post	um and we pick up a local paper we're really	0
agent:finding the latest thing out from my friends is usually the most uh time [laughter-effective]|user:yeah|agent:i wouldn't have time to read it so i'm	yeah yeah no i can remember way back back in those days when i was in school	0
user:uh-huh|agent:[noise] yeah some of it got a little i- i don't know i thought it was a little too personal that they were digging each other life|user:that was probably the best part of the news was the uh some of the person human interest stories	yeah yeah	1
agent:yeah you shouldn't even worry about most of the stuff i mean i don't know|user:over[load]- news [laughter-overload]|agent:it's almost getting to the point where there is there's too much that	yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:you know because_1 she would be sleeping so i would be here then|agent:and then that night it wouldn't need one	yeah that would seem like that would be uh more expensive than a uh	1
agent:and it just depends on how bad that person is|user:yeah|agent:walking you know	well seems to me if a person gets into that area	1
agent:because she was always cold|agent:and you know bed[spread]- her bedspread sh[e]- i took her a bedspread because sh[e]- a comforter|user:yeah	yeah	1
agent:and it's really not some people don't need to be in there|agent:that's about what it's for|agent:sometimes i think some people put them in there and then they just die	you know that's what i've heard too you know i heard that they just put them_1 in there because they don't want to mess with them	1
agent:for what they did to somebody but|agent:or maybe that won't not make it that far in life|agent:yeah	well	0
agent:but now my mom and them had to pay for that too|user:yeah|agent:but it was a nice nursing home for you know it was one of the nice ones	yeah i was going to say you have to pay something like three and four times more	1

user:yeah|user:yeah|user:yeah	but uh it's just	0
agent:[laughter] that's how i keep looking at it|user:yeah|agent:that's right but you can't take this money with us though	[noise]	0
agent:yeah|user:i mean it's like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know one thousand four hundred dollars to send your|agent:oh yeah if you can['t]- if you can yeah	child to college you know	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:oh|user:he was just so bad off you know from not being able to stay up here that	his life just went down the drain so	1
user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter] well that's a good way to look at it|agent:[laughter-oh] jeez	i always do that i got to do something like that with the weather	1
agent:oh really|user:i'm from southern California|user:well see i would prefer the cold	but see the heat out here [laughter] [laughter-ain't] nothing	1

agent:yeah and i gue[ss]- i guess that's shows what they say about Dallas if you don't like the weather just just wait a day yeah it'll change on you|agent:no it's uh|user:[laughter] but that's that's tornado season	wait a while it'll change	1
agent:yeah that's [vocalized-noise] matter fact that's one of my favorite hobbies is uh reading|agent:[laughter-oh] [laughter-yeah]|user:that long [laughter] we won't talk about that [laughter]	yeah	1
agent:he's uh i read those uh actually i think my favorite author really right now is uh William Johnstone|agent:[laughter]|user:you're not talking your Danielle Steele female by any means but on the other hand um i won't uh i can't uh Sidney Sheldon's does come off the shelf [laughter] for light reading for	um-hum	1
user:that's exactly what happened to us we were living um in Minneapolis at the time and we were getting ready to come back to Texas um|agent:yeah we got at TI to drive into town and almost buy it undercover at the time they were doing it|user:no i didn't but i- i- i have it and i haven't read it	and	0
user:yeah in fact i just started her a friend a friend of ours turned me on to that i always i always looked at spy novels and went eh [laughter]|user:uh yeah|agent:have you read Tom Clancy	military stuff just never really did anything to me unless it was history	1
agent:neophyte|agent:there was just too much detail there for the for the|agent:yeah oh yeah it's	anything to be real interesting yeah well it's good to talk to somebody i don't read as much as i used to um	0
agent:he's heavy into Japanese culture uh along with uh the Ninja the arts of Ninja and uh all all the various uh martial arts|user:oh okay|agent:oh yeah oh no he no he's uh he's heavy into Japanese culture	does he tell it in narrative form or in third person how does he present it	1
agent:uh you'll then you'll like O'Leary he's he's he's quite good at it i've got into one that i didn't think i would it's a i'm not it's a kind of a historical Indian novel thing by Donald Colesmith|user:no that's more no that's not i do actually i like Asian cultures [vocalized-noise] that why i was that's funny that you mentioned that|user:uh	um-hum	1
EMPTY	[noise]	0
agent:yeah|user:well you've got [laughter] a moral problem and an economic one|user:and in a case like that uh where	uh	0
user:uh murder|user:if well uh i thi[nk]- i think it's it's only uh it only applies to ce[rtain]- a very few types of crimes|user:i don['t]- i don't really know about that uh uh	and i think kidnapping could carry death penalty as well	1
user:to the rest of uh the population or or you can put them_1 out of everybody's misery uh i don't know|user:i guess you've got a choice either you do life in prison or you can institutionalize somebody forever uh where they're not a threat to|user:well [laughter]	it's it's a real moral dilemma	0
agent:and he was the one that was petitioning to have have you know himself executed|user:uh-huh|agent:Gary Gilmore was the one who was arrested and uh found guilty of i think two or three murders in Utah Pro[vo]- outside of Provo	okay	1
agent:and then what do you do about the the thing that you know the the the was it one tenth of one percent chance that they might have been convicted erroneously|user:i don't believe that they're given a chance to uh do anything productive or even uh mix with the rest of the prison community|user:well people who tend to be say on death row th[ey]- i think they're kept in isolation all the time	right well [laughter] it's it's it's real small but uh like i said i mean the death penalty could probably be justified if if the evidence	0
agent:yeah some of them i had for two days|user:my gosh|agent:you know when we lived in Boston i had eleven cars stolen	yeah	1
user:uh if it's first degree murder|user:uh yeah well i think it depends on what the crime is uh you're not going to sentence somebody to death for stealing a car|agent:by fellow jurors	or uh	1
agent:even if they you know claim that they're are rehabbed|user:sure|agent:yeah but the code of ethics that's learned in prison is s[o]- so bent and twisted that you wonder when they get out of there	w[ell]-	1
user:and uh|user:his case comes up every few years now i guess|user:sure well case like Charles Manson he's uh he's been eligible for parole a couple of times already	people have to uh stand up and uh denounce him again	0
user:um|user:uh i enjoy it|agent:uh-huh	the gardens are kind of old you have to step down in them_1 now that the	0
agent:um|agent:whatever it was i- i c[ouldn't]- there was a second there i couldn't even hear what you were saying but|agent:well i- i don't know there was well	yeah i was beating on the phone going can you hear me so	1
user:she plans it all out|user:she puts a lot of financial|agent:uh-huh	beans like to be near certain types of plants now they they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like uh peas i don't know	0
agent:no it's just the like the bees and insects will do it|user:but i don't think the vines have they don't really they don't have to be touching or anything like you say they cross pollinate just by bees|agent:huh	oh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:with some topsoil|user:i have to do that i want to make some flowerbeds and i'm going to have a seven yard truck come in	and i'm going to a	0
agent:[laughter]|user:yeah this house that i have is just a three bedroom ranch and i can tell you there's nothing around it cement foundation all the way round it not a shrub not a bush|agent:well it's not that you can see it a little better and it stands out	there was a lilac tree and the landlord cut it down and	0
agent:yeah because_1 it like i- i think i've seen those before but i don't remember what they look like|user:if if the trees hang down so low and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns [laughter-on] [laughter-it]|user:and i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back which we said we'd do	so	1
agent:it's really good that we did well|agent:feeling about it uh|agent:well it's it's a real mixed um	um-hum	1
user:and uh his motivations are i don't feel like he was absolutely on the up and up with us on you know the mot[ivation]- the true motivation he talks a lot about|agent:yeah|agent:Yale	the new world order	0
agent:right|user:i don't know everything i don't mu[ch]- you could watch news all the time but you don't know anything hardly|user:and uh that's where that's why i really don't have a real set opinion because	and he did talk about that though he did uh he at least he did mention it you know what i'm saying	0
agent:during the whole war he never put out like a c[onservation]- a conservation effort for oil|user:uh-huh|user:um-hum	um-hum	0
user:that's just a real good thing but i think it's something that's going to happen but|user:i just don't see that um|user:this one world this new world order that him and Gorbachev keep talking about	i guess that's what i feel happen with the war and that was the motive of the war was to try and break that up and so that they could be	0
user:i don't know just i mean i would pr[obably]- most people probably think i don't even have a high school education you know because of my attitude about it but i just feel like there's so much going on|agent:[laughter]|user:oh my money's in the stock market oh i can't believe they're doing this but it doesn't change anything so i'm just like	that you know hey i'm going to pray about it and [laughter] if i feel led to	0
user:and so it was you know we just went from one extreme to the other you know and|agent:oh|user:and so when we [laughter] you know we're on the way to home church and the bombing's just begun you know and we go into this birthday party for a surprise party	it was like kind of s[ad]- it was like man this is really hard you know i want to watch the war	0
agent:yeah yeah|user:i know i talked to some guy who was i talked to some of the yuppie types you know and they're pretty interesting but yeah they're real opinionated but i guess that's better than nothing you know|agent:yeah [laughter]	but any[way]- yeah it's been interesting though all these different people and some of them_1 are real friendly you know and it's like yeah man when i come to Dallas i'll call you you know and then others of them_1 are like they just wanna go but then some of them_1 have babies crying in the background too so	0
user:so i was just [laughter-going] wait a minute we're supposed to be talking about fishing now stop but|user:[laughter] how much [laughter-do] [laughter-you] make up in Rhode Island|agent:[laughter]	yep anyway is that funny but we did talk about fishing though so	0
agent:right yeah|user:that's one thing that that's that's crime that you can't fight it if you need that money|user:that's one thing that	so	1
user:and what we have here in Burlington which it doesn't cost a lot of money but they have a kids|agent:uh-huh|user:well what they what they say they try to do is to get the kids um early and young	council	0
user:it's not|user:if i had a child that that that did things so bad|user:i mean i guess we everybody's responsible for the society but	they don't care about anybody	0
user:it it it's|agent:uh-huh|user:like you're judging us and i'm not good enough to raise my child which basically is true	i'm glad i don't live in a big city	1
user:[laughter-i] [laughter-mean] that's you you're gonna have to expect that to happen people are just|agent:yeah|agent:uh-huh	totally unfeeling	0
user:pretty basic uh|user:organization um so my benefits are|agent:uh-huh	medical	0
user:where you have more control and allocate uh like you can|user:you know flex flexible benefits|user:now offering	uh	0
agent:well people with families have different objectives than single people or|user:individual needs which i think is the most important thing because everybody is got quite a few different|user:flexible to meet	objectives	1
agent:i think it's three fifty a year for the family|agent:and then uh the deductible's reasonable|agent:is [vocalized-noise] the hospitalization medical care benefits is what we like the best um because it's a good well rounded program it's you know just eighty percent	uh-huh	1
agent:um-hum|user:well i think uh obviously i think the the medical is the most expensive or it's the most important|user:yeah	uh coverage uh	1
agent:or maybe it's fifty percent up to eighty percent|agent:up to four percent|user:okay	yeah	1
agent:you know about insurance [laughter] i didn't know anything about insurance until i had got [laughter-until] [laughter-i] [laughter-had] [laughter-children]|agent:yeah yeah that's what it is|user:yeah	[laughter]	1
user:uh replacing those uh whole life policies which aren't very good insurance policies|user:a marketing organization that marketed|user:involved in a	people are losing you know and it	0
agent:uh-huh|user:uh what your benefits would be and uh the difference between you know the the term life with annuity and the whole life|user:uh what would happen you know at this age this age this age you know	was you know there's fairly big dis[crepancies]- discrepancies you know	0
user:but uh|agent:[laughter]|user:you know i don't know what i get out maybe twenty thou[sands]- or something just to cover me and cover some expenses and maybe fly people out that i know you know some family that	i'm not worried about that i don't have anybody to	0
user:you know that's fine but uh|user:and|user:yeah i mean i'm not looking to to leave anything there may be a a certain amount uh	uh you know	0
user:what else is im[portant]- important uh obviously i think uh|user:but uh anyway as far as benefits um|agent:[laughter]	a profit sharing is is uh	1
user:but um|user:um|user:um i guess you could technically consider that profit sharing	most you know most medium or small	0
agent:yes we uh uh i haven't missed a one since i've been eligible to vote|user:okay did you vote in the last uh national election	oh that's good	1
agent:but uh so i don't know i it'll be interesting to see how the next uh|user:it really was yeah|user:yeah really especially in Texas [laughter]	it was a mess	1
agent:right if you don't go and vote then you know very good chance that they they will|user:next thing you know you've got him [laughter]|agent:um-hum	yeah	1
agent:but uh|agent:so uh|user:yeah i'm in Dallas and they're long here too so	yeah i voted absentee one year i really was going to be	0
agent:then i'll i'll vote for the party [laughter] if i know you know something about the other guy or you know they're both just as bad then i'll say well|agent:but uh if it uh gets down between two|user:uh-huh	yeah [laughter]	1
agent:and|user:well i can't think of anything else|agent:no they don't	really about the polls or voting	1
agent:and uh i think i think we'd be totally bankrupt if we didn't do something|user:oh yeah|agent:and we're our kid we've got the kids who are at the stage where they need to take piano lessons and and uh you know play baseball and and do all those fun things	[laughter]	1
agent:uh but|user:yeah|agent:we uh you know we're not going to get this budget isn't going to make us rich but it is going to prevent us from going into poverty	which is easy to do	0
agent:especially when it comes time and the kids are grown up and they're they want to do things like go to college uh you don't want to say well we're still paying for the mistake we made twenty years ago you know and|agent:yeah you don't want to|agent:um	[laughter]	1
user:[noise]|user:right|agent:well you know the the i'm i'm also hoping that this budget process will rub off on them because uh when i grew up i had no	exactly	1
agent:okay well is your does your city have mandatory re[cycling]- uh recycling|user:okay we we can uh be recorded while we talk about it	no we don't have mandatory we actually we're kind of slow up here	0
agent:mills but uh you have to go to Houston and uh it's interesting and then there's places that'll buy metal and they still buy aluminum can in fact that|agent:yeah well see that's in in Dallas there there no plan to build i think that there's some in East Texas there's some pulp|agent:well	do you have to buy metal copper is a very uh good one to collect even aluminum yeah so	1
agent:um|agent:so it's a question should i be diligent and um|agent:sell and uh	and recycle	1
user:um if if if they're pretty clean and stuff so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months and i get a whole bunch of them_1 and bring them_1 over and bring them_1 over now if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean like if you said wash all the cans and things i wouldn't mind if it sat around too much but if|user:well i think i- i would be like when i bring my bottles back|agent:you know it it it's not a very high priority thing to go haul these uh containers over there	if it stunk or something i wouldn't like doing it	0
agent:oh|user:like our uh frui[t]- fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit|user:well that's that's a really good idea because um	it	0
agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:well|agent:but it it was it was actually legal	yes well	0
user:mostly deep sea fishing for|user:huh|agent:oh really	grouper and bottom fish	1
user:a certain period of time during the year they have|user:and um|agent:right	all along the gulf coast from	0
user:uh|user:nothing i think i've been trout fishing once|agent:uh-huh	i've never fly fished have you fly fished	1
user:uh fishing|user:my|user:ended snagging	partners or	0
user:you know there are|agent:right|user:mostly for relaxation	there are people who fish and then there are people who catch	0
agent:and i i fish to take home and cook [laughter] i don't i don't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching i get a little bit of relaxation from it but mainly i wanna i want to say i brought something [laughter-home] i want to say i did this i was out there for a reason [laughter]|agent:that's really about it mostly just the lakes around here|agent:and um	[laughter]	1
user:party boat a few years ago and we we were grouper fishing|user:i was out on a|user:i have been	or you know actually we were uh snapper fishing	1
agent:[laughter]|user:that's right i would go from one side of the boat to the other and uh|agent:you couldn't catch one to save your life [laughter-right]	the uh the party boat captain could not understand	1
user:they do of course you know here in um|user:and uh|agent:yeah	we're only just a you know few	0
agent:and of course there's no hook so it can't be a fish i'm i'm sure it's not a fish right|agent:something grabs and just runs with it|agent:and something i had a rock to weight it down	um-hum	1
user:and it has a huge strong mouth and they actually uh|agent:i've never heard of that one|user:they have a fish that's called an oyster cracker i don't know if you've ever heard of it	use their teeth to open	0
user:uh|user:up to|agent:um-hum	i guess the la[rgest]- largest one i ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long	0
agent:[noise] uh	[noise] uh interestingly enough in my younger days i taught school for two years while my husband was getting his business established	0
agent:yeah what what do you said you think there're some improvements what do you think the improvements have been|user:had a problem with it i guess i've just gotten a little tired of fighting|user:of discipline uh although i've never	i think uh the quality of education in the high school system here is better i think the teachers that we have now are more professional	0
user:Dallas or Chicago or even Indianapolis which is a couple hours south of us|user:so the setting is very different than it would be in|agent:um-hum	uh but to me	0
user:uh-huh|agent:how well the job's getting done|agent:instead of worrying about saving jobs or raising salaries i think we need to worry about uh	isn't that the way with most groups though they become a self-protection thing	0
agent:yeah that's in in small communities that's a difficult choice but then the small communities are the ones with fewer problems|user:except we don't have another school|agent:if the parents don't like the way the school is being run the appropriate action is to have the choice to take that kid out of that school and put him in a different school	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah|user:i think really uh the school does have more of that student's time because eight hours of the time that the student is with the parent they're going to be sleeping|agent:um-hum	and certainly the parent needs some social life	0
agent:yes [vocalized-noise] that was going to be my guess|user:[laughter] well this is basketball in Indiana so|agent:and here here in Texas if you don't like football you're considered a heretic	uh-huh We do all have our sport In fact we've been on a real high here because our basketball team won their regional for the first time in the history of the school	0
agent:[laughter] yeah [laughter]|user:hours you know we he had been in graduate school so i was used to his not being home at all [laughter] so i was you know didn't want him to have a job that|user:and some of the things that were important to me m[y]- uh when my husband was looking for his job was um	would make him	0
agent:they're sort of like clinics you know uh but this was just an HMO where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular hospitals and all that but it was with a certain list of|agent:it was um not that kind of HMO's where you have to go to their|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:the other one|agent:do you have the basic plan or do you have the|user:just checked all over and	we have um you know we're at Aetna with uh an [vocalized-noise] we have like the	1
agent:um-hum|user:well my husband does not like to commute very far|user:um	and	0
user:him to let you know to like we had some job offers in the New York area|agent:right|user:e[specially]- especially when they finish all the construction out here and we didn't want	and we thought well you know he would be really commuting [laughter]	0
user:that's really important|agent:[noise]|user:um-hum that's true	um also what um opportunities there would be for advancement	0
agent:but|user:uh-huh|agent:just one of the things that that happens when someone when you're dealing with a large company	but	0
agent:how long has he been in his present position|user:work under tho[se]-|user:thinking he could um	oh just since l[ast]- last summer	0
user:and being when we were down in Houston we were isolated i mean it's not that far but|user:and so he we have a lot of family here his side of the family|agent:uh-huh	people would ha[ve]- we didn't have anyone in town that was our family	0
user:oh that's nice|user:[laughter]|user:[laughter]	yeah and it is i think it is important to	1
agent:[noise]	[noise]	0
agent:water [laughter] type situation|agent:there's a lot of industry around but uh it's not it's any pollution that industry's dumping around here is not going into the air it's typically|agent:you know there's uh	yeah	0
agent:the whole idea is not to not to push the limit too hard i guess l[et]- let the you know let the natural|agent:it|agent:and uh it will clean itself up eventually	um-hum	1
agent:and uh|user:yeah|user:um-hum	yeah we have tried i mean you know	0
agent:i do not think one appeal is everybody's entitled to one appeal|agent:no|user:um do you think one appeal is is too stringent	okay	1
user:treating the prisoners so-called brutally because uh|user:the the legislature just come out and said that because of what with|user:so	the state prison's overcrowded	0
user:you get some of the jury trials|user:but yet|user:is that the judges are too lenient	and	1
user:in Rhode Island|user:but like|user:and the other thing is i'm not sure about Texas	if someone breaks into your home	1
user:what choice have you got|user:so|user:that's what you should do	you know as far as as far as	1
user:but he knows he's going to go back and do the same thing over again|user:and so he was under the influence of narcotics at that time when when the act was was performed|user:right	you know	0
agent:that should be automatic death penalty no if ands or buts|user:you deserve to be killed also|user:rob a gas station or a drug store and you shoot somebody	right	1
user:the guy that got out of prison here to go to a mafia um swearing in ceremony|user:um|user:they just had this uh i don't know if it's been in your newspapers but	and they got uh	1
user:that these people are murderers and whatever else you got and yet they're not going to let that evidence in you know as admissible evidence in court|user:but they know outright|user:where this meeting took place so there's a technicality there	so that has to be looked at too	0
user:yeah because you look at the statistics now and i'm sure it's in your your newspapers just like it is in ours|user:more and more people|agent:we've gone too far to the left it's fixing to come back hard right	that	0
agent:thank uh federal judge named William Wayne Justice|user:that's incredible|agent:i've got to let him hit me before i can hit him back to be justified have it called what they call a justified use of force	do you uh	0
user:oh okay|agent:oh it it it all boiled down to when the opening for this came up it was the best deal going it was paying so much more money than what i was making before i couldn't turn it down|user:[laughter]	is it uh was it uh civil service	1
agent:i guess um the one time that i saw him there you know as far as the surroundings that seemed okay|agent:um|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:yeah i know because_1 i've always well my sister's involved in one also and i really think they really do a wonderful job|user:yeah|agent:but still i'm sure there are you know aspects to it that aren't really desirable	but still there's those little	0
agent:walk in on your own in other words you can't be in you know too bad a shape to start out with but then if you deteriorate|agent:um|agent:in order to get in you have to be able to	yeah yeah	1
agent:so i don't like that aspect|agent:[laughter-you] [laughter-know]|user:uh-huh the very same yeah	yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:and still has her own home and everything|agent:yeah yeah my mother's uh seventy five	i think that's wonderful i really do just as long as they can and then on the other hand i've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy	0

agent:no i just|user:you don't|agent:no we don't	well	1
agent:these kind of things are about a hundred dollars a year so yo[u]- you know these are all equivalent to the monthly budget things some of them_1 are there to pacify situations and some of them_1 are there to prevent things from happening|agent:um car insurance in case you run into a lawyer and you break his arm he's going to sue the pants off of you|agent:okay you should always have an umbrella permit that bridges your uh life insurance and your medical and your um	um-hum	1
user:we you know we have a lot for to be our age and|agent:[laughter]|user:you know uh and we have a nine and a half year old son and it's because_1 you know we were eighteen when we had him so we're we're kind of looking at this from the other aspect of	you know just everything and having the responsibilities we've had on us for at such a young age	0
agent:if you go up there and write them a two thousand dollar check it doesn't all go towards principal|user:um-hum|agent:two thousand dollars left let's say on on the loan	um-hum	1

agent:sure|agent:oh really|user:and he want yeah he just told me this last week that he he said don't you remember i asked them to finance it at four years and they came back and they said that they had it figured for five and we'd already signed the papers and i maybe i might have been there i don't remember hearing that but i also wasn't the one in charge of it so i wasn't paying as close of attention	but anyway instead of putting our foot down about it we just went okay whatever you know so anyway so next time we'll do that different we want to next time pay cash for our car too	0
agent:sev[en]- i'm sorry seven to nine years off the end of the loan and there are there is a local firm that'll actually if if like in my situation i don't have that because the loan was not available|user:right|user:right	right	1

user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	okay uh	0
user:innocent until proven guilty|user:i r[eally]- i really agree with the uh|user:sure before you convict somebody	theory i think that's	1
agent:and there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing but the way our system our court system works|agent:uh you know that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say you know your pleasure your honor|user:right	yeah	1
user:the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know how|user:you know those kinds of things and|user:big lengthy uh twelve person ju[ry]- jury or do they need a six person jury or	is this open and shut you know like you were saying or	0
agent:either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case|agent:and let|user:yeah	yeah right that	1
user:true in a lot of our um|user:you know that whole Biblical concept like that that's|user:but uh	you know the the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that it doesn't	0
agent:uh that's sort of the Old Testament version|agent:i guess the the Lord started out with we'll treat you f[airly]- i'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what i say|agent:uh	yeah that's	0
agent:well that's quite all right|user:oh okay in in Texas okay i was just being curious|agent:i'm living here in Texas	okay	0
user:yeah um i i suspect the apathy is is due to something|agent:the apathy exists i blame it to apathy|user:i i	like people just feeling that that their vote doesn't count anyway i mean why why bother voting if	0
agent:and i i think the you hear the news you know you start out in the morning and all day you hear the news and by time say you get off work and go to vote you feel like it doesn't make any difference|user:um that's true actually i never thought about that that that's a good rea[son]-|agent:is the news me[dia]- media puts such a blitz on it that they've uh they had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting you know	that's true that's true	1
user:so people think that that that they don't have|user:that well what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now and you know and stuff like that|user:um and i think wrongly figuring that	um	0
user:you know and i think that's probably a portion of the population that's massively under represent[ed]- i i i would guess|user:i think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me i'm just a little nobody my vote's not going to count anyway|user:yeah that that's possible i still think that that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference though as well	that tha[t]- that portion of the population is massively under represented	0
user:no i think|agent:that's a good point you're probably right|user:likes rights probably but doesn't like respon[sibilities]- responsibilities	i mean that's that's what it what it boils down to is people like to s[ay]- you know	0
agent:total indifference you know what difference does it make back|user:right that that's true [laughter]|agent:or any one shows up	right	1
agent:oh and i think women turn out to vote for women too|user:yeah i think and i i think that's real important|agent:even if they lose	that's probably true	1
agent:i think i did vote for her as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure i did|user:and i i suspect she could get a large voter turnout|user:that that's that's that's very good that's i i like that so i would uh i would i would vote for her without	say i i i would think that um	0
agent:what the sto[ry]- the actual facts are at this point i don't i don't really know if some of the poor judges that are just trying to decide how it should be divided|user:yes|agent:even the news you cannot follow	um-hum	1
user:well in some sense they they should be politicians in that you know you want them to respect the people and you don't want them to have|agent:are they politicians|user:that['s]- that's true that's true well [vocalized-noise]	you don't want a judge to be appointed because you don't want someone's friend to be a judge	1
user:to go out and make inflammatory and ridiculous and stupid statements|user:who you never expect to win|user:and the way to do it is to get an absolutely atrocious candidate	so that a large population of of of voters will go out and vote against that person for someone else	0
agent:but like wh[en]- like when i'm down at home and like somebody says okay when are when are we having this you know and i'll and i'll cook it|user:uh-huh|agent:oh no well see what happens is i'm only twenty two	yeah	1

agent:okay|user:and you fry them with garlic and a little bit of couple dashes of hot pepper|agent:okay	and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry	1
agent:okay|user:just stir fry the ground beef drain off the oil use the same hoi sin sauce and um some of the frozen mixed vegetables|agent:okay	just stir that in and you've got a very colorful side	0
user:well first i think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to|agent:information about selecting a school|agent:what do you think you would offer as far as uh	what they want to do	0
user:um|agent:uh-huh|user:aren't really concerned with your first two years anyway it's it's your core education your general requi[rements]- general education requirements	if you know if they want to get a liberal arts degree i don't	1
agent:uh-huh|user:i didn't know what i wanted to do after i got my my degree|user:yeah it does Um	um originally i had planned	1

agent:so it's a|user:yeah|user:oh good grief	yeah i thought at one time i wanted to be a teacher but i i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet	0
user:oh yeah|user:yeah you going|agent:you know what's going to happen when she gets there you know all of her dreams will be dispelled [laughter]	Yeah if if if you've ever seen the program paper chase	0

agent:yeah and uh then after after this month it'll quickly get get hot you know i mean Mar[ch]- April May it has a lot of rain uh May has quite a bit of rain and uh by May we're hitting in the eighties sometimes even l[ow]- low nineties uh but we don't really get the bad humidity here until July and August those are our worst months|user:hum well yeah that's i heard that|agent:somewhere around there that that's the best time to see them and they don't last too long [laughter-you] know	um-hum	1
agent:um-hum|user:well it's it's um it depends on what part of the south i think the farther east you go you know from from here on east|agent:but uh i always wondered about the South i figured that there couldn't be too many months [laughter-that] [laughter-that] trees were were bare because it's it's hot most of the time	uh you do have a a limited winter	0
agent:yes|agent:yeah|user:um but it you know it's still not cold cold here	uh compared to what he's used to so	1
user:um-hum|agent:oh but anyway well i that's that's about all [vocalized-noise] you know i have right here on on this area so|agent:[laughter] yeah [laughter-that] is pretty [laughter-good]	okay well	0
user:it's strange because|user:so um|agent:jeez	it it so hit so close to home	1
user:um we don't have that problem up here we might maybe in a rural|agent:yeah|user:yeah you don't know if their complaints are legitimate	uh maybe there's a bad uh a bad home in a rural area but it would be a very small one	0
user:i mean i go up twice a week to see my grandmother and i know the staff very well|user:the the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it's a really trying job|user:so	so they couldn't they can't hide anything on you or anything like that	0
user:you know my neighbors across the street their uh mother was sick at times and they they couldn't handle her so they put her in a home|agent:his second wife as that hussy [laughter]|user:yep	and then uh the old Frenchman he'd get a little drunk look round at his kids oh you still need your mother i guess i'll look after her an[d]- and that what happens a lot when when people are	0
user:i don't really um|user:i have to put my foot down where where my life begins i mean if that was my mother i would really f[eel]- i feel a lot more responsible i would probably take care of my mother|user:they still don't want to go to these homes and my grandmother's real there i mean she cries every day this has been over a year and she tries to make me feel really guilty but i have to you know	when my father when something if anything happens to him	1
agent:[laughter]|user:the tow trucks got better there easier and he went out and bought himself a flat bed one so he won't have to do very much work an[d]-|user:and as the years got on	so someone like that they i really don't want to see them go in a home he's got two li[ttle]- dogs that are his constant companions and he always replaces them	0
user:if i brought all my|user:and i'm thinking when i get older i i i think|user:when you get on in your years it's the only thing you really have	precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home	0
agent:yeah|agent:uh-huh|user:quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat just they don't feed them the old people food the chicken and biscuits and things like that that's	that's the thing my grandmother really misses i mean really	0
agent:in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they're too easily swayed by their emotion|agent:or what but uh sometimes i think the jury is ignorant|agent:and i don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or	yeah i think that's true	1
agent:in jail|agent:rather let uh some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in|agent:yeah uh it it it's kind of difficult and i guess the whole system is set up to	right	1
agent:uh-huh i did i did also|user:i thought that they all had to [laughter-agree] or else they it was a hung jury|user:i know they can poll a jury make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was but	and	0
agent:uh in as international law also|agent:but i think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of you know [vocalized-noise] people from different countries|agent:so	yeah i think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street	0
agent:because uh inside the jail there i don't think there's no real rehabilitation it just|agent:no|user:yeah i don't believe that [laughter-very] [laughter-often] [laughter-happens]	i don't think so either In fact i think they end up worse because the conditions are so bad	1
agent:well good|agent:those kinds of things|user:yeah	well i think that covers it	0
agent:of course|user:uh-huh|agent:have pets dogs	well	0
user:and uh ultimately my family moved back to Dallas and i had to stay on in the Philippines ten months after they went back|user:and we took him home with us when he was uh about three weeks old|user:and the uh a Filipino lady that ran the store was giving them away	and uh eventually i shipped him home by air	0
agent:but i had dogs primarily and uh|user:um-hum|agent:uh an old you know alley cat an old Tom	um-hum	1
agent:i was raised in southern West Virginia|user:um-hum|agent:and uh stayed outside	oh okay	1
user:and we went down and picked us up a little old female mongrel|agent:[laughter]|user:so what happened uh was anybody that had a dog at least the native Malays made up fifty percent of the population if you had a dog uh you wouldn't get ripped off by a Malay now the other fifty percent was pa[rt]- some Chinese some Indians and they might then they didn't have any qu[alms]- any qualms about dogs so we went down to the local SPCA uh the American association in in Gautolompora uh actually had uh uh an SPCA there	and uh and brought her home and she made an excellent pet	0
agent:pets|agent:it was uh but the people around here they're you know as i mention them the uh the neighbors a lot of the neighbors have uh|user:oh for goodness sake	um-hum	1
agent:[laughter]|user:no i- i think i- i- i think he he likes our food best uh somehow or another our cat has become a housecat|agent:well he might be canvassing the neighborhood you just might be the last stop on his uh on his route during the day [laughter]	and he uh he sleeps with us he sleeps with my wife and i and either he sleeps across the foot of the bed on top of either my feet or her feet or above the covers	1

agent:well it's it's it's business and they're making money off that|user:and|user:the interesting thing about that is is that uh that that they're encouraging you to incur more incur more debt	and they make more money if you extend your loan	1
agent:i mean a mortgage i know you can|user:yeah it's on uh yeah|agent:i didn't think you could anything on a loan or	yeah on the uh there's there's there's a place for consumer debt and then you take ten percent of it on the	1

agent:well they might tell you it's random|agent:yeah|user:i don't know that you do if it's random then it's random and that's not necessarily fair	um-hum	1
agent:uh-huh|user:it's an accusation and and it's|agent:a uh	and it's b[ased]- based on on uh perception that someone has of how a drug user would behave when some drugs users behave	1

user:just aren't blessed with as as much|user:you know just people that maybe|agent:oh yeah it's just	sharpness and men[tal]- mental acuity	1
agent:you know that's fine and the rest of the world i mean|user:i don't know|agent:[laughter] and it it just doesn't yeah it doesn't make that much difference in the average life in the scientific community and places where it's needed	yeah	1
agent:[noise]	[noise]	1
user:my husband was in the type of business that|agent:yeah|user:but as long as i was single and had to work i was going to get a good job and do the best i could and	you know it's insurance so you have to build a clientele and by the time we had kids i couldn't quit	0
agent:and she was a new teacher at the school and she had eleven you know three year olds in a room and i just think it was way too much they were almost all boys|user:huh|agent:it really gets down to the particular teacher	and she had no help	1
agent:that was a big factor for me that they would would be safe|user:right|user:right	yes	1
agent:oh gosh|user:that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of Monday morning|user:yeah and then in the end um she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me so i was i had a pretty bad taste in my mouth she told me about five thirty one afternoon it was a Friday	well you know i work eight to five thirty so what am i supposed to [laughter-do]	0
agent:yeah|user:yeah basic|user:yeah	so um i talked to another l[ady]- lady at church it was like Thursday of that week and she said oh i found the most wonderful place that i've been taking my daughter and i've know this girl i went to college with her so i really i you i- i value her opinion	0

agent:insurance|agent:yeah and you tack on the insurance they can add to it because|agent:yeah i'm sure they're	if you ever roll one that's pretty much it	0
user:okay [noise]|agent:all right i got a meeting to get to so|user:think we about done our five minutes	good talking to you	0
user:they're not equitable within the state so they're changing that they're talking about changing the uh|user:as a matter of fact they're talking about changing the the tax situation in Texas because the the schools are not|user:uh	the tax base and how the taxes are distributed to the schools	0
agent:then of course the price goes you know the value of the house is going to fall and the existing family homes were the ones that were falling the new homes they were building cheaper and and able to sell cheaper and so people weren't buying the existing family homes so|agent:and same time they were approving new starts in homes hand over fist well when you start having a large supply of homes|user:um-hum	right	1
agent:that is correct|user:then uh all of your state income tax is deductible for federal income tax purposes|user:okay	okay did you live in Texas after the uh	0
agent:and so you they're paying more income tax to pay for your children to go to school it just you know doesn't make sense|agent:you know you've got five children in school instead of somebody that only has one or none|agent:you know your children are going	yeah that's	0
agent:[laughter-i] [laughter-mean]|user:[laughter]|user:right	yeah that's i guess uh one thought that occurred to me uh	0
user:because uh that's i think that's where our real you know the real problem with government is not|agent:yes|user:do something to eliminate what uh what they refer to as transfer payments	is not what the not what the government's doing but where it's spending its money it's it's encouraging people to	1
agent:in his address uh to the nation at the beginning of the year|agent:putting more emphasis on local handling of the problem i think this is something that that Bush came out and said in his uh|agent:yeah that and i think uh	right	1
user:uh seem to think that that's the way to go you know that|user:the American leaders|user:and i just i don't understand why	uh there are not i don't think that there are that many people that feel that way that with what they could get support for	1
user:May [vocalized-noise]|agent:yeah that's when my nephew's birthday is and he goes well you should have it on the fifteenth so we'll see [laughter] [laughter]|agent:oh really	[noise]	1

agent:so i|user:uh-huh|agent:my husband more because he doesn't do [laughter-certain] things that my dad did	the reason i'm asking is because i have a dear dear friend whose father was alcoholic	0
agent:take over the things that my dad fell short in|agent:my mother was also a domineering type of personality because she had to|agent:because i don't want to	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:and mine is pretty stable or much more stable i think probably than any of them but now i waited until i was thirty to get married and they all married at eighteen|user:[noise]	uh-huh uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:the one who initiated having children so certainly he wanted them|user:uh [vocalized-noise] you know alcoholism wasn't a problem resentment whatever was was not a problem at all because each one of our children was planned and he seemed to be	he just didn't have the energy to deal with them and of course now	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:um|user:so he but then he came from a background where he is so much more open with his children than his father was with him	his father was just a very quiet withdrawn person and i assume very shy as is my husband	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and they're on their second marriage and they've got his kids and her kids and i think my gosh all the pain they've caused themselves and their children i just|agent:uh-huh	you know of course everything wasn't always rosy for us but you kn[ow]- we stayed together and	0
agent:uh-huh|user:first of all we have a source now we got a a friend whose a nun|agent:uh-huh	and we've been purchasing her cars she buys a brand new car every three or four years	1

user:uh|user:i figure instead of doing that i'll just i'll just order wood but|agent:[laughter]	[noise]	0
agent:i mean you you just can't sell a car down here that does not have air conditioning in it|agent:but uh the the wea[ther]- the weather's just been really nice but|agent:because it	yeah	1

agent:[laughter] i see yeah [laughter]|user:uh cars are too expensive right now to uh|agent:uh-huh	to even think about buying new cars every couple of years you know it's	1
user:um and then you saw uh hundred thousand dollar cars you saw eighty thousand dollar cars and|agent:um-hum|user:then you started looking at the uh uh they had Ferrari there they had uh BMW and and all these other kind of cars and and Ferrari didn't even let you near the car i mean they were that's how expensive they were	you know even even though i i i do enjoy cars i enjoy um driving them i enjoy uh riding in them and everything but	0
agent:take care|user:you too|agent:well you have a pleasant evening	uh-huh bye-bye	1
user:and in the United States and that is all of the tool and die equipment in this country that has been here|user:the it certainly it's so much easier to do your do computations calculations to measure things with it to in every every aspect of it is simpler except there is one big stumbling block in it|user:and uh	for the last hundred years is in the English system	0
agent:from here to somewhere she wants to go and i'll say oh about eight kilometers|agent:a and it drives my wife crazy you know she'll say how far is it|agent:uh in in terms of the numbers that you've got to carry around i guess one of the things i i think metrically i've got a uh	uh-huh	1
user:four years from when i was seven to eleven years old and|user:right i uh lived in Brazil for|user:right	so by the time i got into high school and took some physics there and then into college um where i was a physics major in college so i'm	0
user:to to get to a point where it it's something other than something that causes them fear and confusion|user:don't have the opportunity to to really use it|user:it's too bad that more Americans can't	because if you just	1
user:okay|user:it|agent:and and chemists that's what i got my first degree in chemistry too and i and i and you know we don't talk in quarts and pints we talk in liters and milliliters	no	1
user:um|user:basic research all the way through uh we have a couple of systems that are actually|user:uh the kind of things i do is manage uh research and development contracts and we do everything from	places where they're producing a product	0
user:a product|user:the people however that have the engineers that are actually producing|user:in turn around	do most of their	0
agent:right uh you you mentioned just a side light here you mentioned you lived in Brazil whereabouts|user:but|user:it kind of seems strange	and Sao Paulo	1
agent:yeah you like Colorado are are you a civilian employee about now or or military|user:uh i'm one of those [laughter]|agent:oh okay okay	[noise] yeah	1
agent:but but interestingly enough we think it makes sense to to think metrically with our money you know ten cents makes a dime ten dimes makes a dollar uh which is basically thinking metrically|agent:but|user:oh [vocalized-noise] that's it [vocalized-noise] you got to	oh yeah	0
user:yeah i thought|agent:you are|user:oh me i'm in favor of it	i think if uh	1
user:i'm for[get]- i|agent:right|user:um retrials and um	cannot think of that word	1
agent:well yeah but you know there there are so many people who just get get their jollies off of watching that|user:well it might scare some people off of doing the crimes|agent:i thought that was disgusting i mean	you know	1
agent:right|user:uh show them what would happen|user:but i i i don't know i think i would [noise] say that if they put it where those first time offenders of uh your sex crimes and murderers	now my aunt had a uh	0
agent:i can't i can't think eith[er]-|user:can't think of his name|agent:yeah	but he spent quite a f[ew]- few	0
agent:and uh it it it just doesn't seem right that our tax money or somebody's tax money goes to keep him alive|user:that's a man that should be put to death|user:and uh	yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:yeah that's what my husband keeps telling me see how you know um i'm just now getting into the world politics and all that|agent:we['ve]- for the first time we're sort of aligned with a lot of these Arab countries	uh i guess i just too young to understand this or something	0
user:oh no|agent:[noise] and we didn't have a tent or any camping supplies so we'd sleep on those picnic tables at roadside parks i mean i know it's dangerous i wouldn't do it now but we did|user:um-hum	[laughter]	1
user:uh-huh|agent:i think the longest we've stayed out there is like five days and they even they had a library at one time out there|user:yeah do you go on long like a week at a time or just weekends	oh	1
user:oh really|agent:well my husband has even camped at Lake Lavon with one of his friends he just decided to take the kids out there|user:that time of year we had taken our electric blanket too just in case it was unbearable but we didn't need it	yeah	1
agent:yeah those double ones|user:yeah those are nice we have one of those too|agent:and everybody's got their sleeping bags we got air mattresses we decided that was easier than cots and more comfortable	uh-huh	1
agent:i don't like it when there's mosquitoes so bad|user:it's fun|agent:yeah	oh me either	1
agent:oh yeah yeah|user:uh no it's a little trailer you pull behind your car and uh|agent:you mean that you put on a truck or what	you know you the lid pops off the little tent comes up the top and it had two double beds in it	1
user:i don't know|agent:the computers|agent:i wonder if these are going to be speaking	i type up the tapes of what people talked about	1
user:[noise] [laughter]|agent:[noise] of course it's not but not in a tent|user:oh	uh-huh	1
user:and my wi[fe]- my wife's mother is uh|user:do you have anybody that you uh h[ave]- are close to that decision on or anything or i've thought about it for myself and all|agent:yes we are	in a retirement home she's not in a nursing home	0
agent:oh|user:like uh a guard with locks we've been there once at night at Christmas she just went in last year|user:oh yeah they they they have uh	she drives and everything she she's perfectly healthy	0
agent:that just bothered me so much especially you know at my age i was probably about fourteen|user:oh that would be awful i never thought about that you know|agent:that just bothered me	um-hum	1
agent:of course i've seen those reports on TV the horrible ones and that scares me|agent:um|agent:i think they're really neat	oh yeah	0
agent:oh you're not going to put me away [laughter] that's what my mother she always you're going to lock me up one day aren't you i can t[ell]- i can tell you're going to lock me up|agent:[laughter]|user:i'm going to build a little house behind yours and then and i'll take care of your lawn he says but i'm not going to one of those places	right yeah	1
agent:[laughter] well luckily he drives a big old tank [laughter]|agent:[laughter]|agent:[laughter]	yeah	1
user:driving it would it would sure|agent:right|user:after sixty five every five years have a refresher course and then take another	the insurance companies would would probably help pay for some of that you know	1
user:uh that helps the rationale any but it's still angering to see the abuses uh even though they're uh|agent:right|user:still a feeling of you know it's not totally wasted dollars if you think about it some of it coming back your way	a relatively small percentage they still they sound humongous when they're you know you hear millions and sometimes billions of dollars spent and	0
agent:well that's good|user:we're in a particular part of the state that's pretty well off so it's it's like we get a lot of that back as far as local taxation goes|user:but	yeah we have a real good you know police department and real good uh city services and boy the parks are all over the place and there's a lot of	0
user:more money just trying to administer some of these programs than the programs are worth uh it seems uh|user:the uh bureaucracy seems to spend|user:yeah yeah	an awful waste of time to have so many people having to fill out so much paper just to get rid of so few dollars in some of these cases	0
user:it does seem to be the case|user:right|agent:they'll either find it themselves or they'll find someone to do it for them	i don't know whether it's	0
agent:right|user:you know a tax your income because now you're talking about having to report it and all that kind of stuff|user:uh therefore you should be taxed this much uh that would only encourage saving it's not a	but if you put the burden on	0
agent:no|user:that's true plus what what there will be of it even if it's there isn't quite enough anyway [laughter-so]|user:right	you're looking at having to do it on your own for the most part and then hope what you did didn't go away	1
user:[laughter]|agent:so uh what do you think about our involvement in the Middle East|user:[noise]	well actually i think it's good i i i hope that we uh uh get a chance to uh promote peace out there	0
agent:bad shape [noise]|agent:so i don't i don't know how to i don't i don't know what to do about it but um [noise] but i think that that you know in general the region is really in|user:oh yeah [laughter]	do you think the US is going to wind up keeping uh military bases over there	1
agent:out of the home life [laughter]|agent:and um i have some friends in Israel and we we talk a bit about it but we try and keep it out of|agent:she has sort of friends and family in Saudi Arabia ac[tually]- well friends in Saudi Arabia	do you uh d[oes]- does she ever want to go back to Syria	1
agent:if that if if that amounts for anything|user:[laughter]|agent:if that if so	[laughter] okay well who you know do you have uh a lot of Kosher foods there at your house	1
agent:ought to buy the bread from [laughter] that's great well you've you've you've really got a handle on this stuff i've noticed you|user:bread the kids would sell me [laughter]|user:and i was the only Goyim at at all the you know Seder dinners and everything and i used to have to go with rolls of not pocketful of change to buy all this	[laughter] not not	1
user:um i- i- i guess i guess i can intellectually uh kind of come to grips with all of that but you know emotionally i have a real difficult time|user:well that's uh to me it's it's really|agent:um it's amazing to think that people in the Middle East sort of all hate each other	believing that uh that that people that believe in God and and love not war and to forgive	1
agent:have you ever seen this|agent:there's something about there's a poem somewhere i don't know if you've ever seen it or not um um Everything I Ever Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten|agent:and and i i don't know there's a	yeah	1
agent:yeah that's a good station i listen to it every once in a while too|user:[laughter]|agent:uh [laughter] well probably around the corner [laughter] um	uh-huh do you play any instruments	1
agent:yeah i went to i went to uh Rice and we had the marching owl band|user:which was fun|agent:oh really	it uh	1
agent:um Elton John is more seventies|user:um|user:is that right	uh yeah certainly but uh	1
user:i ended up winning about uh two hundred and thirty radio contests in two school years|agent:[laughter] that's great|user:i had forty record albums before i even had a stereo to play them [vocalized-noise] to play them on	so i accumulated my record collection mostly from that	1
agent:you're kidding me|user:they sent me uh a small flag in the mail that whi[ch]- which had postage due [laughter]|agent:um	[laughter]	0
agent:yeah i use my scan button a lot|agent:yeah|user:i enjoy listening to those old tunes they don't play a lot of that stuff on the radio any more you have to pick the right station	uh-huh	1
agent:[laughter] is there still that type of music available|user:course the head bangers i stay away from those entirely|agent:yeah	certainly is just turn on MTV any night	1
agent:uh-huh|user:they used to be almost a country band|user:different very creative th[ey]- they really uh made uh quite a transition	uh playing such	1
agent:oh probably Amy Grant is the biggest one yeah she's even she's got a song right now that playing on a|agent:well i don't know|user:well who's uh who's who's popular now with the uh contemporary Christian music	i don't listen too much	0
agent:yeah i hope that it does for her she deserves it she's a nice person [laughter] so|agent:well|user:sometimes it works out	uh-huh	1
agent:hello	hi	0
agent:probably not no|user:yeah that's interesting i don't i- i suspect they're not our biggest threat anymore|agent:uh given the the uh military powers on both sides i think it's always a threat	i suspect it's probably some crazy man like Saddam Hussein	0
user:yeah oh i agree i mean if we were to|agent:but i- i agree right now they're not i don't believe they're a large threat right now i think there's always some threat|user:yeah uh	if if something were to happen i'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of	1
user:making those people angry at him and he's also i think he's also making|user:because he's|agent:yeah	um the military angry at him	0
agent:yeah|user:yeah that that's real scary actually i mean i- i would suspect their own problems would keep them away from us for awhile but|agent:yeah	it could be real dangerous	1
user:that's true i was i was discussing with someone before um this uh|agent:wipe him out|agent:this guy prays differently and to someone else than i do so therefore he's wrong and he's bad and we have to wipe	someone before actually one of these calls	0
user:and we learned to um play with each other|user:and in kindergarten we learned to share|user:the idea that um basically they said you know everything happened in kindergarten and	we learned to take nap you know and to take naps and and whenever we'd start a fight we'd all apologize and hug each other	0
agent:there's nothing that they can do|agent:they can't change it they try and they|agent:[vocalized-noise] th[ey]- i mean they they can't do any	yeah that's	0
user:and then just sort of told well you're here now you're part of our country and|agent:yeah|user:taken over couple of you know not too long ago	you be this way	1
agent:yeah|user:they were sort of forced and now they just want to sort of speak up and say hey we want our piece|user:um um [vocalized-noise] actually it sounds very i mean very similar they're sort of being	and they have other problems they have Shiite Muslims to deal with	0
user:i mean we did it|agent:yeah|agent:yeah	couple of hundred years ago here but	0
agent:co[mpared]- compared to what|user:okay i think the crime in Dallas is horrendous|agent:[noise]	[noise] compared now to when i f[irst]- came here twenty years ago	0
agent:electric clocks home and you wonder what that does to the fighting crime i[f]- if they had an electric clock on their desk they were supposed to take it home to save energy|agent:before you called it uh and they cut[back]- and they cutback on overtime and they have to take|agent:it just on the news i was just watching a little of it just	are you serious	0
user:[noise]|agent:yeah|agent:uh	and they broke in at night and uh	0
user:that's real scary|agent:oh that's scary because_1 everybody feels you're supposed to have dead bolts|user:just something they kicked my door in they literall[y]- i had a solid wooden door with a dead bolt on it and they backed up and put their foot to it and kicked it in molding and all	i have a and i	0
user:and if they if you're here and they try breaking in shoot them_1|user:i really do[n't]- and you know the police told me to get a gun|user:i really don't know	now i have never heard policemen telling people to get a gun and shoot people before	0
agent:yeah|user:and then the thing is keeping them_1 locked up|agent:the problem is is is what do you lock them_1 up for you know	you know they pick them_1 up they lock them_1 up and then they they let them_1 go	1
agent:i don't know two or three hundred dollars or something i mean your silver probably is worth a lot but uh what are they going to do walk down the street and tell everybody what would you like to buy uh a [vocalized-noise]|user:yeah yeah|agent:you know a place setting is is	[noise]	1

user:uh know quite a bit about uh raising parakeets|user:well there is a a neighbor of mine used to uh|agent:have did did you know that there was a difference in the parakeets	and she had uh a lot of connections when it came to getting good birds	1
agent:you might check uh some of the ads in the paper and see if anybody has an aviary that you might be able to buy from there|user:and they don't seem to be as healthy as uh one's you get from uh breeders|user:uh but uh more recent years they moved away and i've been buying parakeets at the local pet shop	yeah	1
agent:yeah but we've used it we just have two rabbits right now we have one doe and one buck|agent:yeah that's the problem with buying them through the pet shops we have that same problem here too|user:and we looked at them and decided they weren't uh too healthy looking	uh-huh	1
user:i uh we we had a tough time deciding on a name so i named him uh Mister Tibbar|user:uh|user:last summer and we gave him away because the girls lost interest in him and couple of them we're getting allergic to rabbits	and they wanted to know how i figured out that name and i said well it's rabbit spelled backwards	1
user:i lived on a farm when i was growing up and when we bought the farm there was uh|user:well we had uh|user:yeah	couple of farm cats on the property	1
agent:okay thank you|user:all right|agent:on this little test that they're trying to do	bye	1

agent:right|user:and uh he ate his dinner and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted|agent:yes	so now the young fathers are having a chance to parent	0
agent:very much pro-women pro-career which is kind of interesting he comes from a culture where women are stay at home and do everything|agent:um he's ten years older than me and but he has his attitudes are|user:sure	uh-huh	1
agent:i kind of keep up with all the finances you know paying the bills and typically i do most of the [laughter-spending] too as well so|agent:no we don't really do anything formal um|user:do you uh could you tell me if you uh budget your monthly expenses	[laughter]	1
user:and our savings weren't|agent:um-hum|user:so we had to watch what we were doing	that great	0
user:they take out for CODA and then uh um|agent:right|user:for retirement you know	the IRA's	1
agent:yeah that's that's the way we work it|user:right yeah|user:yes	it it	1
user:um|agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh	but this other it's in the credit union and they and they take it out and it goes in there and at the end of the month but if we want to go on a trip or if something looks good or if we want to go away for a weekend	1
agent:yeah no i never g[o]- like to go into those things that are|user:you know well you can't cash in a CD that's kind of ridiculous|user:long term or or	um	0
user:um|agent:yeah|agent:i don't know	my wife used to they matched hers only hers was a little bit better than ours um she hasn't been working for a	0
agent:uh-huh|user:we heated with oil [noise]|user:the oil	we they put us on a budget they would run like uh [vocalized-noise] they could really tell how much oil you were going to use	0
user:yeah i talked to to uh|agent:well it is to a certain extent to have to try to keep up with all that|user:it it became a chore	[noise]	0
user:i didn't run it like|user:course me|user:but even at that point you know she'd say oh you know we we need this or the budget's not doing this or that uh	she ran it like you run it now	1

agent:i think it would be a good thing though to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing|user:sure would|agent:yeah so	um-hum	1
user:that's right|agent:but you know if [vocalized-noise] a lot of people flat can't afford to you know that and most kids these days have gotten themselves into|user:i'm not either really	that's right	1
user:yep|agent:i- i think it can't be something that's mandatory it has to be something that's voluntary|user:um-hum	yep	1
agent:although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their [laughter-parents] [laughter]|user:that's right|agent:yeah that's true [laughter] most of them_1 probably wouldn't do something like that	yeah that's that's true too that's true too bu[t]-	1
agent:i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them_1 you know it'd be it it wouldn't take up much much it would take up more time than anything but it wouldn't take up a lot of money they wouldn't have to spend money advertising and things like that|agent:yeah|user:say let's do this you know	yeah	1
agent:[noise]|user:and i guess even back to Kennedy as a matter of f[act]- i guess Kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing or|agent:yeah	was it you know really interested in things like that	1

agent:um-hum|user:anyway|agent:um-hum	and of course they don't have the money to make an investment like that	0
agent:of course i don't understand why they don't if they're going to kill them_1 they might as well eat the turtles too and|user:probably are probably are|agent:oh yeah they they probably are i	well they may do it	1

user:[noise] and the i don't remember the name of the place but for a menu all they had was a|agent:oh|user:that was really unique the waitresses were dressed with like little cowgirls	it was like a wooden block	0
agent:yes and|user:oh that's too bad see how one|agent:and then when she finally did bring something um to replace that she practically threw it at the person	one place one person can make a big difference on whether you go back to the place again	1
agent:and that really up sets me when i see that [laughter]|user:yeah right|user:[laughter]	[laughter] i- i can certainly understand that	0
user:oh boy|agent:[laughter] i agree with that but just don't ever get a glass that has lipstick on it oh that is terrible i had that happen only once i don't remember where but it's always one time enough for me to be aware of the situation and i look at every glass that i [laughter-get]|user:bringing over to you instead of just grabbing a handful and [laughter-bring] [laughter-them] [laughter-over] [laughter-again] [laughter]	[laughter]	1

user:it would seem to me that if that if i owned a business the thing that i would want to do is|user:uh-huh|agent:but many of the smaller stores grocery stores card shops uh rest[aurants]- smaller restaurants i can't compete with some of the larger ones and they are all going under	is a get little survey uh you know like we're doing with each other and and encourage people to to give that information back to the management	1

agent:not too many of the situation comedies do i care for|agent:but uh|agent:uh	no i don't care for tho[se]-	0
agent:that keeps you up to date|agent:yeah in fact i think you can even uh order a magazine|user:yeah they had a program on the other day about people that were addicted to [laughter-soap] [laughter-operas]	[laughter]	1
agent:because_1 Sunday was really busy|user:oh [laughter]|agent:i told my wife i sure do wish they'd gave us Monday off rather than [laughter-Friday] off	uh-huh you had company	1
user:and medical and dental programs sometimes as well as just the ability to takeoff uh personal leave or whatever you need|user:usually a good vacation time and they offer uh holidays and|user:well a large organization offers uh	and one thing that i've found coming in handy lately is juror duty uh being paid for that or or at least a full days pay plus whatever the	0
agent:well as as you say the the um benefits are the biggest part of it i think that today with costs uh for medical insurance and eyeglasses and dental and all that it is a boo[m]- a a a plus to have that ev[en]- as far as your uh salary goes you know along with it because_1 it's not out of pocket money and it they also have good in[surance]- uh life insurance policies good retirement Dakota the um jet funds all that stuff i think you know the IRA's|user:what have you found that you like in a big organization|user:it's it's nice to have flex time especially being able to take off in the middle of the day and uh not hurt your pay if you come back and finish your eight hours that's that's a real benefit	um-hum	1
user:there's a number of us in our little group that end up having to take the must used five or six of us in fact uh just|user:must use okay|agent:oh i use it up [laughter]	tend not to get around to taking it all at once and uh by the end of the year it kind sneaks up on us and i managed to carry forward the maximum amount there is and and uh i'm still doing uh my wife works uh half of a half of one day	0
agent:so that's quite a feat in itself|user:yeah|agent:to eliminate that and that you're talking about five thousand people	yeah it is	0
user:and uh then they don't have quite the job security although you know now there's a lot of people getting cut but|agent:yeah yeah|user:uh it just did they had to schedule it around when they could get away and it just wasn't as convenient as being able to say well tomorrow i think i will [laughter-you] [laughter-know]	still but by and large the majority of people that are still there	0
agent:and they offer uh a lot of uh opportunity to go to school|user:well have|agent:yeah	um-hum	1
agent:so a lot of the the people can go you know to uh a good school|user:right|agent:you know like MIT and and uh Boston's only uh an hours drive from here	um-hum	1
user:in Alabama where i came from they they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree|user:and they uh|agent:um-hum	so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided nope	0
agent:i was even married that i wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools|agent:but i had decided long before|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:i mean you you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and|agent:um-hum|user:back when i was going to school [noise] uh you just didn't get away with things these kids get away with now	usually bending over to get five of the best	0
agent:um|user:two i'd say two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills|user:easily	and i asked him uh	0
user:he was a uh|user:well i have i i've fully i think i understood what the what the kid was doing|agent:crazy for him to but	well let's just say he was one of those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something	1
user:and when you see uh Koreans and Chinese and Japanese|agent:right|agent:but	who are taking all the uh science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs	1
agent:um-hum|user:and uh i just same sort of thing they just you you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases and then you get one exam for the whole semester|user:um yeah [laughter]	and it's how well you can remember it all	1
agent:no there's plenty of money in the system it's just|user:[laughter] money money is not the answer|agent:goo[d]- good question [laughter] probably taking	yeah i mean th[ey're]- they're throwing more money at it now than ever before and things are getting worse	1
agent:yeah|user:and i think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school|agent:um-hum	you know i mean i[t's]- it's silly that these that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline	1
user:i think i think|user:well|agent:but	i i mean what we've turned the schools into now are just day care centers	0
agent:don't want their children in public schools because the influence and maybe if they was a group of Mennonites or something like that i don't think they're is [laughter-in]|agent:you know they they will allow you to i can't think of any examples [noise] but certain religious groups|user:[laughter]	um-hum	1
user:uh|user:i'm pretty satisfied with them_1|agent:okay	the only thing	1
agent:i don't use it that much either uh of course i'm using it right [laughter-now] i had|user:in a year|agent:we've used it quite a bit in the past when our kids were smaller but uh	[laughter] you	1

user:yeah|user:yeah|agent:command and then their employee number and away it goes	but you have to go in and and individually check everybody	1
agent:payroll hassle and everything|agent:benefit well they uh what they do is uh well i guess it's basically for smaller companies that don't want to have all the|agent:new thing that come along and uh	uh-huh	1
user:the end of the den and we decided we went to i've forgotten one of the paint stores and they just said|user:well we did a uh we moved oh last August and we're getting a house my house had this dark wood paneling at|agent:uh it just didn't look as smooth as i wanted it to	oh you can get by and i forgotten what it was you put down	0

agent:uh-huh|user:and i'm the administrator for our local area network and i need to keep that going and|user:just hasn't used PCs that much so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing	so	1
agent:i'm just totally drawing a blank we just [laughter] but uh the way things have have changed over the years with the PC and the different programs is just great it's remarkable as far as the things that we can do now and compared to what we could do you know|agent:what's the word i'm looking for|agent:really [vocalized-noise] they're	[laughter]	1
agent:oh|user:and we had about ten people sharing this printer|agent:uh-huh	by it was attached to like a central PC and you had to take your diskette to the PC to print something	1
user:yeah i've i've got a little little uh|agent:dot matrix printers|agent:right the quality that you can put out off with one of those as compared to one of those	IBM Pro Printer	0
agent:the color would take too long to pl[ot]- uh to plot out|agent:sometimes|user:huh-uh	yeah	1
agent:uh-huh|user:the uh well it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until N C N B came in and bought up the rival and now N C N B's got a little larger market share|user:that was uh i was amazed when i came to work i worked at	but it's the [vocalized-noise] it's the only	0
user:do these things but i was|user:and it's real hard to pry money out of him to to t[o]-|agent:uh-huh	i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better and	1
agent:were we right in the Middle East|agent:uh|agent:so	sure	1
agent:if we could have freed the country|agent:wouldn't it have been wonderful|agent:i agree	yes [laughter] But i think that's almost impossible next to impossible	1
agent:there was probably three and four hours at sixty five miles an hour|agent:here and west Texas|agent:between	oh i didn't realize that	1
user:i've never been there i've seen pictures i just i'm a college student and um|user:but|agent:Yellowstone	i'm paying for my own education and i'm	0

user:[noise]	well who's the team	1
user:uh|user:oh yeah and see i was i was really thinking that they might have a let down because_1 i i i was in a basketball pot and i picked uh Kansas for i guess more or less an upset but i i was thinking that|user:couldn't hang with them	Duke might have a let down after playing such a tough game with UNLV	0
agent:well what about professionally|agent:yeah|user:because_1 i think if they would play their game i don't know if there's anybody that could that could keep up with them	but	1
user:uh they can't hardly trade him because_1 nobody wants to pay that much for him|user:so whether he plays or not they've got to pay him ten million dollars so if they|user:and the problem with him is he's on a guaranteed salary like for three years	and if they just keep him that hurts their salary cap so that guy's got Dallas in a big old bind	0
user:just all right but he's getting to where uh i don't know if it's his age or what but he just can't play the whole game they've got to get somebody young that can|user:and uh|agent:yeah how's he doing this year	uh run the court that's still big	1
agent:Dantely didn't they get Dantely|user:Alex English and and Rodney McCrae|user:and then they they uh last year went out and got oh Fat Leever and uh	yeah they didn't and i'm not for sure what the deal is on him i think he's been hurt but he hadn't played	0

user:yeah and they d[id]- they made some trades uh|user:they're uh|agent:well they had i don't think it was last year the year before they were doing really good and i think they had an off year last year	oh they had one white guy i can't think of his name that was real good	1
agent:yeah i kind of wa[tch]- you know see what's happening|agent:yeah|user:oh okay so you keep up with the	uh	1
user:but uh|agent:and uh|agent:yeah	and Michigan too	0
agent:so i find it very interesting how about_1 you|user:um-hum|agent:and i uh don't have a lot of opportunity to work on the PC except at home	um i have one uh a Wang or um sorry a Compaq portable that my son picked up at one point	0
user:i have um uh it's not really a budget package but a|agent:um-hum|user:and it's very good for for graphics and actually i- i mean it's to the point where programs are ea[sily]- readily available and inexpensive so i did my income tax on it	a financial tracking package you know for my checkbook and stuff like that	1
agent:[noise] that's right and e[ven]- even using it as much as i do you know and you'd you'd oh well i did that i know i did that you know and then the results come back and no you didn't [laughter] they catch you every time [laughter]|agent:[laughter]|user:and it just doesn't work and and so you tell somebody who knows about computers and they say no you obviously didn't do that because the computer doesn't [noise] doesn't balk [laughter]	[laughter]	1
agent:[noise]|agent:bye-bye|user:you too bye-bye	[noise]	1
user:and uh|agent:yeah|user:but there is you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different uh container	Plano has plans i believe it's tentatively scheduled for sometime in May of this year the city is going to leave uh receptacles at people's home	1
agent:plastic um and put it in front of the Wal-Mart store in town and th[ey]- they it just really e[very]- e[very]- every time you went by there it was just over flowing and so Wal-Mart [laughter-complained] so they moved it behind the store and nobody knew where it was and so people kept piling stuff in the same place where it used to be|user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:you know at your home where you could just turn it in so they they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area|user:sure|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:absolutely|user:absolutely|agent:yeah i do to because it's amazing how much you know trash we can generate i know this year we took our Christmas tree they had a place in the park where you could go have your tree shredded and they gave you a little	right	1
user:uh-huh|agent:the the diaper service trucks apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver and drop those [laughter-off]|agent:you know all different kinds of things too so	yeah	1

agent:uh-huh|user:to a rationalized system and and used to making all the necessary conversions|user:and uh so i became quite accustomed to uh	and since then i have discovered uh other engineers	0
user:uh and little things like that i i notice in a lot of uh|agent:very good idea yeah yeah|agent:they'll	uh technical literature that you pick up and catalogs and so forth that you will find	0
agent:like i said i was just totally amazed at how at how very easy it was you know i i just couldn't|agent:well i think eventually it will happen you know it's just going to take it's just going to take a lot of education and a lot of time and|agent:so	uh-huh	1
user:and the the basic units of measure are are distance and time and mass|agent:uh-huh|user:they should come out right	and electric charge	0
agent:is there really huh|user:kilometers per hour and miles per hour|user:electronic panels there's a little push button some place on the panel that you can switch between uh	my wife's uh Chrysler convertible has little buttons that you can choose what display you want to see	1

user:and going to school|agent:exactly|user:students now on campus uh i guess most of them drink or have binges on weekends and	is also always very prohibitive now unless your parents are wealthy	0
agent:right|user:and it was it's like one huge city when i was flying in|agent:i see	it was just all lights	1
user:rather than just kids out there for a good time|user:i'm not sure how much of that is is crime|user:um	yeah	1
agent:uh|agent:as far as the officers and things like that but|user:yeah	they're being overwhelmed i think anyhow i mean	1
user:yeah|agent:i just don't understand that|agent:you know with the chance of even getting paroled and uh you know that's just	um	1
user:it was|agent:right|user:yeah he can [noise] because it's eventually it's going to it's going to swing back	they had the death penalty way back and then it swung the other way and everybody's swore	1
agent:um i was gainfully employed by Safeway Stores Incorporated|user:uh-huh uh-huh|agent:and uh a great disappointment for some people like myself	uh-huh	1
agent:um i think so i- i i i|user:well represented uh demographically at the higher echelons|user:and is the company now uh	did it work	1
user:so there's less you think now there's less of a a|agent:um|user:uh-huh uh-huh	social movement and more individual m[ovements]- lots of individual movements [noise] in a sense	1
user:no longer being sort of on top [vocalized-noise] i had the impression|user:pessimism with America|user:a certain increase um	[noise]	0
user:and all the changes that have happened in the last uh even during my adulthood|user:and i|user:uh you saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and um major social change in that sense	have been more incremental	0
user:so i see i see a lot of uh|user:and in the sense that how could America have gone from being number one to possibly being number two to you know our former enemies and things like that and um|user:and losing it in the competitive market and a real knowl[edge]- uh a lack of understanding how that could be	a lot of pessimism growing	0
agent:goals of civil rights|agent:uh along the line of the uh|user:[noise]	uh-huh	1

agent:yeah|user:hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay work for low social prestige just because they care about good education|user:and if you have that kind of social attitude it's	and you get more and more people who would just end up there because it's uh	0
agent:you know some instances i don't you always have the option now in criminal i guess you always have a jury but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not|agent:yeah|user:should handle cases like that	oh is that right	1
agent:oh|user:that uh even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it they settled the case|user:and it finally ended up	they wou[ld]- they had settled while we were deliberating	1
user:sure|agent:and that you're very much right but the jury may or may not see it that way so you get a little antic[ipate]- you know anxious there and go well you know|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:um and we protect him so much but what about the rest of the society you know what are we doing for them we're kind of you know forgetting about them and i think sometimes that a criminal should kind of if he breaks law especially it he's a repeater the law shouldn't just always cover for him that some of his rights as should be taken [laughter]|user:uh-huh|agent:especially in criminals that that their rights are so protected but what about the rights of you know the rest of society i mean we're protecting this person's rights who has broken the law	well and then in a lot of	0

agent:uh-huh|user:in the Dallas area and big market for|user:the area that people are moving into	for yards yard work	1
agent:and the time that it took especially when you start mowing and then when it comes to fertilize then it would come to raking and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water|user:uh-huh|agent:and uh we had no idea the expense that lawns and gardening [laughter] would run into	uh-huh	1

agent:oh|user:you know there are some oaks magnolias and like plum trees peach trees|agent:oh that's even better	there are some big	1
user:and well bad thing is i mean you can't do that because the the Saudis asked you know the Saudis were were helping you know out|agent:if they you know if they|agent:you know	on only under the condition that	0
agent:more of a permanent type of basis which will be a first|user:uh-huh|agent:anyway but now it looks like uh you know Kuwait has asked us to defend its borders	yeah	1
user:you know is a God is i[s]- is someone that's going to relieve them of all their troubles and how can you get across to people that|user:then again you got you have all the Palestinians that that think that this Saddam Hussein is is a|user:but	think that you know their savior you're telling them_1 that their savior	1
agent:yeah|user:in the situation make sure that|user:i don't know how to say i[t]- how to say it exactly in words but you know just kind of stay with one eye looking	United States can go in	0
agent:i don't know maybe they were helicopters i thought they were airpl[anes]- i thought they were letting the helicopters fly around a[nd]- a[nd]-|user:the uh helicopter gun ships that that they shot down|agent:so	because uh what i heard was that	1
user:and then|user:and then you know and then and especially with the Middle East the way it is they the too -[in]sane you know these these the Arabs are fighting amongst themselves|agent:yep	one Arab decides to ask	0
agent:you know what effect it has in the long run y[ou]- you know to be all right|agent:whether that uh|agent:and uh	well i think it deterred i think it deterred Hussein from doing anything else because if w[e]- if for example we we let Hussein go in there and take Kuwait then	1

user:[laughter]|agent:oh editorial cartoons about all the retired generals making their living [laughter-during] the the Gulf War|agent:i i don't know the value of that because um i saw plenty of jokes and and um	i've been getting a kick out of those lately	1
agent:it it it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind you know there were some that were screaming for air power there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it|agent:um|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:i thought that was a really unusual thing|agent:to to help parents uh learn how to talk about their war with their children|user:um-hum	and our local HEB stores here i don't know if it's HEB statewide or whatever but they have videos	0
agent:and probably more importantly one that lasted short enough that that people's interest didn't {flauge} too badly|user:covered by the news|user:so i don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly	yeah	0
user:because i was watching CNN|agent:um-hum|user:sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open	and they would they would switch back to the one of their Israel bureaus	0

agent:yeah|user:the little one still he just wants to poke my older one our older son's pretty good about it he'll pet the dog you [laughter-know]|user:so they go the first thing they do is they go out there and play with them but boy	and and he's three and a half like you're saying and he he's pretty good with them and with other people's dogs and cats that he runs into	1
user:the the eighteen month old it's not fair to the animal|user:i think when they're really little like|agent:yeah	because_1 the kids are so miserable to them [laughter]	0
agent:oh wonderful [laughter] i'm just flat out of pet stories i don't even have a pet anymore|user:well i think that's about all my pet stories right now so|agent:we uh	[laughter]	1

user:oh|agent:i can't find one that i've done it it's one of those things i didn't i didn't give them away but i didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:me too|user:i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows|user:i guess i've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past but i've kind of gotten out of that	really [laughter]	0
agent:and and they're all a handful so it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly|user:um|agent:she has three kids all under the age of like six	oh definitely yeah [laughter]	1

user:uh well|agent:hm|user:uh-huh	i shouldn't it's counted cross stitch actually	0
user:and there's there's so many other things that i|user:uh-huh|agent:just hard finding the time that can be dedicated to that	i have done you know in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts i've made a lot of bibs	0
user:especially letters|user:and it it depends on what it is you know but some things|agent:um	if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to yeah i	0
agent:with ink or|agent:what|user:you know	uh-huh	0
agent:i was amazed|user:[laughter]|agent:um in fact i had a bunch of people come to look at it and they were fighting over how much they were going to pay me for this piece of junk	i think any car that runs right now is in demand	1
agent:yeah|user:and i had a turn signal out so i had to take it in to get the turn signal fixed but uh other than that|user:i had past uh state inspection uh just last month so	for passing inspection	0
agent:so it's just one of those weird things i mean he was will[ing]- he said well i think it's in the ignition switch it'll only cost you eighty five dollars but i won't guarantee that's the problem|user:yeah|agent:but now it's starting to recur again	right they never do	1
agent:yeah|user:i'm ready for a new car myself but i've had this car for eleven years and it's given me such little trouble that i i i don't think i could|user:yep	get an adequate replacement	0
agent:i don't think that's worth it [laughter] i don't think spending an extra you know twenty thousand dollars for a car is worth it you know|user:right|agent:and the guy was oh yeah he's almost proud that he had to pay an extra ten bucks to get his oil changed i'm going	[laughter]	1
agent:i think this uh the the Dodge would be pretty easy to change the oil on i think|agent:yeah|agent:yeah i just couldn't yeah	yeah	1

user:yeah|user:um-hum|agent:yeah i'd seen the cat around here before i thought it belonged to somebody but i have no idea what killed it	good grief may have been poisoned or something	1
agent:because_1 he was uh he was in fairly good shape but apparently just didn't have a home or couldn't find his way home and i don't believe it because he was one smart dog|user:um-hum|agent:the last dog i got i think was that way	um-hum	1

agent:yeah|user:but i want to get one of those um padded ankle|agent:yeah	what you call its	1
agent:yeah|user:i- i wonder though it's i think it really depends on the person|user:well you know i-	i was reading an article in the paper the other morning these doctors are baffled about this eighty seven year old man	0
agent:yeah|user:yeah good and low|agent:hundred and ten over seventy or something like that	and uh	0
user:like in other places where they have a you know like mandatory you know|user:to to that you know to your job if it's voluntary i mean if you don't like it i mean if you're|agent:right	uh services	0
agent:i definitely agree with you i would hate to to see that become mandatory|agent:uh so that the public is a little more aware of it but uh|user:yeah	well there i don't think there's any way it can you know like they say this proposal would any[where]-	0
agent:i see|user:everybody that is unlucky enough has to do the military service|user:and uh everybody	and but you go into this whole big lottery	0
user:everybody that's your same age is l[istening]- listening to the radio|agent:right|user:yeah i i didn't have to do it but the thing was that you have you know the whole the whole nation's watching you know like i[f]- if it's your class	waiting for them to announce the number you know	0
user:and so i mean but you know it's like|agent:i see|user:right	the thing is is that you know you just get treated i mean o[ne]- one of the guys that was doing it	0
user:you know it's like|agent:[laughter] right|agent:[laughter]	and then the other thing is when i get out of college at twenty eight with my [laughter-BS] you know it's like by the time	1
agent:well i left TI in January but i signed up for this before i did|user:are are you at TI Austin or|agent:okay	oh that's great no uh uh	0
user:i've been with TI i'm just going to be fifteen years this year and that's a tough thing uh|user:oh yeah it's uh that's the finances i guess we're on the subject of finances it is tough uh|agent:i haven't really accomplished that yet but i'm trying	the salary thing TI doesn't quite always do it right well what about our our our financial budget well you you should have a lot of information on a budget then if you're	0
user:one day i gave her the checkbook and i said|agent:right|user:uh one and i always tried to show my wife you know here's how you once a year i'd say here's how you do the budget in case i get sick or here's how you do the checks you know	i'm not doing this anymore you do it you learn it and i've been happy ever since	1
user:he's a college graduate type guy he's been in all he's an entrepreneur and he gives very practical financial advice about|user:inter[national]- oh he's nationally famous|agent:um-hum	cars very	0
agent:you know|user:right i did start a college fund|agent:well you must have done something you're you're helping your children in school and you're	i'm not uh i have one again at UT down there now her first year	1
user:uh|user:and uh|agent:[noise] and and how did your daughter get scholarship money on	band she got you know five hundred dollars at a at a clip	0
agent:um-hum|user:and they don't even have a dozen applicants because uh uh the kids are going off after the big money|user:there's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away churches and everything	uh of course you have to have some sort of record in high school uh of of achievement and everything but sometimes	0
agent:um-hum um-hum|user:shutdown equipment and everything and just being available here i don't mind|user:and i'm working nights just kind of covering uh	uh it beats being laid off and everything and uh you	0
agent:okay|user:another clue for you for college money|agent:um-hum	go to work for UT	1
agent:well i like Mike Ditka|user:oh how come|agent:i think i'm going to have to go with the Chicago Bears	oh yeah	1
agent:and a bunch of and a bunch of money oh yeah|user:uh and with a long term six year contract and they were paying him a lot of money so Walsh|user:well i i think once he goes into training camp with them and gets a full year at uh to do it it it'll work out okay for him i uh you know i uh he didn't have a chance here in Dallas because my gosh Aikman was the number one choice number one draft choice	yeah Walsh didn't have that much uh well as you probably guessed i'm a Cowboy fan	0
agent:oh yeah|user:and i and i may have been the only one that did both because the mentality in Dallas was that you couldn't like both you had to like one and hate the other|agent:ah the old Kansas City Chiefs yeah	and and it was interesting because the AFL	0
user:and so i got the first choice of the two hundred and fifty dollar bonds so i was in the upper deck in the twelfth row on the fifty yard line|agent:good grief|user:and uh i got in the upper tier uh well actually there was two types of seats there were two hundred and fifty dollar bonds and thousand dollar bonds that you had to [laughter-buy]	i wonder if that guy that's in the eleventh row see he bought thousand dollar [laughter-bonds]	0
user:and when it comes their time to choose they get thirty minutes or so|user:on draft day he's got about thirty people that are going out to their potential players|user:yeah well i heard Jerry Jones say something interesting and i and i it must border on legality or ethnicity	these people will negotiate with the players and get them to sign a contract and if they won't sign a contract they won't draft them	1
agent:i got so tired i i guess i just got so tired of hearing about the Dallas Cowboys and and you know what[ever]- whatever the Cowboys did that day|user:were absolutely|agent:and uh	yeah	1
agent:yeah he was pretty good staying on the sidelines with his clipboard but he wasn't he wasn't worth a damn in the game|user:yeah they they sure they sure found out in a hurry that Babe Wassenberg wasn't it didn't they|agent:we sure figured out that old Babe Wassenberg didn't make it	yeah but you know it's it's interesting because old uh uh you know everybody said when they signed Steve Wal boy they're going to have to trade him they're going to have to trade him but you cannot seriously contend uh in the league without two front line quarterbacks	1
user:well unfortunately|agent:but they don't have no say so in it i guess|agent:that we should understand what Bush is doing	the the United States as a government can't get involved in a civil war in another country because it's not	1
agent:that's where he put the chemical weapons before|agent:well that's where he bombed before with the Turks|user:and uh	um-hum	1
user:going into|user:the Iraqis the Kurdish are|agent:<b_aside> David <e_aside>	Ira[n]- to Iran and into Syria i know that the S[audi]- the uh that Saudi Arabia has some pretty strict	0
agent:if you're the|agent:i wish it was as good over here as it is over there but|user:any need that's going to drive them to to petty theft or or to that type of crime	yeah but those uh those countries are so extremely wealthy	0
agent:and and and prices and all of that stuff|agent:and i think that has to do with them having problems with food and|user:yeah yeah	a lot of their their civil problems where they've got their uh Baltic states	1
user:yeah and and|agent:that's the biggest that's the bottom line is it's your choice|agent:yeah more or less just whatever it it's really that choice	yeah	1
user:bye|agent:all {righty} bye-bye|user:i've enjoyed talking to you	[noise]	1
agent:reason for whatever they might be going to do if they found a positive uh|agent:would not be uh accepted as an automatic um|agent:but i would think that um that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that for example that one uh positive	right	1
agent:um-hum|user:anywhere is on drugs or not|agent:um-hum	and it takes some drastic steps at this point	0
user:hum|agent:fairly [laughter-regularly] thinking that you know he he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not i mean he's you know he's so messed up|agent:i mean he he puts himself in the hospital	right	1
agent:there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination|agent:e[ven]- even people who might be of the gay community and i'm not an advocate for that particular [laughter] segment of society but um i think that|agent:that would that you know it would be unfair and people who are on medication for example or um	right	1
agent:i guess if that's all we've done and i guess we've talked long enough|user:well [noise] all right well uh i guess that's about it|agent:[laughter-yeah]	all right	0
agent:um-hum|user:uh my wife has a sailboat so i wind up on the sailboat a lot in the summertime|agent:wow	but it's the winter months that i can get serious about swimming	1
agent:oh|user:and all of them have uh at least a twenty five meter or twenty five yard uh swimming pool|user:park authority uh recreation centers	and in fact out here in Oakton we have uh	0
user:yeah|agent:all that sort of stuff we're not we're not high rollers like Dallas we don't have a pool but [laughter]|agent:but this way you know you can go to the fitness center right from work and they have aerobics and you know all the all this machines and	yeah well i have we have a uh recreation center which is almost right across the street from our uh office	1
agent:um-hum um-hum and and on Saturdays i go to a {jazzercise} class that's my|user:oh you do the aerobic uh dancing then|agent:plus i like to dance you know	yeah well that looks that looks like so much work to me i	1
agent:yeah uh-huh|user:it looks like you're constantly walking up stairs|user:yeah i- i see some of these exercise machines that uh	and uh	0
agent:jeez|user:and uh so that's sixty six lengths of the pool|user:i- i count them_1 i- i swim a sixteen fifty every day	and uh i sometimes i may not be conscious of keeping count but uh	0
agent:it seems like [noise]|user:yeah|agent:and then when you don't for some reason you feel real lethargic	[noise]	1
user:heading for the pool jumping in swimming|user:it amounts to running out the back door and uh|user:just barely	some sprints or something like that and then running back again [laughter]	1
agent:oh really|user:and uh i think she was uh pretty competitive at one point she had a bad accident that uh put her out of competition|agent:um-hum	uh but she's taking up snow skiing and she got me involved	1
user:uh the one we thought would be the most timid|agent:um-hum|user:they went out with their individual personalities and picked it up in their own little way	uh turned out to be the one that stuck with it and was the first to learn	1
agent:do you all have have you had a good snow this year|agent:[laughter]|user:and got started and so she grabbed me by the ear and made me do it this year	we were lucky um	1
agent:yeah [laughter]|user:yeah well i don't know i told my husband i said you go out some to work on the car it's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong i says you go pay to have someone do it|agent:no i- i guess if you make money at it it becomes a vocation then [laughter]	because_1 it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something	1
agent:oh really oh|user:yeah Plattsburgh's kind of a it's uh it's uh depressed economically|agent:Plattsburgh for a while he he remembers lots of snow [laughter]	when you go across the lake um i don't know why we have so much going for us	0
user:and you can make fl[ower]- uh dried flower arrangements and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun and|agent:um-hum|user:flowers that you can dry	we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with uh dried red flowers and dried white flowers and uh eucalyptus	0
user:[laughter]|agent:maybe that's why they're [laughter] so slow i guess they're stoned on the stuff or something|user:yeah it is	yeah it it looks really po[tent]- potent stuff	0
user:for um his kids and he makes uh|agent:routers|user:and s[et]- set him up and h[e]- he makes all kinds of furniture	uh like little kids' furniture	0
agent:so what i'm planting or actually transplanting is a tree that's or trees that are already leafed out|agent:and they come down here and they'll sit in the nurseries here and they'll go ahead and and uh leaf out|agent:i d[on't]- don't know where they came from they come out of nurseries mostly in Missouri and places like that	oh that's good i guess they they say you can plant them_1 in the spring or the fall	0
agent:in Georgia yeah yeah|user:uh it's in Georgia it's yeah it's right outside of Macon and and it's just a|agent:now where is this	i like the way that i like the way that idea of the south is	0
agent:uh what's the word they use anyway a lux[ury]- a luxury tax|agent:i really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes and they call it uh|agent:and uh it burns gas like crazy i only get seven miles to the gallon	yeah	1
user:too much tax considering what we're getting for it and|user:i- i think that we probably are paying a little|user:um	how it's being managed and so forth i mean i- i think there could be a better system and we would get more for our money	0
user:uh you know they're studying some|user:don't seem to have any validity at all i mean they're always far out and|user:that	obscure	0
agent:[noise] oh definitely|user:and i think that's a mistake|user:yeah	somewhere	0
user:disagrees with or you know says hey we're not going to allow that|user:you have something that the IRS|user:um	well i think they're very unfair in the amount of	0
agent:the budget|agent:[noise] i came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the uh|agent:uh that's that's one of my pet peeves	um-hum	1
user:well i- i have another thing that i thought about too um|user:yeah|agent:and they're out worrying about their own income taxes	for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is	0
agent:um me i'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it|user:huh-uh|agent:i mean it's not making ten fifteen percent like a business is today	[laughter]	0
agent:and uh -[un]til next time|user:you too|agent:well anyway Ellen it was nice talking to you	[noise]	1
agent:so i guess from what i understand the thing could just|user:hum|user:uh	start it	1
user:and they fight with each other and they have such hatred for|agent:uh-huh|user:and it's not uh you know there isn't any real Arab coalition because they do fight among themselves	uh Israel and	1
agent:things at all|agent:social or cultural|agent:they they split things along um geographical lines but they didn't take any kind of consideration into uh	right	1
user:[noise] well i just uh i'm not interested in keeping big military over there and|agent:caused problems so|user:right	having to go in and call the shots like you say an[d]-	0
user:uh in there and try to|user:try to keep|user:i don't ho[pe]- [laughter-i'd] i hope we don't	keep our fingers in the pot and try to	0
agent:you know until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but i don't think we want to make that decision either|user:history|agent:i mean uh uh the only way that you're going to have peace over there if if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them	uh-huh	1
agent:yes i i try to grow uh uh a vegetable garden and|user:do you have a garden|user:i see	we do the same thing it's i just have a small plot it's like ten feet by five feet	1
agent:sometimes i i want to plant something there's not enough room to plant it|user:uh-huh|agent:a lot of things a lot of food and	that's right that's right	1
user:yeah|agent:right peas i got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago|user:my wife used to plant a few snow peas i don't really care for snow peas well she just plants a few for herself	did you really	1
agent:and i wal[k]- i mow my own lawn and|user:sure|user:sure	yeah	1
agent:chemical services to come out and spray for weeds and fertilize and all that and take that one step out of the loop but um|agent:yeah sometimes i wish i could get one of these uh|user:last last couple of years i've done it myself	uh-huh	1
agent:when the days start getting a little longer you know you can i can start doing it in the evening after work|agent:right|user:i'm not limited to just mowing it on Saturday morning you know i can do it on most any day of the week	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|user:yeah|user:um-hum	i believe it is too	1
user:that's right|agent:nothing left but a stem they devoured it that quickly|agent:and went up there one day and the plant was	absolutely they really go through it they really do	1
user:i did something a little bit different this year that i haven't done before i've got uh|user:yeah|user:yeah	my garden is shaped that i can it's kind like this uh box shape	0
user:uh-huh|agent:and uh i had sandy loam hauled in i had a dump truck come and dump it|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1

user:oh yeah|user:uh-huh|agent:he lets me you know no problem borrowing if it's just a hassle when you know to go up and it's a fairly large one to heave it up into the back of the van and	yeah	1
agent:oh they they are the best|user:yes i've for the first time we planted them this year uh-huh|user:snow excuse me	yeah	0
user:oh i bet they were|agent:she made these onion rings that were so good and and and uh you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in that it's an ingredient|user:yeah that's kind of a let down	that's right we use a lot [vocalized-noise] we sure do	1

agent:free up|agent:to to|user:i see	uh-huh	1
user:sure|user:yeah|user:yeah that'd be interesting	yeah	0
agent:well if you ever decide to get a newer later model think about an Amiga because it's the slickest machine you've ever seen|agent:uh-huh|user:but for what i need just keeping records it does just fine	oh really	1
user:oh how fanta[stic]-|agent:yeah i'd like to have a piece of software like that for my machine now on my machine i've got a microphone hooked up to it and i can digitize me and the wife and kids all talking and all that but i can hook a VCR up to it and take our picture|agent:well that's neat	how fantastic	1
agent:but research work though i use a Sun Sparc station|user:so you're into com[puters]-|agent:desktop computer	oh	0
agent:PC or a Mac either one|user:i'd never even heard of this|agent:yeah it's kind of neat not to mention the fact that it's got four thousand ninety six colors and you can't get more than two fifty six out of a	so your kids were having a good time and you were working	1
agent:after that you can put it all on floppy disk it might take several|agent:because you can put more than one frame into the machine and then you can describe what's going on you can record it via {microphoning} machine then there's a way to link all that together and once you got it satisfied satisfactory done you can then take it and play it back out of the machine right out the NTSC port in the back to a VCR and record it|user:uh-huh	how much w[ill]-	1
user:guest|user:you know i i wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my|agent:uh-huh	but if it was a formal	0
user:but um|agent:uh-huh|user:crawfish i mean every once in a while you'll see o[ne]- i mean it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident but if the tail is straight on it then yeah don't eat it	you just put some cajun well lots of pepper	0
user:sh[ell]-|user:um if it was more formal like if i was you know working environment then i would probably um|agent:sure	shell them_1 or at least	0
user:or to put in salads or to um|agent:um-hum|user:uh the crawfish tails already peeled an[d]- everything and usually you use those like for frying	you know make a sauce with or something like that but you can go ahead and buy them_1 cooked and shelled and they're more expensive of course but	1
user:[vocalized-noise] oh|agent:before i had my second child we sort of had a contest going where you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and i'd try to outdo him and then he'd try to outdo me and [laughter] we we was really a lot of fun and|user:uh-huh	[laughter]	1
user:maybe|user:um-hum|agent:make sure that they didn't have to do it again [laughter] make hot dogs or some potato chips or	[laughter] i that's about how much i can cook	0
user:and Easter whenever we have at the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce|user:well um my grandma speaking of those meatballs again she um every Christmas and|agent:if you have the time but you know a lot of times it's too it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it	and it has i don't know they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs and they are just absolutely delicious	0
agent:and it gives it a bit of a different consistency|agent:the kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that they use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies|user:um-hum	well um how long do you cook the meatballs	1
user:um|agent:uh-huh|user:future husband will be you know he's going to be working for Chevron in Houston so he's going to be	[noise]	0
user:[laughter]|agent:i- i think we've we've covered the subject i've got some interesting information about crawfish i was in fact i was it's good cause i was curious about that today when i saw those for sale|agent:well	oh yes you need to try them_1 oh they're wonderful	1
agent:because there just aren't are not any left hardly around up in this area|user:um-hum|agent:good service people	i believe that	1

agent:so called garages are now a convenience stores that sell gasoline and they really don't do any repairs anymore so|agent:all of our|user:um-hum	right	1
agent:uh-huh|user:but un[fortunately]- unfortunately they buried this one in the sixty six Mazdas|agent:i'm sure you could of	you have to remove the dash and the fuse box to get to the motor	1
user:i suppose but i had a hundred and|agent:the retooling cost were probably prohibitive to most companies you know|agent:it's a smooth running quiet car i i just i don't know why well perhaps the	twenty eight thousand on it when i sold it	1
agent:a[nd]- and they really really they come down and pound you real hard if they catch you dumping oil on the ground because it does go in and it effects the lakes and streams and it eventually winds up on the ocean here and it really makes a mess around around New England|user:well that's good|agent:we're we're really on an ecology kick up here i guess like all the rest of the country and	sure	1
agent:uh|user:hum yeah that's true|agent:but if if i were forced to do it that may be a different situation	well it's been good talking to you	1
agent:we're discrete well are not discrete uh electronic devices|user:oh okay|agent:uh no i think that maybe the the automation people that are	oh	1
agent:that that all have airbags|agent:well have you been listening to Iaccoca's arguments that uh that Chrysler products are the only ones|user:or we're gonna buy an economy car how do you like that [laughter]	yeah	1
agent:that if the door came open the lady would fall out i mean and|agent:if if it it surely didn't come as a surprise that|agent:that really sc[ared]- i guess i that that a little more than scared me that irritated me uh that because it	well you know what the average person would you ever have thought of that	1
agent:to serious injury even though they were they were still locked in the the forced to go so really if your sitting in the backseat|agent:the combination of stretching the spine to uh par[alyze]- i mean|agent:into the front seat and there was enough stretching	right	1
user:and we wanted to travel well that was really nice traveling but|user:uh-huh|agent:well but the did you did you go to Florida in a van	you know i like to know more	1
user:a Ford Ford what you remember|user:a what|user:yeah well now this one that we went in it did baby what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in	he was trying to think of what the name of it was	1

agent:uh-huh|user:listen and and also read between the lines [laughter-you] [laughter-know]|user:the other thing that i think is good for like American businesses are to be involved is the the reports that i hear back and of course on the news i i try to	but uh they said that because the Americans you know took such a proactive stance i[nvolvement]- involvement in the war that like so much of the buil[ding]- business and rebuilding Kuwait and things like that will go to American businesses where as before they may be dealt with Japanese firms or other people	0
agent:go over there and rebuild all those|agent:right|user:your oil companies they may see a probably the first big rise in business they've seen in years [laughter]	um-hum	1
agent:right|agent:got t[o]- help us|user:but i know that that's causing him a little bit of unpopularity with the people over there because they feel like geez y[ou]- you told us to stand up against him but you're not helping and so i think he's in a pretty awkward position now and i i i think we ought to help	you know	1
agent:and i think the people were smart enough to realize that you know Huss[ein]- that that i think they're afraid of him is what they are the population i[s]- is afraid to speak out against him and|agent:and uh|user:sure	uh	1
agent:and it's not getting any better the sanctions are still on|user:yeah|user:yes	that's true	1
agent:trying to connect with Israel all that time and there really was no connection at all|agent:and uh|user:right	none	1
user:even women who do stay home to raise families i think that|agent:uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh|user:you know played a really subservient role in the family and i just don't see that anymore at all	they are still thought of as equals	0
user:well|agent:uh been in positions similar to men for that many years relative to how long men have had those types of positions|user:yeah	that's true	0
user:and then too i think that|user:yeah|user:yeah	you know i think a lot of women who have been forced into the workplace unwittingly just because it you know to raise a family nowadays it it takes two incomes	0
agent:over a couple of generations time it will all change because it's really been|agent:the household chores and duties and what has to be done so i think|user:yeah	yeah i	0
user:you know i really resent that in that i don't have that choice to be able to stay home with my child|user:uh|agent:uh-huh	but uh	0
user:you know|user:and i'm not very political so i don't really know|agent:yeah	any i don't know any statistics on you know how many women run for public office	0
agent:we have a woman mayor|user:in San Antonio well|agent:no i live in San Antonio	do yeah yeah you do now [laughter]	0
agent:i'm not sure|user:yeah that's ri[ght]- why i asked if she was elected or if it if it was something that was passed passed down to her through|agent:[noise] i i'm thinking it might have been the kind of deal where her husband was governor and he died or something	through the ways that the laws work	1
user:uh-huh|agent:just for American prejudice but the world several major countries in the world that we deal with all the time don't respect women as business people|agent:if not just for the	is that right	1
agent:um-hum bad deals with friends [laughter]|agent:oh definitely|agent:uh-huh	uh	1
agent:yeah but still i- i health and health and everyth[ing]- i mean if yeah|agent:yeah but|user:well yes but he's in very poor health so you know twenty months may mean a lot longer for him	but still	1
agent:i mean there may be more that they are prosecuting but Dickson is the only one i even heard of|agent:well they need to prosecute the people who are taking the millions and millions a lot a lot better than they are have been Dickson is the only one i even heard of|user:that is scary i didn't think about that	they must be getting some on the national level i think i've read various things but i just no names come to mind	1
agent:oh well you don't pay we we keep full coverage down here on everything|user:and i'm paying i mean every quarter i'm paying like five hundred dollars a year|agent:right	and that	1
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:and i think reading the newspaper for that type of thing is a waste of time because they're there to sell newspapers	that's the problem with the news both the	0
agent:yes but no because they uh they left their loan hanging|agent:and i mean i mean they left well|user:smart move	oh did they	1
EMPTY	well i wondered if i was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this to[pic]-	0
agent:do you work outside the home|user:sometimes i think i am going crazy trying to do it but|agent:um-hum	yes	1
user:i think the longest was less than a year but still|agent:um-hum|user:i was at home for a couple of different periods of time oh	at least i was able to to spend you know those first months with them	1
agent:i uh it it was it's a way for me to stay home|agent:taxes and bookkeeping and|user:oh	um-hum	1
agent:setting a trend here or|agent:what do you think do you think we're|agent:place of employment and and things like that that will help out	i don't yeah i well i see i think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children	0
user:but it would be nice if there could be an|agent:right it is a very personal thing|user:completely give that up	in-between	0
agent:[noise]|agent:bye-bye|user:all right good-bye	[noise]	1
agent:well and now the way they're uh treating those Kurds is that what they its terrible and we've just kind of backed off i don't understand that why we|user:uh probably could have struck a deal with the Saudi's and just let them_1 have Iraq|user:i think they should have just kept right on going into Baghdad	um yeah	1
agent:[noise]|user:it it was certainly foreseeable right after the war i mean it should have been obvious if it it was obvious to me it should have been obvious to the people in Washington there should have been some plans to|user:i don't know	try to give them_1 some aid i mean we helped the Afghanistanis there's know reason why we shouldn't have helped the Kurds	1
user:yeah|agent:his own people|user:i really expected to have a	i expected some of his generals and stuff to	0
user:they they think completely differently the way we from the way we do|user:i don't either it's it's tough to understand those Middle Eastern types anyway|agent:see that's what i don't understand	i've got several Middle Middle Eastern friends uh my my father was stationed in Iran many years ago and i was a little boy there	1
agent:how long were you over there|user:never wanted [laughter-to]|user:nope never have	uh we were there for four years	1
agent:boy and you couldn't get them_1 over hear for [laughter]|agent:yeah|user:those are very nice	well you ca[n]- you can but they're expensive	1
user:yeah they do|agent:and they probably they do it all by hand probably|user:they make nice carpet	the good ones are you can tell the machine made ones	1
user:they're nice though i- i like them i'm|agent:oh okay|user:it looks like our carpet where you just have a flat backing and then the thing is knitted into this backing	still negotiating i'm trying to get a couple of them_1 for myself	1
user:the the the wages are tremendously high|user:lots and lots of them_1 and it it it's a it's a real financial boom for them because|user:um	i mean they got all that money and they don't have anybody to pay it to	1
user:yeah yeah|agent:well they're still shooting down planes every now and then|user:a lot of them_1 a lot of airplanes a lot of ground forces	honey i uh [vocalized-noise] what we did i mean you know telling uh	0
user:it it it's going to go on forever|agent:for thousands of years|user:no they've been fighting for thousands of years and it will be they'll fight for thousands of more years	um the thing that surprises me really is that Israel's sitting there in the middle of all this	1
user:yeah oh yeah|agent:oh i didn't even know they were turning any away [noise]|user:i don't eith[er]- well um you know the[y]- what you don't hear about is how many they turn away	they'll help them_1 relocate somewhere else but but they're not they're they're filling up to fast and they're they're just getting to many diverse groups there and that's	1
user:they're sitting there it it it makes me wonder and they've they've got the capability|agent:and they just didn't do anything did they they're just kind of sitting there|user:i'm i'm really surprised that Israel didn't take care of Saddam a long time ago	and they've got the people	1
user:[vocalized-noise]|user:oh i bet|agent:and when it's you know not nice and they can't go out it's really the [laughter-pits] so i appreciate it when at lat[ely]- they can at least go play in the backyard for an hour or something you know	yeah	0
agent:i miss some miss seasons that you know that we used to get up there that you just don't have down here|user:um-hum|agent:hot and it's just you never really have like nice cool sixty five or seventy degree weather with sunshine you know and i really miss that i'm from Chicago originally and	well i know in um	0
agent:oh [laughter]|user:and everyone kept saying oh you're going up north it's not going to be so hot it's not going to be so humid and|user:in uh July	yeah that has just not been the case	0
agent:but here if you don't water it just looks awful|user:sure|user:no	brown	1
agent:oh boy|user:you know you had to have a supply like uh emergency supply on hand all the time|user:big concern about hurricanes because_1 we're close enough to the coast and	during the hurricane season and	0
user:but uh at least there isn't|agent:yeah|agent:but	at least [vocalized-noise] i feel like i got rid of something	1
agent:yeah yeah|user:but it is like you say coming a little bit further up north|agent:yeah	it's a little bit nicer to have a Spring and a Fall season	1
agent:[laughter-oh] [laughter-really] [laughter]|user:it's you know has it like from one foot to four foot and i thought i would never buy a house|agent:um-hum	were there is a flood gauge down the street	1
user:there seems to be quite a bit that the individual can do as far as air pollution and one thing|user:some people have a lot to say on and some don't care much for it at all but uh i found that there's|user:a topic that uh	it kind of hits the old pocketbook a little bit but if you can just keep the	0
agent:you know i mean fireplaces their great but you can get you know one hundred percent clean burning natural gas in your fireplaces and i mean you know most of the fireplaces are for ambience anyway they're not that efficient|user:yeah that's true|agent:well you know i- i think fireplaces are great but you know you really don't have to have wood	yeah	0
agent:they've just got to find other fuels|agent:if uh and i think you know that alone that alone would just cut down so immensely on that we've we've also i mean the fact of the matter is is that you know|user:um-hum	that's true yeah	1
user:suburbs to downtown Dallas as it were and it's a good|user:they gather the monies from the other counties and the other suburbs and and run the DART system throughout the|user:DART's problem he[re]- the you know the Metroplex itself suburbs and all i[t]- it's a pretty hefty uh distance from one suburb to the southern suburb so they they run uh	forty or so miles in each direction just about and they also try to run city to city with you know around	0
user:oh i think the last time i looked at it was about had a dollar fifty one way|user:plus it would cost me|agent:sure	and i said no i'm not going to do that	1
user:um|agent:the ozone layer it is probably responsible our US shuttle|agent:of these fluorocarbons into	that's interesting	1
user:yeah|agent:we don't have to use those as a matter of fact it wasn't designed that way initially at all the solid uh propellant rockets were a uh you know were time saving money saving afterthought|agent:and we could remodel that system you know	right	1
user:catch those who might not be and and k[inds]- and the kinds of problems that they can cause in the work environment or even outside the work environment i hate to think about|user:it's one way to uh try to uh|user:that uh	uh the fact that uh i might have someone on the job who takes drugs	0
user:um|user:short or long periods of time uh|user:so it seems to me that uh even though i i personally think it's a good idea that there does need to be some some uh thought given to it some serious thought about how you can do it how you can exempt people at least the s[erious]- periods of time	who are on prescription drugs or maybe come up with some other way of being able to test them	1
agent:uh|agent:the uh the problem with testing uh now they test athletes they test horses uh [laughter] they test uh|agent:um	right now they test athletes for uh	1
user:um-hum|user:um-hum um-hum|agent:well now just stop and think of of um um NASA for example all the people who work for NASA are uh of course here in Dayton we have uh Wright Patterson Air Force uh uh base right here where there's so much research going on uh if these people uh are on drugs uh it doesn't the test results uh the results which they are	base uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:doing nothing but resolving problems with schools that were assigned to me that couldn't be resolved on a local level which could be a complaint on a principal or a teacher or a riot a bus action stabbing taking parents to court kids to court and what have you and i was on the east end of Dayton which is primarily Appalachian|user:um-hum um-hum	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|agent:but uh you know there are a lot of things we think in terms of drugs we think of crack we think of heroin we think of marijuana we forget that there are other types of of uh uh habituating drugs that are used [noise] that are just as dangerous [noise] as as the others|user:um-hum	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:and uh you know|user:well i agree i i concur a hundred percent i really do|agent:absolutely and i think it should start right with our legislatures	and uh it's not the sort of issue the people go and petition the legislatures to do	0
agent:and they they talking with the children on that level and that's to me the level where you need to have it you can't wait till their already in high school because they've already tried it long before then|user:um-hum|agent:and the police departments uh in all the communities ar[ound]- in and around the the Dayton area have teams which go into the schools in the first second and third grades	um-hum	1
agent:and losing one run games|user:um-hum|agent:who does uh uh it's essentially trivial statistics but they've got a st[atistic]- it's a statistic that has to do with winning	i've heard of that one	1
user:um-hum|agent:and uh and the point of of i- i guess i don't understand the the strategy of how baseball works but it seems that you know they can sign him tomorrow and he could go in the team the next day and and and they put him in the lineup and he hits a home run and all of a sudden he becomes a hero|agent:well it it's an interesting concept though when you look at uh of of how baseball how apparently i was reading in the paper tonight that the Detroit Tigers are going to sign him	yeah well that's true	1
user:i think the Royals will|agent:yeah well how do you think the Royals are going to do|user:uh score enough runs to be able win in these uh in this day and age so	do okay they have they have several pitchers that had badly years last year and they are they're these	0
agent:ye[ah]- everybody does right|user:i lived in the suburbs of Saint Louis yeah|agent:y[ou]- did you actually live in Saint Louis	[laughter-yeah] [laughter-that's] [laughter-true] [laughter-too] [laughter] i think that's all that they have	1
user:um then it really doesn't give you any indication but if they were|user:if in Spring [crain/training] training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them_1 do|user:what they were you know what they were looking for in other words if	uh playing the people that they're going to play then that might be pretty good indication so you know it's it's it's not a great indication because	0
user:um-hum|agent:well is there enough money that's part of it i oh oh that was part of Skip Bayless argument i don't know if you read Skip Bayless but|user:uh build up and stuff like that and	no	1
agent:if you're probably going if if you if you compare to go to a a sport a a say you go to a rock concert or or even a performance uh|agent:and uh you know i mean i i guess as we get older|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
user:to be doing what they're doing|agent:right|user:yeah it's amazing um [vocalized-noise] i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough i mean	uh	0
agent:right that's true|user:[vocalized-noise] but it if it doesn't start at home it's not gonna go anywhere|agent:exactly	uh	1
user:they start raising taxes for property|user:for grade school and junior high and high school kids that's the only way they're gonna fund it because_1|user:the best way but i think wh[at's]- what's gonna have to happen is there's gonna have to be tuition	and people are gonna throw a fit	1
agent:right|user:and now you know what we have now you know got kids that Rusty because_1 he like you know a a a Magnum gun in school like good grief|user:no	i mean i wou[ld]- i'd be afraid to be in school i mean b[e]- teaching or even a being a student and	0
agent:that's right|user:you know and and if they go to their friends dealing drugs they're gonna be in even worse shape|agent:exactly	and and the schools don't don't really encourage to stay away from that you know the schools are there teach history and that we fought the civil war etcetera etcetera they don't teach them_1 good values like drugs are bad i don't maybe i'm wrong may[be]- because_1 i haven't you know been in that kind of environment for a long time but	0
agent:[noise] no you just just talk [laughter]|user:does this give us the signal i guess not okay|agent:family reunions	um	1
agent:yeah yeah|user:in the family so we have to|user:there quite a few children	try to find a time when everybody can be there and we've	1
agent:so uh yeah and i don't know do you do anything special to make it interesting|agent:uh until we moved out here|user:uh-huh	well uh	1
agent:and uh it's wonderful it's uh uh i mean|user:ah|agent:and so uh it's sort of it's it's it's a sort of a high class potluck i guess you could say	get all those good family favorites	1
user:uh|user:it is it's wonderful|user:yeah at football games	my next family reunion with my family will be	0
agent:of course the new thing is the Nintendo|agent:you know|user:right	[laughter]	1

agent:so uh it's usually some kind of uh semi reunion [laughter]|agent:and then so we're [vocalized-noise] when we're in New Hampshire everybody else is in that area anyway and usually somebody will drive in from New York|agent:but uh	right well we go to Maine	0
agent:yeah i always thought that would be kind of might be kind of fun you know especially with a class reunion where you have to|user:that's pretty interesting|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:no i could smell an accent a mile away|user:oh your kidding|user:[laughter]	oh isn't that fu[n]- only people from there can tell everyone else is where did you get that weird accent	1
agent:[noise]|user:high school and going to college how could you know i wonder how they could possibly|agent:enforcement	uh if this would be a voluntary thing or a mandatory	1
agent:and when they're younger not when they're getting into undergraduate and college age|agent:[noise]|user:um or have the class but as part of that or part of the credit would be to do something like that on a voluntary basis	yeah yeah i i uh i really i'm bewildered as far as how they could even work something like this in if they try to make it mandatory	1
user:right|agent:we're in a yeah that's we're in a near next to a town called Plano Texas and it's very um it's like Falls Church Alex[ander]- i mean Montgomery County i'm familiar with where you're at um and they really that's a good way to put it i know|agent:yeah that's	yeah	1

agent:yeah|user:and uh but what's even worse is the off year congressional elections uh when there's not a presidential election uh and the local election|user:you know the thing that that i [vocalized-noise] surprised me even more you know if we got a good contest going uh we do manage to get fifty percent out in national elections	and it bothers me and i- i think that's even more important to vote in those because uh	1
agent:oh [laughter]|user:while it was uh talking about it and then i it took so long for someone to answer i started reading the newspaper and kind of forgot about it [laughter-but] uh|user:um-hum i like to read too [laughter] i was trying to think of some while	yeah i i'd say reading's probably one of my biggest ones because it's the type of thing that you can you can do a little bit at a time whereas i would love to do crafts and stuff if i just had the time to do it and	0
agent:things to hang on the wall|agent:what else have i [laughter-done]|agent:and um	um-hum	1
agent:and uh i[t]- it was just too much to begin with and i think that kind of discouraged me from doing much more [laughter-with] it|agent:to to get it done and there were so many different shadings and colors and|user:yeah	yeah that's pretty [laughter-understandable]	1
user:um|user:i have right now i have the movie channel so i've i've recorded quite a few movies off of that|agent:um-hum	just i've kind of got a collection going of tapes now and	0

agent:and then all the software tends to be uh|agent:and then i have one that i do just general purpose work on and then for the house i don't have anything uh not that i wouldn't want one but i would probably not be satisfied with anything less than a really nice one and that's that's a quite an expense|agent:a variety of of uh speeds and complexity of machines depending upon the instrument that it's controlling	[noise]	1
user:uh|user:Works and WordPerfect|user:what you see is what you get editor for almost all of my word processing so i have not although i have access at home to things like	but i i do no[t]- obviously notice it i i think the thing that surprises me most when i change work to home environment is the cursor speed and after i if initially get over the uh	0

agent:well i know the choice to either work or to be a mother is probably pretty difficult because i think women just naturally tend to have those instincts that you you know you protected the children and you you want to be with the children yet|user:um|agent:right	um-hum	1
agent:um-hum|agent:right|agent:um-hum	um	0

agent:well|user:and uh yeah there there there should be thousands of people in jail as far as i'm concerned|user:they just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property	not just a couple	1
user:and thinking that there was a bottomless pit and it always would [vocalized-noise] it always would increase you know it always would uh|user:not all of it i don't know how much he lost but uh they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate|agent:yeah	uh be more than what you paid for it and they just never even got conservative with our money at all	1
agent:for what they would cost and we weren't producing anything|agent:and|user:yeah	yeah	1
user:it it still a lot of the workers don't understand that uh they need to put out the best that they can|user:people and the economy and everything else i i feel bad when i see the inefficiency even here at TI you know and i think that the|user:well i do have a lot of confidence in the the American	because it comes right back to them you know	1
agent:and uh i am degreed though nonexempt|user:yeah|agent:the badge is silver	uh well that's good	1
user:essentially standby and problems uh all all nights and weekends that's my i only get one weekend off a month right now|user:weekends and nights now i'm i'm one of the manager reps there's three of us to cover in Dallas facilities and just we're|user:i'm calling you from work i- i- i- i'm i'm covering uh	i call it my recession job	0

user:yeah|user:yeah|agent:when the door shuts that one person has total control you know and i always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around and if you get one bad apple there's are at least other people that can see it they can watch and	yeah	1
agent:but i thought okay i'm going to keep an open mind here and the new people that came in it just wasn't it just wasn't the same and their their attitude and philosophy was just completely opposite from mine and i|user:oh gosh|user:yeah	right	1
agent:yeah i bet [laughter]|agent:right|agent:right	to go back to work and my youngest was only uh two and a half	0
user:nine and a half|user:so now they're a year older and i my daughter's eleven going to be eleven this summer and my son will be|agent:yeah that stuff is expensive it really is	and so	0

user:and uh|user:in the same area with no walls|agent:oh [laughter]	and then he'd get on the Amrein's Bus to go to Amrein's	0
user:yeah|user:right right|user:yeah	it is	1
user:you're kidding|user:oh my gosh you are kidding|user:right	oh that's great	1
agent:[vocalized-noise] it's Bright Steps in Louisville and whenever you say Bright Steps everybody goes oh i've heard that's the best day care in town you know and it's it's one of those that's very hard to get into and they have this this this woman owns three day cares two in Lewisville and one in Irving and she had to open the second one up in Lewisville because her waiting list was just like you know like a year old it was ridiculous and she's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other you know so its i mean she's|user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:that's right and his old day care as much as i loved it you know and the owner i really liked her and she worked really hard to get good people but the people that she got were there because they weren't qualified to do anything else you know and and i got lucky and all of his teachers were very good|agent:that's right that's right|agent:yeah	uh-huh	1
agent:you know and there were places that were cheaper but is it you know your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money you know and i have peace of mind where he is and some of those other places i wouldn't have|user:uh-huh|user:right right	no yeah	1
agent:well it can kill your diet [laughter]|agent:oh yeah|user:you know you really i really enjoy eating out here [laughter]	and	1
agent:they've got a great salad bar too|user:but the atmosphere's nice and|agent:yeah	yeah you can you can just make a meal out of the salad bar	1
agent:well when we lived in in Dallas uh unti[l]- up until last last year so uh we lived close to Addison so we w[ent]- went to a lot of places ov[er]- over there|user:so|agent:[laughter] yeah oh yeah really	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah|user:S[teak-N-Ale]- Steak-N-Ale is a treat too i really like that but|user:um i like uh i think going to	uh	1
agent:oh you j[ust]- you j[ust]- can't do that [laughter]|user:some people you know they just go out almost every night you know and i'm like|user:yeah it's a real treat to go so	no no	1
agent:several places uh On The Border is okay but it is so expensive even at lunch time it's just not worth it|agent:i've been to|user:yeah	uh-huh	1
agent:with ta[gging]- tagging the {kiddos} along you know|user:it is|agent:with uh	uh-huh	0
user:oh you're not kidding it i[s]- that's why we've only been there a couple times yeah that|user:oh|agent:i can't wait -[un]til mine gets old enough to do [laughter-that] oh that place will cost you a fortune	you might when you go	1
agent:hum|user:it's an indoor amusement park you you're|agent:i've never heard of that	child's probably too young isn't she	0
user:yeah|agent:yeah|user:yeah [noise] yeah i think they enjoy going out too it's a treat for them too so	well	0
agent:and a grand jury|user:um-hum|agent:why do we have sometimes a petit jury isn't it	uh okay it depends on the kind of action it is and also depends on the state	0
agent:for a murder trial a few weeks ago|agent:when you have both like i was called|user:uh whe[n]- when do you have what a jury	um-hum	1
user:and it's s[trange]- strange that there would have been a jury there because evidentiary hearings are u[sually]- are just before the judge|user:um|user:once a person is indicted then they generally have an evidentiary hearing	now it's possible they had another trial	1
agent:well i'll tell you something i think ought to be changed|agent:yeah|user:so you were proba[bly]- probably being tapped for the jury for the trial	what's that	1
agent:[noise]|user:yeah|user:um-hum	well it's it's hard to get out of jury duty i mean it's uh it's an obligation	0
user:uh uh they'll ask you questions like do you know the defendant have you heard anything about the case|user:i mean the thing is uh the easiest way to get out of one of these things is uh|user:well as long as they didn't question you too closely	do you have any uh	0
agent:um-hum|user:the fact that you're willing the fact that you believe in it doesn't uh doesn't matter of course they're going to ask you ca[n]- do you think you could impose it in this case|agent:um	and you know i that that to me that's always been a stupid question i- i mean i don't know i haven't heard the evidence yet [laughter]	1
agent:yeah|user:yeah he's going to turn states evidence|agent:so that he'll get a lesser sentence	God	1
user:yeah that that's|agent:but then i've heard that won't make a difference either|agent:i'm not going to be summoned i mean out of four hundred i'm not going to be one of the twelve especially see i put that down that that guy had told me that	well it may because it it's something that could have influenced your your your uh	0
agent:what do you think can we change the system|agent:well|user:that's going to be enough	well there's been all kinds of talk about it but quite honestly i don't think there's anything else that we could put in place that would work	0
user:i mean you see that's what it all comes down to it's the jury|user:y[ou]- you know if you've got if you've got a reasonable jury who will look at the evidence|user:you can have a whole bunch of money and you can have the best lawyers but	uh	0
user:as much|agent:uh-huh|user:oh you mean a court appointed lawyer yeah there's there's little doubt that i mean obviously a court appointed lawyer doesn't have the time or the resources to do	but	0
user:and uh|agent:ten|user:ten	you know how they are at that age i guess	1
agent:um-hum|user:time we spend with our children|user:anyway uh	it seems almost as though	0
user:you know|user:they|user:i	parents are a curse that they just have to live with	1
agent:um-hum [noise] i know it|user:especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner|agent:um-hum um-hum	and that creates family tensions	1
user:friends are cool parents aren't|agent:oh yeah [laughter] no huh-uh|user:they'd much rather be with friends	but i remember [laughter]	0
user:and it seems that|agent:oh yeah|user:um great times	well now the bank's not available	1
agent:and i enjoy it but|user:[noise]|user:and th[e]- and	well	1
agent:huh no i think not|user:so is that quality time|agent:[laughter] uh	yeah if	1
agent:but i guess they learn from their friends don't they|user:oh yeah|agent:[laughter] and McDonald's [laughter] i- i've always said that if i had a kid they wouldn't know what McDonald's is	yeah but	1
agent:it is|user:and uh|agent:yeah	kids eat funny	1
agent:yeah oh is that where you're from|user:of course that's not the way i was raised being raised in West Texas|agent:[noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise]	oh yeah	1
user:but|user:uh|agent:[laughter]	Jenny is a sweet kid	0
agent:[noise]|agent:i know i don't know how people can afford kids|agent:um-hum	you know	1
agent:i heard it's twenty bucks a whack for adults|agent:it's uh|user:i understand Six Flags is real expensive now	oh yeah	1
user:uh Disney Land or|user:you know a trip to Six Flags or Disney World or|user:well our problem is that	God forbid Disney World would take forever	1
agent:on newspaper combined with television|agent:i rely primarily on|user:since i called	huh uh y[ou're]- you're the opposite of me i drive	1
user:yeah i find it surprising because_1 a lot of times i[t]- here you know i'll talk to some people here and i'll mention someone's|agent:that's rather interesting|user:items uh so i'm i'm a real radio buff especially on the w[eekends]- when i'm doing chores	some talk host	0
user:and talks about a lot of financial things but the here i just get a kick out of uh|user:remember the name Bruce Williams and he he is n[ational]- again national|user:he's on all stations you might	well we do a lot of gardening here so there's we have an excellent gardener here has three hours on Sunday and three hours on Saturday	0
user:good|agent:i think i respect the from a journalistic perspective current events i've always said that it it's really not interesting unless it's three weeks old and and found its way into a a news weekly headline|agent:i	[laughter] that's a good point that's a good point	1
agent:uh and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of Raleigh than than the paper would have anyway|user:yeah you're right|agent:right so i think we find out what's happening in the city uh on a fairly frequent basis over a over a gin and tonic sort of thing	my wife i you know it mentioned the the question was uh do you get it from people too and i i can say the same thing you do that uh	0
agent:okay|user:y[eah]- well it is CNN exactly|user:yeah i[t]-	uh because_1 uh	0
user:uh|user:me turn this mic[rophone]- radio off i'm i'm actually at work right now believe it or not [noise]|user:as well as watching CNN and uh TV here at work i don't have CNN at home	where was i go ahead y[our]- y[our]- your turn	1
agent:no not at all and yet long enough if we were calling back and forth it would be a toll call|agent:i [laughter-see] [laughter-okay]|user:oh you're [vocalized-noise] in Dallas [laughter] not very long distance [laughter]	[laughter]	1
user:yes one time|agent:have you ever served on a on a jury trial|user:[noise]	one time	0
agent:his guilt or innocence yeah|user:yeah whether he's guilty or n[ot]- yeah|agent:i- i don't know i thought that was easier than than trying to decide	that's true	1
user:you'd have to be really really really sure that he did it|user:it would be hard to sentence somebody to death if you weren't really really really sure|agent:yes it would	i mean really sure	1
agent:oh|agent:yeah|user:so you know i come out pretty good on it i mean i ge[t]- and plus my TI money i come out real good on it [laughter-now] the last one i served on i was working at TI and so i got time off for it but i was working third shift and that made it a little difficult	to decide	1
agent:um-hum|user:because someone might see something that you don't see i mean you know they may have they may have picked up on something that gave them that doubt that|agent:i think i do too	you know yeah i really think everybody needs to agree	1
user:uh wanted to find him guilty because he kept saying he did it|user:i can't remember how many it didn't take us but an hour i think or an hour and a half we were all pretty i think we had one man in there that|agent:well it took us six hours to reach agreement yeah	then we kept saying he did it [laughter-but] the other guy you know y[eah]- we had to convince him that um	1
agent:went through the whole family and stuff|agent:and who he married and then how many children we had and then like his brothers and sisters and it|user:uh-huh	oh that's so neat	1
agent:uh-huh|user:[laughter] that's kind of how my husband and i are i have a kind of a big family and he just has himself and his brother and his parents|user:[laughter]	and that's it so he had to kind of get used to [laughter-us] [laughter-when] [laughter-we] first	0
user:um-hum|user:um-hum|agent:family reunion is having everybody just cook whatever is their specialty and bring it	um-hum	1
user:they did|agent:um they just stayed with different ones of them_1 they just came down and|user:did you put them_1 up in other peoples houses or did you have hotel rooms or how'd you do it	um-hum	1
user:the problem is we are all really scattered around there isn't any one place where most of us live so if we ever had a reunion we'd kind of all have to stay in a hotel i mean|user:i don't think we'd need a whole church but um|user:well i'm real curious because_1 my family i didn't sound i don't think my family is as big as [laughter] your [laughter-husband's]	you know there'd be one person who lived there that would have a house but they couldn't put everybody up so it i think it would get kind of expensive	1
user:uh-huh|agent:a convention type thing and then it has little rooms off of it where you know you'd go and sleep at night time but then it has like a kitchenette and things like that but y[ou]-|user:a house or something	oh	1
agent:calling different places can real[ly]- really run you up a bill|user:yeah|user:you get a	yeah	1
agent:because_1 i didn't have any of them left but um|user:uh-huh|agent:this was before i lost a lot more of my family but it wasn't any of my immediate family anyway	uh-huh	1
agent:okay then those in turn got a hold of these other ones and they had like i think there was four or five different people|user:right|user:uh-huh	um-hum	1
agent:but it turned out so much better like that because|user:there yeah yeah|user:[laughter]	yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:then they sent their little things to us okay it was up to me|user:yeah	um-hum	1
user:yeah|agent:you know that we paid for the book to be printed and it's not uh it's not a hard back book it's just a|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:my grandparents told us when i was growing up and even when i was an adult they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their|user:i just the thing is i know a lot of stories but i can't remember who it was about|user:um-hum um-hum	cousins and their f[riends]- best friends because_1 they all grew up in New York City	0
agent:uh-huh|user:uh it i guess i was just old enough not to uh be very comfortable in it|user:but that was just me i know many people are co[mfortable]- very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants	how about_1 you	1
agent:i have seen a few people do it though but they they weren't overly sho[rt]- and they weren't overly revealing they were pretty much in good taste but um for me i just|user:[laughter]|agent:showing too much le[g]- i don't know i wouldn't want to wear a mini skirt to work	um-hum	1
agent:right [laughter]|user:but uh the miniskirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want|agent:right	and and then uh then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy	1
agent:uh-huh|user:and that pleased me|agent:right	uh and uh so then i of course just continued what i considered the best style of clothing for me at work and uh and i find even [vocalized-noise] even at home here now i- i will wear blue jeans or i'll wear shorts	0
user:right|user:[laughter]|agent:right that's what i one thing i like about TI is that they aren't overly strict about what you wear and they don't you know your boss doesn't come up to you and say now remember tomorrow you have a meeting so you'd better wear a suit i mean they they leave it up to you and your judgment to to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have the only real restrictions they have are	yes	1
user:did have a group come over from one of the banks over the children's hospital where i was volunteering|agent:[laughter] right [laughter]|user:yeah well i don't either unfortunately i don't have to work in those companies [laughter] but uh i- i uh	and uh they were doing a presentation and	0
user:[laughter]|agent:and i won't be for a while it's kind of called not having the money but [laughter] i always like to look at what's out there are you looking at cars right now|agent:no i'm not uh	i'm not looking right now but i have been considering what i would purchase uh in the near future	1
agent:any other car|agent:what makes them select that over|agent:and i really don't know	i don't know i've been told to check out the uh Acura Legend first though	1
agent:you know another thing is is they don't age they always look the same so you really don't know what what year it is|agent:[noise] i agree with you there i have uh a friend who has one and|user:i think they're kept in uh better condition than uh most other cars	uh-huh	0

agent:yeah|user:early enough to get them_1|agent:yeah i can see that	but uh fortunately the other end of the deal is some days my wife uh	1
agent:we [laughter] tightened some belt|agent:so we uh|agent:that uh we were we were located in	um-hum	1
agent:so it was|user:that's it|user:that	of course you couldn't have known two to three years ago when you were making this decision what the taxes were going to do now the child care what you do pay doesn't not even worth a hill of beans on your tax return	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and uh we found it cheaper even during the summer for me to uh take off for half a day since we work a four and a half day work week|agent:yeah	and come home on these Thursdays that she goes to work at uh eleven and get's off at seven thirty at night	0
user:throughout the summer so|agent:yeah|user:to take care of them on those Thursdays	it it's hard to	0
agent:oh yeah a lot of people drive into Dallas from Pl[ano]- from here a lots of them_1|agent:that's true|user:i guess with all the ones around the Plano area and figuring that most of them_1 drive south for their jobs maybe they maybe they've done it that way and going with that logic [vocalized-noise]	yeah	1
agent:yeah uh interior's not so bad i[t's]- because it's more fun it's more c[onvenient]- but you get outside where you have high peaks and those kind of things it can be a real issue|user:exterior yeah|agent:exterior	well	1
user:but they obviously had been done without to much uh wear afterward [noise] the only problem was when we started having the movers move the the uh furniture in we identified the various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood uh|user:[noise] the um it had been vacant for a while because the family had retired to Arizona but the daughter was a real estate agent and she was selling it and it'd been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house [noise] so she told us that the house had been uh professionally painted recently and it looked pretty good you know the interior walls all basically white|agent:um-hum	the door frames	0
agent:bye-bye|agent:thank you very much|user:okay [laughter] thank you bye	[noise]	1

user:chooses a government that's not you know exactly the kind of government that we have|user:i wish we didn't have to i mean i- i'd rather even if a country|user:but um	you know or or is in complete opposition to it at least it's their choice as as long as long it's one that's	1
agent:it i'm i'm really wondering whether that's going it settle down or not because|agent:yeah that was uh|user:like	i mean	1
user:yeah well i mean|agent:are trying to make the country better|user:yeah	i don't mean to well i guess i do in a way sometimes i think a religion has a lot to do with that i think that	0
agent:well they actually understood it is in America where it was hard [laughter] Latin they're you know|agent:yeah|user:the old church yeah which it's not that way now but i think that there is just that i think that it's just Latin countries are slower in coming around	well Latin	1
user:i mean why are they|user:well i mean how can you contrast th[e]- the Europeans and their vocalism on their rights to to say the people in Latin America|agent:i never really thought of in that way	why are they not as vocal or why do they not you know stand up so to speak for their rights	1
agent:you know in education maybe i don't know about education because the black community is still not|agent:i think communication does have a lot to do with it|user:yeah	yeah	1
agent:[laughter]|user:yeah|agent:to think that we're richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer	uh in our country	1
user:they're educating their people to higher degrees than we do so you're going to have to expect it so what you are you willing are you willing to compromise a little|user:you know and yet they yet people get very frightened when they see the Japanese moving in and the the Russians moving in in certain areas of technology you know that we use to dominate and it's like well you know|user:so	and and pay pay some take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education	1

agent:you know|user:[noise]|agent:uh would sleep on my chest	yeah	1
agent:i'll be one morning and you know the first thing you do is you get up and you you you you you you you feed this cat someth[ing]- something and and you make sure that it can get to its litterbox well|agent:yes well i had th[at]- that [vocalized-noise] cat that i mentioned|agent:really	uh-huh	1
user:uh she wasn't she was dying and uh suggested that i take her to a working ho[spital]- dog hospital animal hospital|user:and uh she stayed there for one day and the doctor called me up and said uh she had a low white cell count and that|user:and and uh she wasn't able to jump she you know lost all her activity	so i took his suggestion and i	0
user:and she had the cat there for two days|user:the cat got sick so she took the cat to the vet|agent:[laughter]	and then the cat died	0
agent:only work initially|user:uh pleasant experience for them uh i think tha[t]- they enjoy that|user:yeah i[t]- i think it will because they're both in their in their seventies and uh the cat uh although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes turned out it turns out to be a	yeah	1
agent:do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote|agent:okay well um|user:okay	i think it's somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference and they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore because they feel like so many of the politicians are	0
agent:and how they were just giving away their marijuana giving away their heroin and what have you to get them started|agent:i know i i spent thirty four years in education here in the Dayton area and in nineteen fifty one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school|agent:but uh	um	1
user:the top neighborhood if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that you know|user:maybe they could give something like uh|user:we're going to go vote like	i mean it doesn't have to be it could be like a a sign that they would put down at the end of your block	0
user:he needs your vote just like he needs everybody elses you know|agent:that is|user:then uh and the importance of it because okay if you don't vote for your friend over here well your friend's not going to have a chance	maybe if they were brought up that a way like you said it would	0
agent:and that maybe maybe to think twice about voting|agent:that their going to have to do what someone else says even though they didn't vote for it|agent:that's right and i think you know that's an excellent idea they for them to realize that	yeah	1

agent:uh that's probably why i've come to that to that way of thinking of course the uh the very emotional uh thinking over what happened to President Reagan you know the guy that got it was mentally deranged since you get one so easily|agent:so uh the violent uh there is not as many people getting killed in robberies and holdups and things like that as you see here|user:that's right	um-hum	1
agent:yeah and and that requires some that would be at the federal level and require some waiting period presumably uh during that waiting period there would be a background uh uh check that would take place|user:i didn't know about that|user:yeah	uh-huh	1
agent:and uh i was just looking around and and the majority of what they've got in there are guns|agent:we you know i wonder i had occasion to go into a pawnshop recently i've never been in one in my life before|user:and you don't have to do any background checking i mean any they would sell it to anybody	uh-huh	1

agent:they're always up where they don't where they're not supposed to be|user:oh no oh no|agent:where i put things if the cats will will jump up on things and knock things over all the time	[noise]	0
user:um-hum [laughter]|user:um-hum|agent:it's like a major production trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while you're gone	that's right that is hard	1
agent:i was eleven or twelve i think when we first got|agent:but that that was my first real experience w[ith]- with with a puppy when when we had our family dog growing up|user:oh okay [noise] oh no bless your heart	[noise] um-hum	1
agent:that they think is good they'll get into the trash an[d]- then it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it and how how tight you have the lid down on it they'll get into it|user:um-hum|agent:my cats do that it if i throw anything away that's any kind of meat or anything like that anything that	[laughter]	1
user:i've uh changed wi[per]- wiper blades or something but|agent:um-hum|user:well Wayne i've never done any uh auto repairs myself at all i mean i may have screwed in a little [laughter] screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something but uh i personally haven't done anything maybe	i have noticed since uh	0
user:and so he priced around and|agent:[laughter]|agent:um-hum	everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it so he thought well i can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars which he did	0
agent:yeah it's like i had the muffler go out on my on my car shortly before it was required to go in Maryland they have uh emission tests|agent:and uh|agent:and uh then spring time i usually end up giving them_1 uh a uh a tune-up and make sure that they're running well	um-hum	1
user:generally i think he|user:so he gets some satisfaction out of that although|agent:yeah	he does not	0
agent:and it's very very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust i only have one guy that i know that i trust to work on my car|user:no|agent:that kind of a situation to come up	um-hum	1
user:but we saw a commercial for like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change he said|user:he had looked at it himself and|user:once the muffler needed to be changed and uh	that's really really good so he went in and uh but when	0
user:and he thought that turned out pretty good because it you know it helped him to understand|agent:yeah|user:have uh you know something that they did together	and be functional now	0
user:um|user:that's willing to do it i go ahead and let them do it i don't feel the need to|user:but that i have enough [laughter-responsibility] that if i have someone like my father when i was living at home and my husband	you know	0
agent:it was something di[fferent]- a little different|agent:i mean she'd always assisted me and done some other things but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was uh|user:hum	it's a good experience it helps you feel i think comfortable with your car and feel like	0
agent:and so he went and got his manager and the manager came out and says i'll give you the parts at cost i'll give you the labor for a hundred dollars and so for two hundred fifty dollars we'll do it all for you [laughter]|agent:you know because i didn't authorize anything|user:um-hum	oh really	1
user:well i|agent:i don't know i don't have much trust in those people but how about your experiences|user:gee	generally try to find my own personal car mechanics	1
user:that needed replacing|user:fuel pump|user:[noise] uh	and that's all the major problems i've had for a vehicle that's got eighty nine thousand miles	1
user:then the other problem too is just a fuel filter and the fuel pump|user:but|agent:yeah	and i've had to replace a set of tires a couple times	0
agent:hum|user:and uh that happened to me twice before i caught on well enough to wh[at]- what happened|user:yeah because it causes an unevenness in the rubber	i had uh	0
user:yeah|agent:it's just it probably costs me at least six seven eight dollars to do it myself i figure for an extra ten dollars let them take [laughter-care] of it|agent:yeah i do that myself i mean i- i take it for places so because_1 i figure for for eighteen dollars they'll mess with the oil and they'll mess with getting the things off and all that you know and	you're you're saving about uh ten bucks by doing it yourself but	1
agent:we had to tow it home and uh and all that and it was like good grief and the car was new at that point it was only like a year or so old|agent:it just totally disengaged itself and you know of course then we had no way of of doing anything at that point|agent:[laughter]	um-hum	1
user:the belts|agent:there's some belts that needed to be tightened|user:now what was it	um-hum	1
agent:that's all i got to say [laughter]|agent:oh well|user:um-hum	yeah i	0
agent:[noise] right|agent:yeah|user:yeah their very corrupt like the Pan[amanians]- Panamanians are were very corrupt	the thing about it is like the Panamanians is a lot of servicemen down there a lot of a lot even our American servicemen are involved	0
user:soldiers are there but there's a lot|user:and there's a lot of Amer[ican]- i don't know how many American uh|agent:uh-huh	i mean they uh	0
agent:um-hum|user:National Geographic and i don't know i don't think they have any more money than any of the other countries|agent:i know	they don't have oil or anything and they don't have big tourism	0
agent:i don't think there are the little box is black on the top of the pyramid of the sun it's black so yeah you can't really tell but it is kind of weird you know you think wow there is where they did human sacrifices to false Gods and|agent:[noise]|user:yeah is is there still blood stains on the altar or has it worn away all through the years	is it	1
user:coming from that background what we pretty much do is we our household as far as living expenses we live on a cash budget|agent:um okay|user:you know keyed in on expenses and things like that [laughter-so] um	every month my husband uh goes to the credit union and withdraws	0
agent:uh-huh|user:but uh we've gotten pretty good at it we've been doing it for a couple of years now|agent:[laughter]	so we our budgets are realistic and they are not	0
user:most of our medical things we don't|user:well uh|user:right	uh have to worry about because of insurance and	0
agent:or like what what percent do you then save or something|user:in our|user:well	uh we have a lot of different things right now we save about twenty five percent	0
agent:you know so it isn't any extended uh it may be that i picked up something at the uh store but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then so it's not any you know uh build up on the charge cards at all|agent:standard we usually don't or if it it is a purchase uh then it's paid off when the bill comes|user:uh-huh	right that's good	1
agent:uh-huh|user:four hundred dollars for the month let's say|user:i don't even remember what it is now	and um mean some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else and	0
user:like i said if we don't have we we also set aside money for entertainment i mean it's|user:the cash budget just fits right in there and [laughter]|user:uh	but again it's a set amount every month	0
agent:[laughter]|user:sure i know|agent:your priority at least mine is to save for the house but then it's awful hard to really scrimp for a long long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment you feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime	that's how i feel about sometimes about my kids' education	0
agent:oh|user:self down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work|user:some things my husband cut him	and that's all he has he has a ten dollar bill	1

agent:that's where you problem comes in is because some people will work for nothing when other people won't|agent:for nothing|user:for nothing and uh	yeah	1
agent:because everybody's not free to do what they want to do in every country|agent:you know like the government should i say|agent:the country themselves	b[ut]- but do you think do you think that's why there's so many people that want to come to the United States because_1 of freedom or	1

agent:he run across a man's file that was like on death row for nine years before they finally got around to executing him|agent:i think that you know of the the uh|user:loo[k]- i mean that has to be one of the biggest wasters of money is the years that these guys sit on death row i mean	[laughter-oh] [laughter-no]	0

user:drugs or whatever else um|user:and whoever that may be whether it's a robbery or|user:uh been a major offense but uh uh even the {piddly} little stuff i mean the the guys that loses today in America is the victim	they are the ones that are going to pay	0
agent:they're not going to worry about it because they're going to be packing their own heat and they're going to take care of business themselves|agent:get to such an extent where the average American citizen if they see a crime go down or a crime is happening against them they're not going to worry about trying to get a policeman|agent:things are going to come to a point it's going to probably	right	0
user:it['s]- it's wrong your right [laughter] um i|user:uh it's|user:you know several other things the dogs like they would just kill the dogs you know so	it it seems unfortunate and a little frustrating because it seems like we have citizens the there isn't much we can do um	0

agent:then i'm not sure that it's the right thing it's there i think we have too much too many social programs|agent:uh if what we wind up with is more socialistic than what we have now|agent:somewhere in the middle would even be desirable because uh i mean if there's if there's something	um-hum	1
user:but that's an interesting uh|user:so|agent:right oh i	merging as it were of the two ideas we're going one way and they're going the other	1

agent:it's hard to make it on one income but we did and and we lived in a trailer for eighteen years|agent:well see whenever my Mom stayed home with us we did without a lot i mean we were|user:absolutely and uh acting out because that is the way of getting attention	that's right	1
user:right and uh while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child's in the elementary school and they get into the high schools so often they seem to drop away at that point|agent:it's way too late i agree|agent:it is	and that is just as valuable	0
user:yes and i had to deal with their problems and i could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had|agent:hearing it from other students|agent:well i guess that was good that you were you were	just in general aspect and our son would share this and then he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of of uh lines	0
EMPTY	[noise] well Stephanie what's your position on gun control	1
user:where i don't think you sh[ould]- should necessarily ban guns any by any means but you should definitely have the the character search and they the seven day holding period and things along that nature|agent:uh-huh|user:the like three	uh you know you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one and	1
user:and maybe they just don't report those or i'm not sure or you know i can't think of|agent:um i|user:being foiled or spoiled because the person who's being robbed had a gun	ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed but good thing they had their gun on them and they	0
agent:and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere [laughter]|user:um-hum|agent:uh with these guns and my really my only ex[perience]- experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right	oh jeez	1
user:a uh a handgun|user:you know [vocalized-noise] if they had to have a rifle or was y[ou]- you know made it more difficult to get a|agent:yeah	now of course you know in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want	1

agent:um|user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh	well that's good	1

user:that if you take someone else's life then you automatically are giving up|user:is uh it kind of depends on the crime that's committed my belief all my life i guess has been that|user:have capital punishment for certain crimes and that's probably the way i feel about it is	uh yours in place of it	0
agent:oh is that|user:but i lean towards if it's premeditated or if it's|user:uh there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for	uh	1
agent:oh yeah|user:are really pretty slim right now and you can probably spend|user:no it's not you think of your chances of getting the death penalty after [cre/committing] uh committing a crime	uh a lot of time	0
user:right|agent:also indirectly by that indirect involvement it's just it's it's ridiculous|agent:uh indirectly of the crime but	sh[e]-	1

user:so he did away with that and then he went to the bank|user:so that they cut that out so they they couldn't have a lien on his house anymore|agent:yeah	because_1 the bank gave him apparently some extra credit because they had that lien	1
user:so they ended up both being in court in front of the judge pleading their case|user:Leland was going to try a motion make a motion before that|user:um	and um	1
agent:uh-huh|user:and he was going to put it in the hands of a businessman to to run it and see if the firm was salvageable or not|user:and the judge wouldn't do it but he said he he's going to give a like a ten day uh evaluation	and and both parties had to come up with with lists of people that were suitable to to run it	1

agent:what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases and it's|user:yeah|agent:and everything else and uh	tha[t's]- that's that's it a lot of the time i- i was stationed in in Turkey for for a year and a half	0
user:yeah|agent:absolutely|user:yeah	i uh	1

user:um|agent:i see|user:you know industrial engineering	and he's from the Philippines	0
user:i don't know it's to me it's amazing i don't know what we're going to do as a country|user:and [laughter]|agent:that's right	we're we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later	1
user:well|agent:um-hum|user:read in the paper just last week IBM's unveiling their new laptop computer	at a price tag of six thousand bucks i don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers	0
user:um-hum it's already outdated|agent:the way the high tech market goes by the time you can get get something in your hands um it it's it's obsolete and uh|agent:yeah the the unfortunately the way the	yeah	1
agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	uh are you big into lawn and garden work	1
user:uh|user:and uh one of the things that uh we did|agent:right right	just we sort of made a little garden that uh surrounded the trees	0
agent:um-hum|agent:uh-huh|agent:huh	and for the back i would uh	0
agent:so i'm just thinking how in the world i was going to have to scrape up all those uh acorns that are sitting out there they even have some little trees growing because they just left them the acorns i guess sit|agent:uh|agent:and um so	um-hum	1
agent:and uh i hadn't really wanted to get that many you know to put out there i i much prefer flowers|agent:i don't know|user:yeah	well my wife got carried away this past year	0
user:one lives in Connecticut and a couple lives in Pittsburgh and one lives near DC|user:so the rest live in|agent:oh well that'll be nice though	so uh	1

agent:uh-huh|user:and trying to sell it to farmers for bedding for their animals|user:they try to do the uh newspapers and uh they had to close their area down because_1 they couldn't sell it they were what they were doing was shredding it	that type of thing and that didn't work but but somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did	0
agent:uh-huh|user:uh mainly the glass the aluminum the plastics|agent:just particular things or	uh	1
agent:know all of them_1 but|agent:couldn't even tell you about i don't|agent:well our company does some things all of which i	and what is TI	1
agent:even some of those can have plastic tabs on them so it's it's hard to kind of figure out|user:oh really|agent:like white they'll take colored folders and and uh	hum	1
agent:and they have initiated a newspaper recycling|user:um-hum|agent:but in our uh city well i live in a suburb of Dallas	um-hum	1
user:yeah|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:yeah they were taken over by Glass Containers years ago and but he worked for them for like thirty one years	oh for heaven's sake	1
user:and uh we we just we just don't want it anyplace [laughter] we feel that we|agent:um|user:that feed the Clarion Ri[ver]- River	that they should give businesses more incentives	1
agent:cost to them because obviously no one wants to spend a lot of money|user:um-hum um-hum|agent:um better for companies to do these things get involved in it without huge	right	0
agent:i uh that's their marketing|user:no but they think and probably the right people buy it|user:hum-um hum-um	[vocalized-noise] yeah	0
user:uh various other|agent:uh-huh|user:like the Conservation Corps back in the thirties or	things of that sort and it seems to me that it's it's not a totally bad idea but i don't quite see how they'd make it work	1
agent:uh-huh|user:there is uh justification for taking everybody if you take anybody|user:and i suppose that	but i just really think that the difficulties involved in	0
agent:it you know to think of others|agent:and i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me it taught me not to be so self-centered and|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:be able to take care of them [laughter] so that's yeah so that may not may not benefit them in the long run|user:that's true [laughter] good point|agent:right especially in you know if you take a a child that's from the inner city and then put them in the a middle of a park if they go back to the inner city they may not see trees for a while much less	[laughter] [laughter]	0
user:finding out this particular pers[on]- from this particular person|user:it detailed how this one person went about|user:yeah uh the special on channel thirteen that was broadcast i think last week or so ago	his home mortgage how much he pays for it what his payments are	0
agent:you don't really have any privacy at all|agent:that's all fine and good but|user:yeah	not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody i s[uppose]- suppose because it you can easily be overheard overheard	0
agent:yeah|user:it's i suppose it depends on who you're working for and where at|user:out there	but um	1
user:the computer is the|user:record or|agent:yes	the big advent of that i believe because	1
user:uh the only way it can change is um|agent:what do you think could be done about it|agent:hm	if if everybody bands together it's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that's serving in the office	1
user:we're we're able to|user:i suppose country insofar as|user:i don't know it's it's still a a free	obtain information and	1
agent:and companies are paying them good money to report accurately and they're not they're so lazy they're just not doing it i mean they just find your name and they match it up|user:um|agent:they don't they don't even check my social security number	um-hum	1
user:yeah [laughter] i|agent:not that i can think of|user:any other problems	i guess i've just about run out of	1

agent:yeah|agent:uh-huh|user:been better or i- i- s[ay]- say cousin's like my grandmother's [laughter-cousin] but i had been really close to her	and in some ways i think for her might have even been better because_1 she used to live in	0
agent:and h[is]- like his other par[ents]- grandparents on his other side both were in a nursing home and his grand[mother]- his other g[randmother]- his dad's mother finally went into a coma and she was in a coma for almost two years in a nursing before before she passed away and that that was awful|agent:and uh|user:uh-huh	uh-huh well i'm sure	1
agent:an[d]- and and what i would you would really consider a rural area an[d]- where there's like one nursing home per town|user:uh-huh|agent:well that yes tha[t]- that's true uh but um they're in a smaller small area and our an[d]- in fact they're over up in Missouri an[d]- an[d]-	no so you probably don't have too much choice	1
agent:i know|user:but you know when i see them i don't know that i could [vocalized-noise] when i think of my parents who fortunately shouldn't be close to getting there yet but i don't|agent:oh i couldn't do it i just absolutely couldn't do it [vocalized-noise]	[vocalized-noise] think of	1

agent:oh that'd be awful i love going out in the Summer in the grass|user:but that's because i'm allergic to the grass|agent:uh-huh	really	0
agent:[laughter-yeah]|agent:[laughter]|user:one good thing about it see i don't have to mow the grass or [laughter] i mean that's really [laughter-nice]	but	1
agent:uh-huh|user:and i mean just pulling them_1 as fast as you can we usually give them to everybody anybody that wants a cucumber can have it but|agent:holy smoke	we tried it too where you run it up a fence	1
user:and it was weird but the birds had you know evidently just|agent:[laughter-yeah]|agent:uh-huh	deposited them for us	1
user:and uh then you get into|user:uh the whole defense industry's had some problems in that realm even the CEO's tend to steal a little of that here and there|user:things where people tend to steal a little time at work or steal a few supplies or	whole areas of crime like drug usage and organized crime and	1
user:Soviet uh|user:there was another uh angle that i- i started seeing as uh the Polish situation and some of the|agent:corrected to to some extent	countries as it were uh they started coming into the news and you started hearing about some of their	1
agent:become a an engine for [laughter-crime] here lately|agent:thing is really uh|agent:that'd explain a lot of it and then uh i guess the drug	yeah that's true i mean it feeds upon itself	0
user:high schoolers that are coming out of school why even for the past two to three years|user:becoming depressed economically and to see that the|user:the portions of the S[tates]- United States that are	uh there's nothing for them_1 you know uh a lot of these rural areas college wasn't even a a consideration for the majority of them_1 they kind of are confident that they could just move right on into	0
user:i've got a a brother-in-law that's on the police force and|user:the crimes of that age group i guess|user:that's not going to do anything but spread as as uh economic hardships spread and so will the	and his uh	1
user:yeah and they|agent:supper topic [laughter-there]|user:grim family yeah	fortunately they have some some success stories to share and i try to	0
agent:okay Greg|user:see if we get together again sometime|agent:yeah	nice talking to you	0
user:would you see TI just started that policy uh the[y]- they have a random uh drug testing policy|agent:me to come in and be tested you know what i mean|agent:i might be offended if they asked	and uh	0
user:uh but uh the way they have it set up or the way i understand is that they want everyone|agent:[noise]|user:but in uh a year's time you might be called up i don't know twice or three times and nobody called up any	they've got it set up where	0
user:i'm i'm all for it because uh|user:but|agent:we[ll]- how do you feel about that	you know uh i want a a drug free environment i don't want a uh even though i do work in th[e]- the office i'm uh a financial analyst	1
user:to me they're still under under the influence if it's in their body and uh|user:well that's that's true an[d]- and|agent:what if they did it though on their own time and it's still [vocalized-noise] it stays in your body for such a long time	i don't know i- that's i have a strong feeling that i'm	0
user:and uh if that one comes back positive [noise]|user:then they automatically uh test you again|user:liberal they if you're tested positive	then they send you to a uh	0
user:i don't know cleaned your act up or whatever then|agent:uh-huh|user:on a weekly basis you have to go in and take a test for and this goes on for several months and uh if they if you can prove to them_1 that you've	then uh they won't terminate you but any any time during that time if they do uh if you do test positive then uh it's automatic termination	1
user:i think|user:i don't know i [vocalized-noise]|user:and uh	any more that uh drugs are so prevalent you know in our society that that uh	0
user:right|user:i see|agent:well i've got an eleven year old son and an eight year old daughter and my son says i don't understand this drug stuff why don't people understand all you have to do is say no you know and he doesn't realize the pressure that he's going to be under later when his friends start doing this	exactly or uh uh an older peer will come up to him an[d]- and uh try to try to get him hooked on it so that he'll start selling it or something you know	0
user:golly that is terrible|agent:and the teacher started talking to them_1 and they said that they were selling drugs out of ice cream trucks now|agent:and all these little first graders were always drawing these pictures of ice cream trucks	but i mean that makes sense because_1 uh that's where all the uh the kids are you know you have the easy access to them_1	0
user:there'd be some very profitable businesses|user:do half as good as they do then uh|user:if uh if other businesses could	but unfortunately they prey on prey on the young kids	1
agent:some jobs it seems like it would just maybe be a waste of money because_1 who cares you [laughter-know]|agent:[noise] i don't know|user:that everyone should be tested what do you think	right	1
agent:especially since we're going to cut [vocalized-noise]|user:you know i guess the only fear i would have would be that uh you know|user:right	if i had a child uh that one in a million first grade teachers that would be on drugs my child would be in their class	0
user:i i'm i'm living in [noise] just west of Baltimore and uh|user:um [noise]|user:okay yeah it's uh	[noise] Frederick um which is also just west of Baltimore has a minor league team and uh	0

user:oh he has|agent:really i mean he really has become a a very decent fielder|user:[laughter] i mean he you know he can't field and you know he strikes out a lot but i mean he's done that for five years why get rid of him now [laughter]	okay i hadn't	1
user:um [noise] and uh that guy Offerman the short stop|agent:yeah|user:um okay you know who he is then	is gonna be good	1
user:oh [noise]|agent:boy you are a baseball fan aren't you|user:you know saw you know saw the Cardinals and Cubs last year and a bunch of teams the year before	uh yeah [laughter]	1

agent:[laughter]|user:oh yeah|agent:[noise] and actually i've started working up there in the afternoons too so	well that's neat	1
agent:and uh we really seem to be pleased with her and um|user:yeah|agent:how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and stuff like that	did you did you introduce your daughter to her before you made your decision	1
agent:and then they almost all of them_1 had a Montessori section|agent:they did a lot of play work and stuff|agent:or interviewed at um	huh	1
agent:[laughter] exactly exact[ly]- i wanted to quit my job so i could stay home with her the next five months because i know she's going to have to face [laughter-that]|user:no especially when going to spend the next eighteen years in [laughter-school]|agent:the whole time but	[laughter]	1
user:because_1|agent:yeah i wa[s]- i was petrified|agent:that's scary	i know	1
user:yeah|agent:you [laughter-know] when their parents come and it's hard to get them out and a lot of parents have places to go and|user:uh-huh	[laughter]	1
agent:you know go in and get one|agent:or if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could|user:uh-huh	ye[ah]- yep that's right or you know in a a car accident	1
user:yeah yep|agent:you know dr[ugs]- drugs and everything else and|user:i would be too	yeah	1
agent:stuff those kids getting snatched and|agent:terrifies me to death and|user:oh i can see it too	uh-huh	1
agent:i don't think we have one|user:so what do you what's your opinion on the our policy down there|user:[noise]	i didn't know we had one either [laughter]	1
agent:especially after our friend Jimmy Carter gave it away anyway|user:yeah that is that is pretty uh risky|agent:i'm just kind of surprised we did that	i mean	1
user:we're against them i don't think we can go into another country|user:well i don't think it's possible because even though you know|agent:i'd be interested to see if we do that	and do something about the other country's problem	1
agent:i think you need to pick that up and read it it's quite uh it's it's quite interesting it addresses the problem|user:uh no i didn't|agent:did you read Tom Clancy's A Clear and Present Danger	oh the drug problem	0
user:i think i think the big thing is trying to stop here on the home front|user:the drugs i think|user:with the Panama and and with the C[entral]- Cent[ral]- you know Middle East problems things that that are more important take precedent precedence over	and bef[ore]- you know it it'll take a little bit of time before they'll realize that this is failing so they're going to have to go to the source	1
agent:considering the Kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway|user:probably|agent:i would not be surprised if the Kennedy Foundation or some of those don't have a lot of uh financial holdings in in Central and South America	[laughter]	1
user:and they'll just pick|user:right|agent:if you give everybody what they wanted there [vocalized-noise] is a complete democracy those people wouldn't know how to react because they have no education	crooked people again	1

agent:so but yeah that one is definitely worth seeing it's really good|agent:uh they pushed it back to August|agent:i think because they were they were scheduling a video release of it in July and then when it won all those awards	now did you see uh Driving Miss Daisy	1

user:yeah|user:oh [laughter]|agent:and uh my sister sewed and she needed the money so i would pay her and she'd make my clothes [laughter] and uh and then just in the last you know ten or twe[nty]- i just haven't sewn anything i would love to i would like to get back to it	uh-huh	0
agent:well do you have kids and a husband are you sewing for a whole family or|agent:good night|user:six seven and then you get into the vogues they get up t[o]- into twelve and fifteen and on like that	uh right now i'm just sewing for myself i i do have two daughters that you know out they're they're grown now though	0
user:i know a lot of people where i work make their clothes it's just|user:right|agent:you know you have to have something that kind of gets you on the right track of where you're going	there's just so many people sewing now days	1
agent:and i started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that i was dating at the time|user:oh|agent:so she did and i crocheted a blanket for my sister's baby	uh-huh	1
agent:sure|user:well you know in when we used to sew we'd sew the seam and then we'd finish the edges|agent:i don't think so	and we we would uh trim the seams and finish the edges	0
agent:for the machine yeah|user:pretty expensive i like i paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine|user:they're	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:so it's here but i haven't touched one like since college so i kind of am picking it all out again and trying to remember how to do it again and of course my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on it and i'd love to teach them to play too|agent:uh they sail and so they sold their home and they they've been sailing and uh	yeah	1
agent:i try to save that for the weekend i need to get better at it though [laughter]|agent:so|user:right	uh-huh	0
user:yeah i i like sewing sewing up the garment itself i really like to do that but the the cutting and the|agent:yeah|user:yeah that that's that's the part that i don't like too	all the even the cutting i don't like	1
user:and uh|agent:uh-huh|user:and it's the loopers that form the the edge you know that edge finish	that's what really makes it look professional	0
user:no it's it's a it's a|agent:like an attachment or|user:it's uh	it's a machine it's not exactly a sewing machine but it doe[s]- it does sew the seam and trim the edges and all that stuff but there are oth[er]- are other things that	0
agent:his crime was not considered a capital crime|agent:um|agent:yet for whatever reason	uh-huh	1
agent:that's that's right|user:bills on the credit card or the {shopaholic} you know you get your life right with God but you still have to pay your Visa bill you still have to|user:you know you're found to be guilty i believe God establishes the authority of our court system and i believe that you know that i do believe that capital punishment is uh alternative even you know God can still change your heart but that doesn't mean like the alcoholic that charges up all the	you know so but God sent us his grace and they give pardons but i believe if it's a genuine conversion there's a genuine and those prison people know they know a genuine	0
agent:we don't have a speedy trial we don't have speedy um punishment and so it kind of loses its meaning if you sit on death row for months and years|user:right but in in the Old Test[ament]-|agent:as the trial was over then it was stoning	yeah	1
user:you know what i mean it's like looking beyond what they're doing|user:but you know it's like God changes your heart to not do that he changes your heart not to look upon a woman in lust because in the Old Testament they could look all they wanted just couldn't do it but in the new he's looking at your heart and so i guess that's what what i mean by their character changes and|user:yeah under the law he would be stoned so we've been removed from the law of un[der]- from being under the law but we're still you know we're still accountable to it we don't need to back talk	and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart what's the character	0
user:unless there's a true change of character and that's where we just have to to trust the authorities and they're not going to excuse people if it was was run like that i don't there would probably be very few exceptions to|user:sexual crimes|agent:i tend to agree on that very strongly	that and if it was done quickly and done swiftly and	0
agent:and sentenced to to death that that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly|user:uh-huh [noise]|agent:convicted	uh-hum	0
user:my husband's going Singapore and they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law and the law is enforced and that's what|user:Singapore is it like that|user:and they	wh[at]- when you have lawlessness	0
user:it was set up with God and it was really an integral part and no you can't|user:in the court system and i think initially when our country was set up|user:there's no the answer is not being given to them	you can't force people but i think people are hurting and they're out doing crack sitting on the street they were the kind of people that	0
agent:when people go so far out to the extreme on either side|user:yeah|user:right	yeah	1
agent:uh for world events i'll take CNN any day|user:do you enjoy mainly network news or like CNN|user:uh-huh	[laughter-yeah]	0
user:uh doesn't seem to be um granted i i i read primarily the more controversial topics so i'm sure that it's easier for them to uh|agent:and there's no mid ground anywhere in it|user:that one newspaper is very liberal one of them is very conservative	be you know polarized more so on the top[ic]- on the	0
user:in the forms that we have been attempting it is not realistic|user:well i think that it's been proven since somewhere in the early nineteen hundreds that rehabilitation|user:[laughter]	um	0
user:what a lot of people tend to believe|user:uh which is|user:useless for rehabilitation	happens in a prison	1
agent:concealed or unconcealed i'm all for that|agent:the average citizen to be able to pack his own weapon again|agent:there was a thing recently in the paper there was a bill in front of the state legislature that was going to allow	uh-huh	1
user:i uh|user:yeah|agent:when i went shopping to the malls i would definitely be packing all kind of pow[er]- firepower	i	1
user:um my roommate was attacked and she got away unharmed but scared to pieces and had had all of her clothing ripped off of her|user:in my area|user:danger	um	1
user:just having them take it [laughter] you know i mean that's i that's that's truly how i felt i felt like if i were carrying something and if i actually pulled it on somebody that was trying to attack me|user:like carrying one would be a benefit to me rather than|user:to to carry one or to feel	that their chances of getting it from me would be higher than my chances of using it effectively on them	1
user:oh i feel that is certainly if you're going to carry one you need to be uh|user:uh-huh|agent:th[at]- that or any side arm whether it be a blade or whether it be a handgun or whatever	very comfortable with the piece	0
user:but|user:you know the criminal ends up getting the gun and shooting the people to begin with you know the people that had it in the beginning|user:having firearms or having whatever form of protection they prefer because you know even though the odds is	if the if if you're talking about uh two people if you're talking about a criminal	1
agent:hesitated|agent:they had the time to react but they|agent:cutting them somewhere because they	uh-huh	1
user:uh|user:that would be something that would have to be|user:i agree	evaluated	1
agent:what th[e]- their constituents really want them to do|agent:uh most of the time what the|agent:don't really do	uh-huh	1
user:my husband had worked late and i was going to go we wanted to go together to do it and take our son but it was like we ran in and whew we were the last people in there|user:and we ran in there it was like right at seven and|agent:right	and i thought you know Kyle gets off usually about oh	0
user:there were talking about how the Congress|user:i i- guess i even thought that then this morning so it's funny i got this topic because|user:anyway and i felt like i was listening to Dobson this morning and	it pays the Congress to make	0
user:[laughter]|agent:start over [laughter-again] you know that's we've the people have talked uh you know about hav[ing]- about redoing the Constitution completely or changing the government a little you know to some extent|user:i know [laughter] now come on	uh-huh	1
user:even though um the mother really would given approval|user:but it you couldn't do that even through the state even the mo[ther]- it wasn't through the state but|agent:uh-huh	but because of the situation we just didn't think it was	0
agent:it's the rest of it huh you know the|user:[noise] right [noise] our society is so messed up though it's like no wonder they interpret it wrong we were in Dallas last night and we ate dinner at|agent:yeah i guess th[e]- the Constitution is not the part that needs to be changed it's the	Meadow Road and seventy five at a restaurant there	0
agent:um|user:and um she was just so friendly and i asked the manager as we checked out i said is that lady a ballerina or what and he goes he said no she's a [laughter-bulimic]|agent:uh-huh	because she was so skinny	0
user:we live in Euless now we don't see that in Euless too much but|agent:i'm going to have to start going out to eat more often i'd i guess i would like to see [laughter-some] [laughter-things] [laughter-like] [laughter-that]|agent:that's	you know that's what it i mean it was just absolutely maybe it was just that night right	0
user:course we're in a good position they're|agent:no i- i just think that|user:not yet	they're quite dependent on us right now	0
user:i i think their|user:i think i think they're in pretty bad shape right now|user:and communists have their own little ideology about the way things are going to be	i think their reliance on us is is probably real	1
user:well it's going to be interesting in the next few years to see what happens because_1 there's quite a strong democratic|user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh	um	0
user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter] that's true|user:couple of Russians walk in and look at it and say well we have the worst of both worlds communism and capitalism	but you know i i i think that	0
user:[laughter-but]|agent:uh-huh|user:they talk about unification unification and now they're unified and now all they can do is gripe [laughter]	oh well i don't know	1
user:um|agent:yeah|user:there has been a lot more openness	we can only hope that that continues	1
agent:as as much ability to to do harm to us as anyone|agent:that have|agent:things to the the other countries	uh-huh	1
EMPTY	[noise]	0
user:uh-huh|agent:it's run down and beat up but it could be fixed up and used and it's just you know sitting there wasting away|user:yeah	yeah we're not too far behind i graduated in seventy one so i'm i'm	0
user:it's just that|agent:uh-huh|user:uh a lot of reasons for that not not just because i'm a i'm a hard ass or anything	like you say kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're going to do	1
agent:and uh you know it's there's there's a heck of a lot of difference between you know the intake that you get from TV and and movies and what you hear in school and then what reality is|user:oh yeah|agent:a lot of it has to do from too much TV	yeah	1
user:you know why isn't somebody stepping in and and sto[p]- putting a stop to this|user:where are the parents in all of this|user:you wonder	kids in high school are just too young to be married	1
user:uh-huh|agent:other people really live and know how bad off some people really are and how good they've got it|agent:yeah i think once once kids get out and see how	yeah	1
user:you know they need help they don't have anybody to depend on and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house or do minor repairs or something like that|user:you know they|agent:uh-huh exactly	and	1
user:you know like the like the yard work and little repairs and|user:i i'm not i'm not saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway but it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things|user:and uh	painting and stuff like that	1
agent:to do everything|user:yeah|agent:you know the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other out instead of counting on government	well that's that's the that's the point we've gotten to you know every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government	0
agent:yeah|user:i uh in a way i think it's a little bit inefficient but but it's better than nothing|user:and that was kind that was kind of neat	and and at least i had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing	1
user:under welfare|user:and we took all the benefits that a family that a a married couple with two kids would get|user:uh we did a uh a cost comparison in one of my courses	and what they would be making at minimum wage and they came out four thousand dollars better a year	0
agent:both|agent:um|user:what do they what do they do in Maryland do they use highway people or do they use prisoners	yeah tha[t]- that's the way they did it in Alabama too	0
user:uh they're they're|user:what do i say uh|user:i think um well i guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation i think your generation is um	they're polite they have more respect for other people just in in general i think	0
user:uh-huh|agent:to me also our nuclear family is is not the same because more people are living together that aren't married uh|agent:economically has not been like it used to be	uh-huh	1
agent:i guess that's why you always hear these stories about kids being neglected|agent:and uh|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
user:um in the morals and values of like my generation for the most for most people are totally different|user:i i think well|user:like	from the morals and valleys um values of like	0
agent:do you watch LA Law|user:i don't know because i know i don't watch while i'm up here at school i don't watch hardly any TV like Thursday night i like to sit down and watch a few shows but other than that|agent:i don't know if it really hampers or it helps our education system	no i don't watch that [laughter] i used to but i don't any more	0
agent:um|user:and um yesterday she was at the kindergarten and there's this little boy he like didn't want to do anything and he said i'm not doing this i don't like it and he sat at his desk with two pencils in his hand and pretend like he's playing Nintendo|user:but then um like i know this girl she's doing her student teaching or she's just working like within the school	you know so	1
agent:um|user:um|agent:is there anything else	what about in our work ethics	1
agent:[noise]|user:[noise] uh [noise] several years ago my very best friend moved to back to Grand Island Nebraska and we had ridden bicycles	and it was bothering my knees that spring and we have lots of wind in Indiana and i thought oh shoot i'll just walk to town	0
agent:oh i don't blame you walking is uh you know it's interesting because|user:and i guess i'd have to say it's a part of both of our lives and we just recommend it to anyone who'll listen to us|user:has also started walking with me	[laughter]	1
agent:uh-huh well you see now that's what i do and um but tha[t]- that's just about enough and uh uh uh i mean not that i wouldn't like to walk more but uh um i've i am a widow so uh and i have a handicapped son so i have to|user:at least two|user:um-hum	um-hum	1

agent:and i just i mean that even when i read it now it still makes me cry the ending of it|user:uh-huh|agent:i think it was because i read um Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities	[laughter]	1
user:a lot of the things like you might find at uh|user:books out now that are kind of [laughter-garbage] books and i well i don't prefer to read|user:i think that there's a lot of	well like at a Target or a	0
user:and those are really helpful i think in helping um|user:or how to how to do something books you know for reference and uh|agent:um-hum	well you know like some	0
user:for reading|user:and um so i tend to|user:and i do enjoy those quite a bit	just day to day uh you know i have a particular book i'm looking for or i just enjoy uh you know the newspaper magazine	1
agent:later on those books|user:right|agent:the plots or anything	well i think that's good because	0
user:to read books and|user:not too much well that's right well i think it is good to|agent:no	and [noise] because even if it's like you say it's light reading you are still getting some	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:oh okay|user:well i i was i'm home now full time	but uh so yeah we're we think books are important around here	0
agent:oh really|user:and we're expecting another one tonight|user:oh we had a frog strangler go sw[eeping]- sweeping through here uh yesterday and last night	oh i mean it was raining so hard you could swim down the street	1
agent:no it's not this is uh about uh ten degrees cooler than usual but about a week ago we were up to eighty and eighty five degrees|user:uh-huh well tell me uh is is it normally that cold up there in the in the Spring|agent:and i grew up in Saint Louis and Saint Louis was much the same	you're kidding	1
agent:we had uh a week ago they had golf ball size hail coming down in one part of the uh of the city of Dayton itself|agent:yes|user:and freezing weather	oh	1
agent:because that could have really been disastrous|agent:oh they that was [vocalized-noise] very very fortunate for them|user:uh uh had just quit rehearsal about a half hour before	oh and how	1
agent:and of course the salt does melt the ice but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes uh a perpetual problem|agent:right well uh well here what they do and i i contend that it's certainly not the right thing to do they spread salt|user:truck of sand and uh uh four or five laborers up there just spreading it by hand	well and then to make matters worse it destroys your vehicles too	1
agent:okay that makes sense then [laughter] i believe|agent:uh okay|user:well she's part Chow and part shepherd	uh-huh but she's the best	0
agent:is that right|agent:[laughter]|user:or better yet down around Saint Petersburg Florida	uh-huh that's what i call home	1
agent:[noise]	okay	1
user:yeah uh well i think one of the reasons uh only fifty percent or so vote in the national|agent:i'm amazed myself sometimes i've got some ideas and they've tried a few things but [vocalized-noise] you first|user:yeah	is uh	1
agent:right|user:could either go before or after work|user:oh they may have two or three hours there that they	but uh	0
user:local elections are concerned [noise] pardon me [noise] i can understand you know why a lot of people don't vote on those because in the first place|user:and as far as local|user:yeah	not many people are are really that knowl[edgeable]- knowledgeable about what the uh	0
user:plus|agent:i don't i don't have an answer for the local elections and why you have ten percent of the people voting that's really so low i'm amazed|user:yeah	yeah plus i think	0
user:plus also i|agent:sacred and and until it's all over|agent:from the polls i would think that ought to be	i'm sure that there's a legitimate reason for it but i don't understand	1
agent:wondered about it but i haven't really got concerned about it one way or another you know|agent:yeah i haven't thought about that much i i've uh|user:yeah	yeah	1
user:uh|user:what the well i guess i do what the pur[pose]- was i started to say what the purpose of the registration is|user:yeah and i'm not i'm not real sure	it seems like to me they could use uh	0

agent:big garage a big basement uh just like my parents house except for on the water [laughter]|user:yeah right|user:um-hum	huh	1
user:the uh public school sys[tem]- system seems to be	getting a lot of uh criticism lately i guess over the years it's always	0
user:begin learning some of the reading and by the second or third grade uh the little school system that we're in|user:your little terms here and and learn how to uh|user:learn your colors learn your alphabet learn all your	they have uh really a lot of computers uh it's a very	0
user:we also managed to land in a school that uh|agent:um-hum|user:pressure on the kids than uh than we had of course of course i guess with that learning comes that pressure	they decided to build one big rectangular building and then not have any walls for the classroom	0
agent:oh goodness|user:thousand fifty right now|user:and our particular schools run uh	so they they put a few more warm bodies in there than the teachers really needed to have they still have a twenty three to twenty five or so to one	0
user:to pick up the kids that's how much of a chunk it takes out of the old day but uh it is better just to let them you know play outside than it is to fight the traffic so|agent:oh that's a good idea|user:and we usually let them play if the weather's nice play outside until the traffic dies down and then we go home so i'm there from two thirty until four o'clock i'm just waiting for	and there's it's real nice park lands on both sides of the school they have you know climbers and stuff like that but	1
agent:so um|user:uh-huh|agent:and even in the past two years it's gotten i mean it's just increased the the crime and the the drugs and the violence and everything have just cr[ime]- increased enormously	well another thing that we've noticed that's uh changed over the years and	0
user:uh third and fourth graders that are|agent:um-hum|user:it seems to be socially acceptable as a self-esteem you know building building the person's confidence up and you have	uh you know when they get into a fight they	0
user:to think about uh they have a name of a particular|user:well what what i would deem the new age thinking where they have these little extra classes but they offer to come in about fifteen to twenty minutes early in the mornings and all the kids will sit around in a little circle and they're they're asked to empty their minds and to|user:and then you get into the whole area of of uh	dinosaur that they	1

agent:no|user:oh yeah i- i think it's a wonderful thing to do and there's a lot there's a lot more i guess another possible solution is since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it|agent:and help them with the language and he thoroughly enjoyed it	uh more of the volunteer network service because_1 everyone gains from it	1

agent:as what we would've paid in state income tax i mean [laughter] probably would have paid the same amount but you know it's not the idea of your paying uh income tax|agent:so i mean it wouldn't have been as painful|agent:i think you know the lottery could have helped	uh-huh	0

agent:what what type of history class is it that you're having to take|user:and i mean it's so boring and i just hate it [laughter] and i think why do they make us take this stuff i mean what does this have to do with getting you know a computer science degree or whatever you know [laughter]|user:i i mean i can relate to that because i'm i'm going to college right now and i feel like i mean i'm taking this history class	uh American History	0
user:any way this this um school system thing i i tell you i saw something on the news oh|user:yeah that's true yeah|agent:the man was not a saint	i don't know maybe [noise] two weeks ago and they were talking about i don't know where you're from but i'm from the Dallas area	0
user:you know and|user:being put in this closet well how is that helping my child|user:well parents were getting really angry [noise] about this because they said why is my child	uh the the thing you know they said well we're giving them isolation time and this helps them to think [laughter]	0
user:i mean either way [laughter]|user:i said now what good does thi[s]- i mean how is this helping|user:but they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms	you know i i definitely had to disagree with that i think that is	1
user:uh-huh|agent:it's going to tax you physically|agent:but	[noise]	0
user:is not just|user:i mean one of the things that can come out of uh|user:i think one of the positive things	di[scipline]- discipline okay but okay for instance one of the things they do at uh my kids school	0
user:positive reinforcement|user:that's|user:when they collect them at the end of each week they get to go to this little what they call their caught being good store and then they get to spend these like money well see to me	is much better	0
user:they they do when they deserve it you know but uh|user:and it really helps and i mean they they don't get spanked very often but|user:really though i mean that's one thing that i mean my kids definitely get spanked when they need they need to be [laughter-spanked] but i really do try to use positive uh reinforcement with them at home also	i don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked [laughter]	0
user:a bit of a system whereby the the natural human greed was able to flourish and some people were able to do some things that|user:the uh whole savings and loan thing seems to be uh	that uh they they felt that that since the government was backing them_1 they could just uh go ahead and make these transactions and make these loans and get all this money as it were	0
agent:you've overbuilt if you're not careful|agent:uh and continue to have this kind of growth indefinitely i mean you you it's it's like anything eventually reach sort of a plateau where|agent:real estate	right	1
user:the news media as it were and|agent:yeah|user:they just had to ride out the storm with the the reputational problems that came with the	uh	0
agent:how's it going to get covered|agent:that's essentially not going to get paid back|agent:the the basic question i'm trying get to is all this bad money	i'm not sure if uh	1
user:okay|agent:there we go uh how many children do you have Jamie	well i have two boys actually they're nine years old and uh five and a half actually almost six now and they're in kindergarten and uh fourth grade how about yourself	1
agent:oh sure|user:you know for hikes or you know going out along the canal area or whatever to ride bikes with them|user:i just got a bike myself because i'm hoping you [laughter-know] eventually maybe	and um you know we enjoy um we enjoy doing more things outdoor playing ball with them my husband likes to play freeze tag with them and and i think as American parents we probably we spend more time than is typical i think uh with the kids and part of that is	0
user:[laughter-yeah]|user:um-hum|agent:oh they are are and and and you know my twenty three year old she's a senior in college and she comes in now and she just loves to pick out the picture book we took a lot of pictures at the time dad do you remember that sixth grade team we had that year dad God we were great weren't we [laughter] [laughter]	that's right i and i really	0

agent:yeah yeah what what what kind of engineering were you in|agent:um-hum|agent:hm	i was a civil engineer	0
user:yeah|agent:read and that's about it [laughter]|agent:my spare time i usually go do aerobics and	yeah i understand that i'm	0
agent:up for other people and things like that but|user:right|agent:like during the Christmas season making them_1	um-hum	1
agent:yeah i don't even kn[ow]- how to knit and my mother used to knit you know all the time and|user:no not at all|agent:it's not like you sit and knit every [laughter-night]	uh-huh	1
agent:and see they do that as their job whereas you know for us i[t]- and they make it cheaper for us to [laughter-buy]|agent:yeah|user:and you know you can go to any like a flea market and stuff and there's just tons of stuff everywhere and you know people just do it in their garage and then on weekends they go out and sell it and during the week they go back and do some more	right [noise]	1
agent:okay i hope you have a good rest of your weekend|user:okay well thank you|agent:yeah [laughter-so]	thanks bye-bye	1

agent:yeah|user:are some of the uh they're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones|user:they're just running out of space and landfills uh Pennsylvania Ohio and New York	so it's really uh it's uh really hard on them now up here in Maryland though we're j[ust]- just in a voluntary recycling stage right now so	0
agent:well they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers and stuff like that but|user:um-hum cans are the only thing i think you really get money for|user:yeah	um-hum	1
user:how much how well they're doing yeah we do i um|user:yeah|agent:it's [laughter-really] i can't believe that you know because_1 they've got it all posted all over the place how much they're saving and how w[ell]- yeah	i i work in a uh speech interface lab	0
user:some|agent:n[o]- i haven't seen anything uh but that doesn't mean that they don't i don't watch much TV but i haven't really seen anything advertised publicly i mean like i said they do a lot of internal advertising on that kind of stuff but i haven't seen anything|user:hopefully if you know i guess a lot of the large organizations probably TI did they advertise on television how successful they are	yeah	1
user:will advertise on television you know they'll jus[t]- come up and say you know they'll show you they'll to encourage|user:yeah because i know that some of the large industries here|user:um-hum	to encourage recycling	0
user:yeah i i think really probably what hit people's you know i know that here in the up in the uh|user:um-hum|user:um-hum	uh the the New England area and also in in Pennsylvania Ohio and New York the just run all of a sudden we're out of landfill	0
agent:well|user:well in some ways i guess it it doesn't become really cost savings until you have an industry around it you know|user:well	because i know that like in Pennsylvania	0
agent:and i mean that kind of surprises me [laughter] i mean you know because once oil gets so you know thick and yucky you'd wonder how they could you know clean that up enough to use it again but they can|user:um-hum|agent:and even i i noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil	yeah	1
user:how terrible that is so we'll have to|user:yeah|agent:yeah i know [laughter]	we'll have to keep our eyes on all that i guess	0

agent:uh-huh|user:it made like a little|user:of the tire	semicircular incision on my plastic bumper	1
user:to this this uh|user:and i got this guy to uh|user:would cost five hundred dollars	company	0
agent:it's the owner or the dealer who sees the big bucks|agent:right well the mechanic doesn't see that you know|user:people people get out of college and work for less than that	yeah	1
agent:oh i should set aside this much money for repairs on cars because you never know it could cost you nothing or it could cost you three times as much|agent:[laughter] that's true that's true i mean it's hard to you know it's hard to say|user:and then all a sudden the music in the background changes and it says but you didn't plan on it breaking down	yeah	1
agent:right|user:i mean i think we pretty much phased out the bus|agent:well i hope so	but i think maybe uh	0

agent:topic like within a certain range of time|agent:and it seems like on everyone's show they have the same|agent:they tend to arrange though the topics seem to go like in a cycle	uh-huh	1
agent:gone over the whole realm of all the different kinds of TV|agent:we seem to have|user:okay uh	[laughter]	1
agent:um-hum|user:should be taping more movies right now|user:my VCR doesn't get an awful lot of use right now but uh	i think next month uh cable's going to have a couple more	0

agent:it's just what do you do for them_1 you want to do something for them_1 but you don't want to get so directly involved that you're occupying the the country|user:it|user:as far as the Kurds are concerned	i	1

agent:i mean i don't know if the Kurdish i know the Shiite's are their people|agent:i'm kind of disappointed with the Iranians why they didn't go s[ave]- save|agent:when we were having the conflict but i i you know it's almost where	um-hum	1

user:i seem to follow every year one is the Dallas Cowboys and|user:there are two basic teams that|user:i don't know i'm not a real great ba[ll]- uh football follower i guess	the other is the Oklahoma Sooners	0
agent:well it's kind of same for me i i grew up in uh southern New Jersey and the local team was Philadelphia and they were like you know thirty miles right up the river|user:and there's always been an interest there|agent:yeah yeah	yeah	1
user:there's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there's there's a chance that maybe uh|user:and i think|user:this past season	uh these guys are right maybe they will come through and and do something this year i look for it to be a pretty good year	1
user:we hope|user:uh|user:who've come through in history that can really perform	every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through	0
agent:yeah|user:and and start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few [vocalized-noise] few minutes|user:or uh if [vocalized-noise] if something happens that that adrenaline really starts flowing they say hey we got to do something now	so	0

user:oh uh that would be a nightmare|agent:with the heartache of first of all getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics|user:[laughter]	and just	0
agent:tha[t]- that would be a part of selling it to the community to the adults ahead of them that probably would never serve and and to each succeeding generation there'd definitely have to be a major|user:uh-huh|agent:i know you've got to get past that that grudge attitude that many have but that's uh	uh-huh	1
agent:there's just been more of a turn toward uh environmental concerns and e[ven]- i work for Texas Instruments and they they've started some|user:uh-huh|agent:uh down here in the last y[ear]- oh year plus i it was las[t]- beginning with last year's Earth Day	uh-huh	1
agent:and as soon as the oil prices came back down we the pendulum swung the other way and we need those reminders|user:uh-huh|agent:we started getting smart and and we were looking all these alternative sources of energy and so forth	right	1
agent:um-hum was it very crowded out there or|agent:uh-huh|user:no no uh it was just for three days we must have done like uh sixty miles or something	no no not at all but uh	0
user:and then we found this little hut a couple of miles down|user:and start walking down the road|agent:yeah	that had you know that sold stuff	0
user:yeah|user:okay|agent:yeah the last the last big camping trip i was on was uh probably a few years after that but it was in the Pagosa Springs area in Colorado a bunch of us uh from here went up there and uh now i got hit by the same thing because we thought we were going to be real mountain men and uh we got up there and we had the little pills you're supposed to put in the water and make sure that it's potable and of course we're up you know up above	yeah	1
user:[laughter]|agent:and then if they wake up and you haven't done everything it's like why haven't you done that but uh well we were drinking you know back to that uh water thing and of course i got sick about the second or third -[un]til the end of the day i'm i'm uproariously sick and i'm in the tent sweating it out|user:yeah	yeah	1
agent:you can throw big tents and food and and stoves and everything in and all you have to do is just you don't even have to if you go downstream you hardly even have to paddle and it's uh|user:yeah|agent:at least with a canoe you don't have to carry everything	yeah	1
agent:yeah yeah that's probably true because uh that's|agent:uh-huh|user:and so the the people that actually do cam[p]- do camp i don't i don't really get along with them you know they're like i don't know if i could stand to being you know two days in the woods with them you know	and so because you have to know who you're going with to get along	1
agent:uh i guess the Durham Bulls [laughter]|user:all right we're on uh hey Rick who's your favorite team|agent:i heard the beep	oh okay and uh uh [laughter] we're not to have much mutual interest there but i'm curious uh uh what class are they class A	1
agent:uh not not yet i mean i|user:i- i think that was exciting too uh have you seen any minor leaguers come through uh any guys come through Raleigh that are now in the big time|agent:yeah	not yet okay well of course you're at the class A level you're a few years away from that	1
agent:yeah i don't know he's getting old i think they got their mon[ey]- their money's worth out of him though|user:and the Dodgers i guess what surprised me most about the Dodgers was letting uh Valenzuela go|user:and	yeah i think they probably did he prob[ably]- i was reading the other day that what may have happened to him is he pitched too many innings too young	0
user:uh the uh|agent:yes|user:and uh that was uh uh strictly an outstanding game	uh the Dodgers the Phillies i'm not uh you know	0
user:because|user:uh well it different times different years bec[ause]-|user:and	because my uh	0
agent:or is it it's just like that exactly|agent:have you ever seen the movie Bull Durham|agent:yeah they they give out stuff and it's	yes	1
agent:and you'll get a seat|agent:i mean you could you the game could be at seven thirty at seven fifteen and you could say hey let's go to the [laughter-game]|agent:yeah but it's	yeah but	0
agent:oh it sounds fantastic|user:and then i have a cauliflower that i would cook garlic bread green salad tea and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert|agent:uh-huh	yes and what's really neat about it is the shrimp	0
agent:uh-huh|user:uh-huh|agent:yes	and you put a little bit of that over it now if you use the dried kind	0
user:and then you serve it with melted butter and uh|user:then you remove it and you put it on a platter|agent:uh-huh	i usually put garlic powder in mine	1
agent:okay uh-huh|user:but it's got to have one that has a cover on it|agent:uh-huh	and you uh put about two tablespoons of uh	1
agent:yeah o[kay]- okay i figured about that|user:okay uh it usually serves six|agent:now how many could you serve	yeah	1
agent:is it like shrimp|user:but|agent:really	uh it's similar uh-huh	1
agent:and and where did you say you were from|user:season for them right now|user:but i mean they're fantastic tasting they are so good everybody it's it's the	Louisiana	1
user:i cook mine well|agent:no|user:huh-uh huh-uh	do you have a uh like a black iron skillet	1
agent:now would you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time|agent:oh|user:uh-huh	right	1
agent:the barbecues and the Mexican food i have a passion for all that type of different tastes because i have been brought up mostly Italian American food because my|agent:and i liked uh|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:and uh|agent:uh-huh|user:again	we're only going down there for the food though [laughter]	1
agent:gumbo right|user:no gumbo|agent:yeah jumbo	uh-huh right	1
user:um it's a problem if those voting|agent:uh bu[t]-|user:and uh but it's not clear to me that it is	don't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions but if those who don't vote if you made them vote and it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way	0
agent:that's right um|user:and uh [noise] wish i could vote on more things frankly|user:uh i guess not i'm i'm i vote religiously i really do [laughter] um i guess i guess i'm a fan of democracy	but it's funny because here in California things are getting uh increasingly democratically oriented in in the sense of people being able to vote for things i mean we have these initiatives state initiatives now	0
user:i do too|agent:wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things i think our elected officials say they are speaking for us but they're not speaking for me|agent:i	uh-huh uh-huh	0
user:and in that country it's a duty to pay taxes and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent|agent:it's a duty right|user:you know is that democratic i mean we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country we have the duty to pay taxes	and it's not clear to me that that's so much less democratic	1
user:well i that's how i feel i mean if you if you vote and your guy looses well you leas[t]- you least tried and you can say something but if you don't vote i sort of feel like|user:yeah i sort of see uh|agent:i think they feel they can criticize if they [laughter-don't] [laughter] i told them if they don't vote they don't have the right to criticize	part of me and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like well if you didn't vote you get what's coming to you you know	0
user:i|agent:i'm inte[rested]- are you a TI employee i'm interested not okay i just wondered|agent:oh i see	no i'm not	1
user:um-hum um-hum [noise]|agent:perhaps that would be a solution if they were required to vote at least for their first three or four years after they become of voting age required to register and vote for four years and perhaps|user:um	um-hum	1
user:uh|user:under certain circumstances|agent:that's right	so	0
user:and and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions|user:presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person|user:um	and can protect against the tyranny of democracy	0
agent:sometimes i think we have that right now with [laughter-Congress]|agent:[laughter]|user:except that i don't trust the people who are appointed to vote [laughter]	[noise]	1
user:i forget how many millimeters|user:yeah and it's|agent:and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths uh	so you used the metric	1
user:and|user:yes i am i i have a Suzuki motorcycle|agent:well have have you do you are you involved in any other uh metric type things like	and i've had motorcycles Japanese motorcycles for years and years and the metric system comes easy to me	1
agent:[laughter] it was a marketing ploy|user:yeah i i always wondered about that myself|agent:what's a fifth of whiskey	and and they had quarts at the same time though	1
user:yeah yeah|agent:and well what's a mill and [laughter]|user:right	but what really annoys me is the way we in the United States have been converting to metric	1
user:the engine itself was mostly metric|user:uh okay|agent:in any field for ho[w]- why why why pieces could you could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't	because it came from Canada	1
user:you go from the uh water pump up to the|user:and uh|agent:now that's strange	radiator and on the	0
user:it it can be annoying and|user:[laughter] right right|agent:you get you a pair of metric pliers right [laughter] and you beat on it and a metric hammer [laughter]	my other con[cern]- concern is	1
agent:yeah and and so um but but when you go to order a drink um you know well you say they they i don't know it's uh|user:it's all metric all ready|agent:yeah and and then but then the medicine and and some of these other things and and the chemistry in those kinds of areas milliliter	and what will a shot be will a shot be an ounce	1
user:a one|user:uh you got to have|user:uh tools for set up and for measurement	tenth indicator it's a hundred dollars	0
agent:so you've got thousands of dollars or so i mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools|user:eighty dollars a three to four for eighty dollars|user:to three for	real fast	0
user:um|user:okay [noise]|agent:[noise]	i was just trying to think about how i how i dress for work you know TI is a very casual atmosphere	1
user:uh pullover sweaters or|user:mostly what i wear are skirts and blouses or you know skirts and|user:uh but	uh	1
user:and um a lot of people just just wear jeans and and uh sweats all the time|agent:yeah|user:it's i guess it's more like a a college campus also i mean there's hundre[ds]- you know hundreds of people work for TI	and they dress up like when customers are coming in	0
user:uh-huh|user:yeah|agent:well that's good that they're so casual i mean uh my brother works for TI and he's a computer programmer or computer engineer	uh-huh	1
agent:but uh he didn't carry any ties or anything because he he just went over there with the that attitude that well if i don't take it then they won't make me wear it [laughter] because_1 uh he just|user:uh-huh|agent:oh yeah he was so excited about going	[laughter] that's true that's a good idea	1
user:yeah she always had uh|agent:uh|agent:well um y[ou]- you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions and	yeah she always had to have a lot of clothes	1
agent:i wanted to take a sewing class at school but i just haven't fit it into my schedule yet but that i mean that can really benefit|user:i'm going to be able to make my own clothes|agent:that's great	right	1
agent:oh no|user:and uh sh[e]- she used to dress him out of Neiman Marcus i mean|user:she had a she had a ba[by]- a little boy	she dressed him	1
agent:always [laughter]|user:right|user:and your[self]-	and yeah and you just have to keep buying them	1
user:and it had|agent:uh-huh|user:uh sw[eater]- sweater	uh like it was embellished around the the top you know it had uh leather leather designs and	1
agent:[laughter]|user:from the outside but but still it's you know it's really not not not a good quality|user:um	and then i was told by somebody that works for JC Penney's that um Ross Ross is just one of those places that sell[s]- sells seconds	1
agent:[laughter]|agent:[laughter-yeah] [laughter]|user:show that yeah oh oh gosh we really did support it i mean [laughter] just because we wanted to impeach him doesn't mean anything	yeah there's been uh same thing locally here a couple of uh we got a Senator who uh	0
user:yeah i i don't know it|user:yeah they uh|agent:that's true i i've been Democrat for since i've been voting which isn't that long but i'll agree with you there that there's not much organization going on	right around the turn of uh oh gosh [laughter] i should say the eighties [laughter-now]	0
agent:um-hum|user:yeah i i would be interested to see if Sam Nunn decides to go this time|user:yeah	i i	1
user:um-hum|user:yeah|user:uh i	yeah	0
agent:sort of set the agenda and and let let people do the work it's it's unfortunate how how little domestic agenda he|agent:true|user:yeah a[nd]- and i i wonder th[e]- you know if if that's i mean tha[t]- that real[ly]- that really should be all we need in a president someone who is capable of managing and that's all a president is anyway just a manager	uh	1
user:yeah|agent:and i ju[st]- here's my chance to giggle boy it's a good thing we didn't elect that Dukakis [laughter-guy] because i mea[n]-|user:yeah	well you know the interesting thing about i don't know if you've been watching Massachusetts lately	0
agent:um-hum|user:yeah and then on the other hand too while he was out busy running for the presidential thing the legislature was having their own way|user:nev[er]-	and uh you know it was ju[st]- it was a pure disaster because_1 the way it was set up	0
user:[laughter] it it wa[s]-|agent:[laughter] that's incredible oh oh there['s]- there's one thing i've got to ask you about the the dump Quayle movement i find that interesting|user:to people in Massachusetts only twenty three percent could recognize him as governor	[laughter]	1
user:i know i and i i'll tell you you know it|user:[noise]|agent:it's it's interesting to hear that Bush has i[nstead]- i[nstead]- in[stead]- instead of just making bland uh pronouncements about having no plans to change the ticket has just really emphatically come out and said no way	i i m[y]- my degree was in political science because i enjoyed it	0
agent:[laughter]|user:but the guy is so uncharismatic|user:and hoping to bring in maybe a little bit of like Kennedy charisma or something	i mean [laughter]	0
agent:yeah i know uh|user:you're probably lucky to see the end of the runway by [laughter-now]|agent:that i could see both at the same time	[laughter]	1
user:over here in Raleigh it's kind of|user:yeah if you if you're over by Asheville you're you're pretty good because you're up there in the mountains and you've got some nice ozone and all that|agent:then you get down wind of a paper mill once in a while	flat and stagnant and	1
user:and it was unseasonably warm|user:couple of weeks ago|user:and i drove through Atlanta uh	and you could see the smog	0
agent:they put so much emphasis on the private automobile|user:and it|agent:well one of the reactions i have is that uh	yeah	1
agent:the houses get coated with oil|user:yeah|agent:if they're within a block of a major expressway	yeah	0
user:i wonder too you know they keep talking about ozone depletion and all this|agent:yeah i'm not sure that we're not seeing some of the effects of that already|user:and then of course you've got all these folks cutting down on the rain forest as quick as they can	it it seems funny that it's coming around at the time when we're losing the most most of the forests	0
agent:on the tractor and i had to use it we had three uh|user:uh-huh|agent:yeah the first the first winter i moved out here i had a big snow plow	uh-huh	1
agent:oh i didn't know that|user:for severe weather in the country|user:um that was the most historic weather day in recorded history	on that one day i mean you know of course you always have severe weather somewhere	0
user:the ozone deterioration is greater than they had originally thought over some of the major metropolitan areas|user:uh talking again about the ozone layer they said that the uh|user:i read an article a couple weeks ago they were talking about uh	that's a little bit scary to think about	0
agent:a permanent high pressure area|agent:of uh meteorology i can understand the Poles because they're uh|agent:yeah that that doesn't uh fit my picture of uh	yeah	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and this is the kind of stuff that science fiction was made out of|agent:yeah	and it's the days that i keep looking for [laughter-that] aren't going to happen in my lifetime	0
user:i don't know|user:yeah there's alway[s]- there's always a drawback to everything i mean|agent:[laughter]	well	1
agent:uh-huh|user:oh yeah i talked to one we're not on the subject of course i talked to one i think he had a whole bunch of calls he had a roommate that had calls and everything he had way more twice as many calls as as i've made uh|agent:apparently a number of them have been participating	and i i'm of course we at TI just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will uh	1
user:locations not quite a few several|user:i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever and they had quite a few|user:down i think it was Campinas i'm not sure and uh	in Latin America i think the one in Mexico is closed and i think the one in in Brazil is closed but i	1
agent:in his wildest dreams from his neighbors|agent:far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking in|agent:i mean certainly we took	right	0
user:we're the North Americans we're not Americans we're North Americans|agent:oh i see|user:yeah no i mean they were saying that of us that we're the North Americans and they're Americans they they we always say we're Americans and they they want us to say	and they're South Americans yeah	0
user:when you certainly can speak their language uh and|user:we should teach Spanish at least in uh grammar school you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish i think that helps|user:and	there are problems with	1
user:i think a a common factor to a lot of problems both whether it be crime if if you want to jump on that is mostly|agent:it was pretty wild|agent:it was	uh poverty	0
user:uh they're in Taiwan and Japan|user:building a plant in Singapore|user:Japan and Singapore now just announced	and they're they haven't had	0
agent:and uh very interested in voice systems and in speech recognition|agent:yeah i'm in Computer Science|user:are you teaching Computer Science wha[t]- you said what were you saying you were teaching there	great great	1
user:oh yes i know they change with age i know mine changes uh|agent:and that's uh a big problem in speech recognition|user:right	has changed uh although you you never	0
user:far as car repairs go is is change oil and filter an and that kind of stuff|user:i don't know what the the last thing i've done|agent:[noise]	i haven't gotten really involved in anything	0
agent:oh yeah yeah basically that's it|user:and a woman asked me what that meant and i said that means that i can't work on it|user:i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it	you know	1
agent:uh-hum|user:that had the the three fifty in it|agent:yeah	and basically it it was a motor	0
agent:and uh [laughter]|user:well that's true|agent:uh well if you know [vocalized-noise] diesels don't require mechanics they require plumbers	i think the onl[y]- closest thing i've come to to a diesel is i've worked for a tractor repair shop	0
user:One of the reasons is i i'm beginning to wonder is where do you get gas at|user:i guess you're right the the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status i don't know exactly why|user:i'm	i su[re]- i don't know if it's still	0
user:uh|user:and uh if you treat them right they're not the gas guzzlers i think that they've got the reputation to be i'm convinced that|agent:uh-huh	Detroit or whoever it is	0
user:the the first well my first car was a fifty six Mustang|user:yeah that's kind of like|agent:in it to go wrong and you know changing the plugs and stuff	and uh	0
agent:i was look under the hood of that the other day and like you say you can see the road it's amazing|agent:and uh|user:yeah	yeah	1
agent:uh i don't know all that all that stuff|user:right|agent:it had all the air pump and uh	yeah the {antismog} pumps	1
agent:what an inch and a half wide got a bunch of groves in it|agent:oh it's that one that's about uh|user:uh belt on it a serpentine belt	yeah	1
user:i've got uh five stickers here from TI so i guess i've done probably uh|user:uh|agent:how many times have you done this now is this	i'd say seven or eight of them	1
user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	okay so i think i think what we should talk about is the the war	1
agent:um-hum|user:by leaving them independent|agent:um-hum	and so when Iraq you know saw this they said let's take over the country which is a good idea	1
agent:um-hum|user:you know state with a president and everything but we're not going to go into your country|user:they were uh you know named an independent	but these countries here which you know	0
user:and so the thing is is that|agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum	you're wasting so much money to send you know it's like how much money did the US spend	0
agent:yes that's really unfortunate it really is|agent:yes|agent:that's amazing	and uh	1
agent:Hussein up on you know criminal charges i don't know if that will ever happen or not|agent:i've been hearing some talk too of trying to bring|agent:um-hum	well the thing is is that first of all they got to they go[t]- they have to get him	1
agent:um-hum|user:inside Iraq for using you know chemical weapons and stuff|user:and especially since he's got	and you know like he sent planes over to to shoot the people down that were on the border with uh tha[t]- [vocalized-noise] that were on their way to Turkey	1
agent:yep|user:and we need it desperately|agent:um-hum	but the other countries that you know that have oil but not as big you know like they say	0
user:oh God|agent:ninety two|user:ninety eight	here it's like it's like a dollar five	0
user:and uh|agent:yeah|agent:yeah	it's just that you know people	0
agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum|user:everything i mean and and the expenses you know of the war you know it's like uh you know it's like who's gaining on this okay	because uh i uh does does the US government own any gas companies	0
user:you know they're just|user:but um|agent:um-hum	they're just some things that	0
agent:because we never went to war i don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out and i i feel like it went on and on|agent:i i'm not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives that was one of the questions that she asked us to think about because i|agent:looking back like maybe some of the things that i know now	right	1
agent:that was done emotionally on so many of the people|agent:and i'm not sure you can undo the damage|agent:turning around Just now you know trying to be rectified and i'm	right	1
user:no|agent:and i don't think the US will stand for it i don't think he would do that uh i think we learned too much|user:i think it would too	yeah i agree with that	1
agent:i think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that were so hateful towards the United States have come away with uh kind of a different attitude|agent:i do think that in the Middle East war um|agent:i know	uh-huh	1
user:right|user:and|agent:and perhaps the reason that good came out of the Mid East war is because we had the experience of Vietnam	exactly	1
agent:uh yeah there's a lot of people that aren't for war i'm not for war|user:uh-huh|agent:i remember the feeling back then you know like i feel like right now i feel like this country has been behind this war	right	1
agent:uh|user:and i don't even know what they're doing for themselves|agent:that's true	you know	1
user:bye-bye|agent:bye-bye|user:thanks same here	[noise]	1
user:oh yeah|agent:uh i would much prefer to like walk through the woods|user:[laughter] really [laughter]	most of m[y]- my forms of exercise come in the form of a five year old and a two year old	1
user:well that's neat my uh my husband was uh|agent:exist somehow|agent:uh uh i would have no doubt what so ever that any one of them could be dropped in the middle of no where and they'd uh they'd ex[ist]-	was a boy scout and	0
user:or she had never seen one we my husband and i had but sh[e]- we'd never seen one as a family and so we just sat and watched it for the longest time [vocalized-noise] it was you know removed from us by probably five or six feet|agent:oh what a shame|user:well it was up there actually that she got her fear of spiders because we sat and watched a tarantula for a long time we we you know we'd never seen one	so we weren't concerned about it and we just sat and watched it and we explained you know how it did well that night she had a nightmare and she has been	0
user:um|user:both of us would love to exercise on a routine basis but our life doesn't|user:we uh we we enjoy the activities that provide exercise	really have that much time in it so we just enjoy what we can along with our family you know	1
agent:there was a time here a few years ago when they put an extra tax on all the campgrounds and the uh motels|agent:well they charge extra now they|user:oh with Walt Disney World and	um	1
user:with little ones|agent:well the the trick is to stop frequently and let the kids get out and run|user:you know that's that's pretty much as far [laughter-as] we've tried	um-hum	1
agent:and it's just off the interstate and the kids would love it because they have playgrounds for the children and all and they have a uh several nature trails|user:um-hum|agent:a lodge a lodge that's what it is	it's just off the interstate that goes through Hot Springs	1
agent:and you'll you'll get a collection from them [vocalized-noise] you wouldn't believe there were so many parks in the state|user:um-hum|agent:and ask them for their literature on th[e]- the uh state national parks in the state of Texas	i probably wouldn't and i've lived here all of my life	1
user:yeah well i certainly will|agent:but be sure and stop at one of those Texas bur[eaus]- tourist bureaus and get their literature|user:[laughter] yeah	Jack it's been real it's been real uh informative for me to talk with you and i- i certainly enjoyed it	1
agent:uh it just m[akes]- absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all decimal|user:yes|user:uh-huh	yes	1
user:and uh [laughter] well i mean it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they they saw the light um i don't know why they we[re]-|agent:that's right it's all their fault|user:uh i don't know i mean even Britain has converted over and we inherited this mess from them	um were more able than we were except i think that they probably just said well we're just going to start using the things now	0
agent:well i- i don't think it'll it could ever happen with with a quick transition|agent:yep|user:every time i see something like that i think well that's that's an {antimetric} argument	you don't	1
EMPTY	[noise]	1
user:and having the family do a good share of the work you know and the part that i did was more fun than uh|agent:uh-huh|user:i it seems like i would go through a period of time where i just uh was really overworked you know and and getting out into nature and relaxing	than labor because they did the the running and toting chores and i just helped cook and	0
agent:oh|user:uh cooking merit badge in and and Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef Stroganoff and uh|user:uh always at the beginning i did all the shopping and everything but the the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his uh	i mean you know he did it up really good [laughter] and so uh after he took that merit badge he did all the shopping and preparing getting ready for it	0
agent:and bought a tent|agent:and she went out one day on the spur of the moment|agent:so my ex decided we're going to try camping	[laughter]	1
agent:oh where abouts|user:[noise] but but we camped mostly when the kids were little we were in we were in New Jersey|user:yeah yeah we have done that	and w[e]- uh in uh Allendale and uh and uh Waldwick it's just about twelve miles south of the New York border	1
agent:uh-huh|user:fairly near by you don't have to go very far|user:yeah it is neat though because there are lots of lakes	and uh and there's uh a lot of trees lot of mountains and lot of uh hiking	0
agent:yeah|user:you and your dog huh [laughter] hey that sounds great|agent:ye[s]- well just me and my dog	well we don't we don't camp quite as much as we used to but uh i still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family and	0
user:[noise]	but a lot of women are are knowl[edge]- as knowledgeable about pro football as i am	0
agent:uh-huh|user:he primarily you know with the quarterbacks that would be his specialty|agent:yes	i wished i wished they could work something i really like him i really do	1
agent:i don't know i hope they they do better they they during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better|user:how do you think the Steelers are going to do this year you have any idea|agent:uh-huh	uh-huh	1

user:income tax for those who don't have it that is i mean we don't have one yet but|user:uh most all government entities are just trying to give us a state|user:yeah i mean we're we're taxed on taxes and um	eventually they may try to push it through	1
user:it takes such a size out of your paycheck that|user:that|user:really overburdened from federal state and local	there's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck	1
user:uh i don't know how we're going to do that right away though but|agent:i agree|user:and uh	what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is	1
agent:to see if we could sort of clean them up and you know but i don't know if we can do that or not|user:yeah|user:right [laughter]	a lot of people have become too complacent and	0
agent:so i don't know i i i have no idea what to do about it|user:hum|user:yeah	well there's no quick solution or no sure fire	1
user:to|user:vote|user:or	limit	1

user:oh|agent:noticed i wasn't around that much you know with all the children around the house it's kind of hard to notice that dad isn't around very much [noise]|agent:when the twins were about three years old and uh they never you know i don't think they	right	1
agent:yeah|user:that's difficult|agent:um he's taken off for parts unknown but uh	yeah	1

agent:you know he uh he worked a full-time job and a part-time job and i never saw him|agent:and uh|user:yeah	uh-huh	0
agent:the mental capacity to raise them [laughter] and|agent:the capability to uh create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the uh|user:and uh	right right	0

user:i have i'm really torn on the subject|user:well|agent:how do you feel about [laughter]	i'm not a good candidate for this one i see what you see and i agree with you	1
agent:however if you were living in Mexico in those conditions would you have several children|user:i have real sympathy for those people i really do and you can|agent:um	probably they don't have birth control	1
agent:uh|user:and boy i tell you ha[ppily]- happily|agent:um	i can i can understand just a little bit of Cuban English	0
agent:yeah|user:i really do and it's only fair to the children i think making giving the children an out that they don't have to speak English|agent:i think so too	is just encouraging them to drop out later on	0
user:there are too many children|user:i mean|agent:uh-hum	that are just conceived and produced and dropped on society	0
user:and basically the question started out|user:discussion group|user:long	that as at the time when there were starving people in India i believe	0

agent:television career as it were and i i wonder if uh|agent:yeah yeah i i've seen Heat of the Night through off and on through out it's uh|user:people got a lot to learn everywhere	right	1
agent:no the uh the All in the Family reruns that are sh[owing]- showing now they they really take whatever point they're wanting to make they they reiterate it over and over you know it's as if the the intelligence level of the people that watch this or something other they handle over a wide you know range of of uh topics but uh|user:course the this is The Heat of the Night isn't it|user:right	oh oh the All in the [Ha/Family] Family right right right	1
user:the Archie Bunker with his uh|user:and then uh|user:at the time	antiquated uh the rednecked uh	0
agent:so how do you keep up with the news|agent:[noise]	most of it is TV	1
user:too quick to try to get a scoop and not checking facts out and i think that's probably a a good relevant|user:oh i think uh during the Middle East Crisis there was a problem in terms of|agent:how accurate exactly	uh	1
user:and radio is sort of a catch up in fact|agent:[noise] uh|agent:or where they're at with the news or something along those lines	i was um listening to the radio the other day and that	0

user:like uh|agent:almost religiously|user:i wonder sometimes where they get those topics you know the some of the topics are very very good and others are	who who who dreamed this subject up you know [vocalized-noise]	0
user:uh-huh|agent:yeah we've watched little bits here and there during the Gulf Crisis and we|user:and there's not the pressure then	yeah	1
agent:but on occasion more than occasionally we'll buy the local paper|agent:and uh|user:Denver paper okay	uh-huh	0
agent:and|user:both sides and i think when uh|user:uh i think they they withhold when it's advantageous both sides	Norman	0
agent:oh of course and you've got to expect that|user:he was playing games you know and and they both were i think that's all part of warfare is to play games|user:that	yeah	1

user:and um well i work all week|agent:yeah|user:well you know i can't imagine how i did because now i work all the time	and um	1
user:the thing|agent:that's you did that's what you did|user:i mean it is so far down the road where now when i graduated high school	uh-huh and then you got married and then you had a family	0
user:yeah|agent:you know spending time here it's your turn you know|user:right	but you know that now even whenever i was coming up and everything	0
agent:yeah|user:oh but that you know you better you better just get ready now|user:right i mean they thought that it was terrible you know and then when i'd tell them you know well i'm just not ready for children yet	well you don't just get ready	0
user:it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples|user:kids didn't fit in right then but|user:and uh	and	0
agent:and i saw how life was when she stayed home and it was rough it was hard [noise] you know|user:yeah|agent:you know she worked too and i guess i just [noise]	yeah and it really is i know it [vocalized-noise] just like now you know there's	0
user:and uh|agent:uh-huh|user:i'm not old but i'm older	i got to stay home with my kids	0
user:you know so many women could not afford like you said if you had four kids|user:but the reason they had to do this was because so many people|agent:are they	or even if you had two kids you would be paying	1
agent:if if it's a what kind of phone do they ta[lk]- it['s]- not a dial but if it's a touchtone it's okay|agent:uh|user:okay i got a i i'm using a cordless	y[eah]- right	1
agent:organizations we drop ours off at Fort Worth if they're still alive and you keep it alive which is hard to do for a couple of weeks|agent:there are|user:oh	uh-huh	1

agent:interests i don't really quite have the time with with two daughters and everything|agent:sh[e]- she had this thing with the fence and i i guess i have so many|agent:and then she just never wanted a dog and then we got here to Texas uh she's from Texas again and uh	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah|user:she still would come in so fast and so heavy that she'd dig her paws deep down into my carpet you know and just take out running to and she would|user:this is a [laughter-fifty] [laughter-pound] dog i'm going to pick up a leg at a time and wash and set it down on something clean while i got the other three you know and and then i'd let her in the house well still even putting her feet in the bucket of water and wash them_1 real good	oh she was ruining my carpet and i thought gosh i i love my new house more than i love her i [laughter-think] you know i just really have a big investment and i don't i just	0
agent:and they're crying|user:yeah|agent:in their eyes you know they just walk in the house even though we lock up the cats	that's right	1
agent:of course he had several horses for shots and different things i thought my God|user:just to f[eed]-|user:uh-huh	oh	1
agent:my goodness from what|user:got paralyzed from her waist down and uh waist|user:oh she's my best friend and when when i lived in Orlando she uh	and i thought it was uh	0

agent:well they're they're they're really very strong academic rather than you know big sports [vocalized-noise]|user:uh-huh while they're east coast i mean i don't know anything about their football but there you go|user:wow i can i	yeah that's where where you at	1
user:this this is true|user:uh-huh|user:and	yeah	1
agent:what kind of environment he liked and yet he he did wind up having to make a choice he did apply to a large you know large group|user:uh-huh|agent:he is very very strong academically yeah so we've just but you know he had to look to see	yeah University of Penn i'm originally from Pennsylvania Pennsyl[vania]- University of Pennsylvania	1
agent:[laughter] okay [laughter]|user:yes|agent:and did you ever eat at the Blue Bin Diner	oh my God where are you from well let's not talk about that [laughter]	1
agent:he said is he went to Pennsylvania this weekend and he had an absolutely marvelous time he had a great time|user:[laughter]|agent:he's been talking to them and and he came down and one of the things that	uh-huh	1
agent:so that and he will know the professors in a small|agent:that's yeah yeah and a swim coach is going to be right on top of you uh|user:and you're going to get a little bit more input [laughter] than discipline yeah	well i don't know how to put this either in this way and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this but i just think the other thing is	0
agent:graduate assistants teaching they have graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups|user:they have video lectures yeah video lectures|user:oh	this is true and i mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the did he just make the decision today	1
agent:he's um he's gonna be a junior he'll be he's finishing his sophomore year|user:and now he's a sen[ior]- he's a senior or is this early admissions|agent:and he had thought about economics and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't	so he's	0
agent:say till they were about two years old i preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home and that's what i looked for and i was lucky enough to find one right across from my school and that worked yeah that worked out real well|agent:i wanted when they were very young when they were babies|agent:and um	well that's good	1
agent:oh that's wonderful|user:so that if my wife does um does go back to work part time um [noise] there probably will be a possibility that i could stay home two days that she would go to work and that i would have to teach at night|user:most of the time you have so much flexible hours so that i could probably work two or three days a week and then one or two evenings	yeah so it will probably workout real nice for us uh i think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules	0
user:um|agent:uh-huh|agent:sure	um where you know he then they waited a couple years and and he got himself pretty far along i guess they didn't have kids until he was about	0
user:yep yeah definitely|user:um-hum|agent:i uh was a teacher i uh still am teacher and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was that was that was what i wanted where i could have piece of mind and when i taught school and i knew my kids were being taken care of yeah and plus i	we're safe	0
user:um-hum|user:uh-huh|user:yeah	yeah	0
agent:but uh it is a big problem and you know i have lot of friends right now that uh have young children and they daily have problems with with whoever is taking care of the child or they switch a lot which is not good for the child either|user:uh-huh|agent:successful adults i should say you know really	um-hum	1
user:th[e]- um|agent:exactly well and they most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars so|user:my goodness if if you want them to be able to drive the car the insurance bill	oh	1
agent:oh they come in see this is the first time i've done this|user:well normally they come in uh|user:[laughter]	oh oh cause they'll come in in ten minutes normally and stop us	1
agent:uh-huh|user:school system of Boston|user:um [vocalized-noise] one thing you know that i always think about when i think of public education because_1 i went through the public um	and uh	0
agent:so it's interesting that you chose that topic [laughter]|user:right|agent:so that's kind of at a higher level [laughter]	yeah	0
user:and|agent:uh-huh|user:you know everyday to fill out an application	they'll have to bring somebody with them and they will show that they completed	0
user:um they uh i forget wh[at]- i think it's um [noise]|user:i know|agent:it's pretty sorry	someplace in New York	1
agent:yeah|user:NC State that's a state university then|agent:NC State	i see [noise] and you're from there also	1
user:that's good i went to a private university|agent:yeah|user:oh well that's good	and um	1
user:and i i feel like w[hat]- what i've learned working|agent:uh-huh|user:i- i really felt like i've been working now for about four years	is a hundred times more valuable than what i learned in school	0
user:um there's uh a large minority|agent:um-hum|user:and uh the school that she's in is a um [noise] it's basically for minorities	population	1
user:and seeing what they could do versus somebody that you know did excel|agent:yeah|user:out of taking somebody that wasn't as successful	in in areas	0
agent:oh well [laughter]|user:i don't know it|agent:the ACC Tarheels UNC	[noise] i don't get down there very often	1
agent:ah i can't wait to [laughter-graduate] either now i got all these stuff due oh wow|user:i couldn't wait to graduate and have it be all over|user:i- i couldn't do it i	i know	1
agent:ah|user:an[d]- i think they're regulated by the state as to how many they can take in at one time|agent:oh	so i'm not sure how anybody checks up on that but um	0
user:if say if you were in the [vocalized-noise] in a situation having to locate a uh child care center how old you go about determining whether somebody was competent or not take care of your kids|user:uh|user:yeah i think that would take care of any questions about competency for people running the show	i think that's a big question	1
user:where if they can't get there regular uh sitter or a child care service to take there kids if they reserve slots|user:for some of their uh uh important employees|agent:uh-huh	with these other um companies um very expensive rates but they can drop their kid off uh	0
agent:uh well we have one now who um is is part time she works uh half days [vocalized-noise] actually we have two one paralegal and one secretary and one attorney each have very young children and now they are part timing it is kind of like a test to see how this will work to have these people work part time|agent:we've had some that have had their children and not come back so it just depends i think|agent:weigh that um	uh-huh	1
agent:always back in there and she's a|agent:and she just really can't sit still enough to just be home with the baby she has to have you know something else she's always been one who's put in you know like the fifty to sixty hour work week and after she had the baby she was coming back in to check her office and to check her in box you know like ten days later she was back in and we were like Cathlene you got two months off you know you don't have to be back in there she's just|agent:but uh Cathlene the part timer she says you know she just doesn't she she's always one of these workaholic kind of people	uh-huh [laughter]	1
user:in terms of fair restricting guns and|user:um i guess on a o[ne]- a [laughter-scale] of one to ten i'm probably around a two [laughter]|user:uh so i've been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it	i have to admit most of that is uh strong personal distaste i	0
agent:and on top that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military as a Green Beret i definitely respect the power of weaponry|user:um-hum|agent:and what their capabilities are	um-hum it's pretty powerful isn't it [laughter]	1
user:what i don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because_1 pretty soon it's [laughter] it wouldn't|user:um-hum um-hum|agent:if they want to ha[ve]- want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that i've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county that's fine too	you don't want to have someone making a personal choice in that way	1
agent:handle the weapon how to safely handle the weapon how to properly maintain it the three basics|agent:properly|agent:you got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to	well that makes a lot of since to me i mean i certainly feel that if if we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm but uh i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm they have as much responsibility to know how to do	0
agent:if a citizen of the state being myself|agent:that|agent:legislation's been introduced as	um-hum	1
agent:if i'm [vocalized-noise] draw at the same time|user:well i'm i'm sure i'm sure given given all your training i'm sure that you know you'd [laughter] if i walk into a bad neighborhood i'm sure i'd want to walk through with you because i'm sure you have good|agent:i feel it before they'll get the gun on me	you know uh f[ar]- far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them_1 effectively and everything	0
agent:i won't even blink|agent:anybody trie[s]- anybody tries to hurt them|user:yeah don't it	no i i understand that	0
agent:okay Janet could you tell me what your thoughts are|user:okay|agent:here we go	well i think the idea of public uh health services is a good one i think that we all	0
agent:but yet they were paid for it too|user:uh-huh|agent:uh there was a lot of people out of work so the government brought them in i mean they they performed a a public service	well that's true and of course there was the need there and they didn't have any other resource	0
agent:yeah i think i think we need it in this country|agent:uh yeah like yeah|user:be in a constant learning environment i- i don't know	but uh	1
agent:that that can't get into college either they can't afford it or or perhaps they don't have the abilities|agent:we have we have a lot of people that are in college and we have a lot of people that [noise] for one reason or another|user:rather than taking all that manpower out of the US and providing a service for people to join here and do some good we could come up with some of those things	um-hum	1
agent:highway system you know the the freeways|agent:i'm not sure who started the national|agent:um	um-hum	1
user:in reality there's so much more traffic and so many more lines and|user:that we now get upset because we have to wait in line or wait in traffic but in|user:now i thought that was just a sign of the times we're all stressed out that's what they're trying to tell us that	really like you say something needs to be done about that too	1
agent:ordinary jobs|agent:[noise] is defeating itself because they get more money from welfare than they can working at|user:you know	that's very true	1

user:my wife was reading in Consumer Reports i think the week later about the car seats and apparently that's a pretty st[andard]- standard practice|user:yeah in fact the way he acted it happened all the time and uh|agent:did you have your receipt	that they only put those clips in in about a third of the boxes because not everybody needs them_1 with the seat belts that they've got	1
agent:i[tem]- item so that you could afford to go buy the glue or the special thread it was going to take or the patch or whatever you know|agent:and you'd be willing to do that repair if you got price off if you got mark down|user:um-hum	uh-huh	1
user:ends you know if there's a complaint they take care of it right away because_1 they don't want any bad PR and they do want|user:do a good job on both|user:to have a good product and take care of the customer	return business	1

user:i'm graduating with just a soil science degree|user:well|agent:yeah what is your specialty	here in North Carolina but i hopefully will go to California to receive a PhD in uh	0
agent:and that's got to be solved i think there has to be public trust in it before you can|agent:take care of their product|agent:some of the waste management companies in terms of how well they do	yes uh i agree with you	1
user:uh yeah i i hate to think about it|agent:oh [laughter] well let's hope that you you you aren't e[mployed]- employed by that craft for too long|user:i think it'll become resume writing	and and i'm getting rather good at reading want ads	1
user:ten percent of six fifty sixty five and twenty percent would be|user:so|agent:uh-huh	one thirty	1

user:hasn't been a long|user:well|user:good good	time [vocalized-noise] TI or i	1
user:just|agent:uh-huh|user:and i seem rather happy about it most of the time	just to know	1
user:uh situational|agent:the the the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you dec[ide]- decide on a pass|agent:well i'm sure it's just with the	i	0
agent:[laughter] well actually uh the the the Plano Dallas Houston you know Austin that whole area is is actually quite quite nice|user:but then they they tell me hell is much better than west Texas|agent:uh-huh [laughter] well just take the day	i	1
user:oh|agent:yeah that's a it it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it|agent:um-hum	i've had job offers	1
agent:yeah i can imagine you know the longer and longer it goes|user:i've been with them sixteen|agent:yeah	actually seventeen now	1
user:as|user:and i'm looking at it as|agent:um-hum	an adventure	1
agent:um-hum|agent:right [noise]|user:through our lives i guess as economics and as kids come and go and uh situations change uh we used to do	quite a bit of dining out before the children and then as they came along and uh additional expenses sitting came into every	0
agent:yes|agent:yeah|user:high dollar uh hundred and fifty dollar dinner type deal which they're forty to fifty miles away and they're they're all around but they're just a ways so	we can do a good um twenty twenty five dollar night out and have a decent steak and it comes out okay	1
agent:to go through the trouble of digging the sitters and everything just to go and so what i have found now that um|agent:sometimes it's not [laughter-worth] [laughter-it]|agent:[noise] places that you went before spur of the moment that might be nice but casual um	right	1
agent:uh-huh|user:oh i don't know a motif to the entire uh shopping center it's the anchor for this entire strip shopping center i guess|user:a	and they'll the entire place is	0
agent:wow [laughter]|user:we killed about a an hour or so doing that because it was about an hour and a half wait to get into the restaurant and uh then about thirty minutes worth of a meal or so thirty or forty five minutes there and then|agent:um-hum	uh came back out and walked around a little bit more and went home so	0
user:different uh|user:and i feel like that now if i went if i had gone to a small college that only had a couple of thousand that i wouldn't have have gotten as much exposure to different people and|user:in a kind of general sense i like large colleges because i went to University of Texas at Austin they have fifty thousand students there	i don't know different languages different cultures and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students	1
user:yeah|user:um-hum|user:right	y[eah]-	0
agent:i think that's probably key to me is not so much the size of the school|agent:yeah|agent:uh-huh	um-hum	1
agent:those needs besides education y[ou]- y[ou]- you can expect|agent:what school or schools can best meet those|agent:and what	um-hum	1
agent:i i'm i'm older than you i've been out for twenty one years|agent:i guess i guess now i've been out for|user:uh	um-hum	1
user:wow|user:right|user:um-hum	that's great	1
agent:i was going to ask who won [laughter]|agent:uh-huh|user:the life experience out of it and so it was you know she went the academic way because she's a straight A student	which is y[eah]- yeah yeah so she you know that's probably you know what she what she wants anyway but	0
agent:and because i knew all along that's what i wanted|user:right um-hum|agent:a[nd]- and i think i value my my education more because i had to work for it	um-hum	1
user:when you when you do want when you do finally graduate|user:right because|agent:to make [vocalized-noise] to give you the the potential to do whatever you wanted	that that's what you need the most i'm finding out now that what i'm needing the most now is not smarts not what i can do on paper	0
user:industry pollution and you know they're reg[ulation]- they're regulation that's placed on them is|user:that's the problem but also like you said the|user:as our population increases and you know our of course our our cars you know our number of cars increase per the population	i mean it's better than it used to be but it's incredible that they still	0
agent:yeah|agent:those chemicals would not|user:yeah they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff you know to to break the flours down and then they they also do testing there	and i don't you know wh[en]- when you consider	0
agent:any of the plants over on this uh the we[st]- east side does|agent:that much as far as uh|agent:we're on the southwest side of Houston we don't have	uh-huh	1
user:one cow i was like my God and they and this thing says that|agent:oh|user:and they and i read in this article i couldn't believe it where you know like one cow produces like a day produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure	that you know i[f]- people think well cow manure is good for fertilizer but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not it's not	0
agent:yeah|user:like ponds that they had to filter it with but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years they just overflow and they overflow into the the creeks and stuff in the area|agent:uh-huh	so that just creates you know there there's and oh it was just disgusting it said the creeks will foam	0
user:uh i think the only the main thing is just keep on the legis[lators']- your legislators' back you know as far as|agent:uh-huh|user:is working properly and you you know they're suppose nowadays they have the emission controls on them but	seems like	0
agent:is this like roadside collection|user:what the they were doing uh|user:but i don't think the city necessarily supported	yeah	0
user:that has been taken away it's not there anymore i mean that thing was always full because people|user:but uh|user:that uh you could put plastic jugs on one side and newspapers on another and glass on the third	really brought stuff to it all the time	0
user:like for recycling aluminum or|user:were to uh uh pay|user:yeah it would definitely help you know even if they	uh newspapers or whatever i mean they used to	0
agent:you just can't throw that in with your|agent:because you know say shampoo bottles i think was the example they gave there's no they don't even give you any indication of what kind of plastic that is|user:hum	hum	1
user:or or two thousand people|user:five thousand people|user:for every	uh you know just scattered throughout the city	0
user:you know and i read that|user:and you know i think it's great i use it all the time|agent:yeah so am i	the companies now save like what fifteen thousand trees or whatever because of that and i thought that's great	1
agent:you know the the the cost of building is already|agent:it intimidates people you know it's easier to buy something that's|agent:the cost of processing that it just	once again the bottom line counts [laughter]	1
agent:what kind of a dog is he|user:and so this is just really strange you know because|agent:uh-huh	um	0

agent:well i i'll i hope you'll find him you most likely will|user:and that we just went all over the place and i knew we were going to find him you know and when we didn't it was like oh no [laughter] so|user:i just knew today uh you know we looked at the pound and	i don't know	1
agent:and uh and if he doesn't come by mid morning then i really get scared but he's always come back eventually so|agent:yeah i know sometimes our cat will will stay out all night and when he's not right at the door in the morning i really worry that something's happened to him that somebody he's got in a fight or you know somebody's hit him and|agent:yeah isn't it though that is that's	well that's good that's one thing about cats though they're so small	0
agent:well how did he get out|agent:yeah|user:ye[ah]- uh-huh yeah the backyard it's real big too for him to run in and stuff that's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out [laughter] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] because_1 he got all this room to run in and	but	1

user:want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage or whatever there your issue is then|user:but i think y[ou]- you you really hit the nail on the head for the average person is exactly what he can use it for and if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending out letters or if you don't|agent:um-hum	there really is	1
agent:you're kidding|user:for six hundred dollars|user:computer with a not not a uh necessarily a slow one or or inadequate one but a pretty good one	no hm th[at]-	1
user:well that's the|user:and|agent:well what what is a a a good brand a f[or]- inexpensive	that's the deal is you're not buying brands now you're buying these knock offs	0
agent:i see how do you go about getting one of those uh catalogs|user:the main computer the circuit board|user:a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards	they're available in you know the B Daltons that that type of thing	1

agent:[noise]|user:good day thank you goo[d]- same to you|agent:yeah Mike you take care now good luck to you	[noise]	1
agent:the the major cities anyway because i think that you know the people that are involved in the drug scene out|agent:i guess uh it is really scary but the uh recognizing or i think recognizing that a lot of the crime in these smaller cities is really geared toward|agent:right uh	that's right	1
agent:from the criminal element th[at]- th[at]- probably that does not even compare|agent:but then when you turn around and look at at what's going on|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:the restrictions on you know crime investigation and stuff so|agent:lightened up a little bit on some of the|user:yes	um-hum	1
agent:spending time in jail and i think they even give credit sometimes for the|user:yeah|agent:with uh appeals and all that and getting time credit for	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|agent:students for the children|agent:well i think uh uh you know back to uh back to uh the the school situation the parents are the ones that that that demand all the rights for these	right	1
user:um-hum|agent:that uh you don't want your kids associating with if you can help it|user:that's right	that's right if you can help it that's key you know	1
agent:not a whole lot different there than it is|agent:and you know so they you notice that it's not|user:yeah that's right	no	0
agent:yeah yeah we|agent:but they're doing|user:no i don't either as a matter of fact i think they're doing you know probably for the most part the best job they can do with resources they have	it's really must be discouraging though to know that	0
user:um-hum|agent:yeah you you've got a they get a a domestic uh violence or do[mestic]- domestic dispute and they get there and both of the parties turn on them|user:apparently it's very dangerous you just never know	um that's right	1
agent:it's just enjoying the melody|agent:um|agent:and i tend to like instrumental better because there isn't that underlying theme there's no message to be get to be gotten there	what	1
user:what|user:okay|agent:i don't know it's it's a lot more complex	does this type of music have to do like when i go to the book store and i see new age books	0
agent:well yeah he's kind of a new age|user:so you could label Kenny G as a new age|user:yeah so	okay i was wondering	1
agent:what what what kind of music do you like to listen to mostly|user:well that's cool|user:yeah	um	1
user:i like it you know it's you've got some top forty hits and i'm sure you know he's geared to that but there are some songs that are|user:what was the name of the latest album i have it it's um|user:the	pretty cool on that and you know with the videos and stuff now coming out	0
agent:[noise]|user:right you don't know until you listen to it|agent:and some of it is really good and i don't know the good from the bad	so	0
agent:and that's pretty much all i listen to|agent:um|agent:um i do like a lot of the older stuff too but we don't really have a lot of the older stuff on CD	did you	1
user:uh i think this|user:and i don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective|user:uh i've had teenagers and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers	me generation has gone far too far	0
user:some type of college uh|user:out on a limb here|user:and i'm i'm	volunteer work for teachers	0
agent:as far as ge[tting]- yeah getting doctors and all that kind of stuff yeah|user:have have a disadvantage that we don't understand because we're in the Metroplex|agent:yeah	right you know if if we	0
agent:if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it|agent:what it's like|agent:kids now that have everything given to them_1 that they want to see	right right	0
user:i'm wondering if there's another issue here|user:but|user:right you know they they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat	and maybe this is why this has died out	1
agent:yeah|user:i- i i don't know that um|user:i don't know that it does	if you step back from the current issue	0
user:of being winnowed out|user:and i'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there|user:that are endangered or obsolete	there's a German word for it that's elegant but i never can remember what it was uh	1
user:because their society isn't there anymore|user:uh i felt sorry for them_1|user:sad little things	and their belief system and a[ll]- all their structured	0
agent:help these people you know and no[t]- i'm not saying just give them_1 money but i mean because_1 they have to be taught to be|agent:to um|agent:half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize that it's everybody's responsibility	that's the last thing you want to do	1
user:in fact we've got far too many|user:uh we've got plenty|agent:yeah	you're in uh what [vocalized-noise] Flower Mou[nd]-	1
user:okay|user:there you go|user:good	yeah	1
user:yes we had to go across the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey [laughter] to get|user:and we went in we explained what we needed and|user:and we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with and they were very happy with the system and they felt they've gotten a good price	to meet these people	0
agent:hm|user:at this point we only have one board so it wasn't so bad so we used it a bit but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because_1 we really need to be able to put at least three in|user:and	and	1
user:and so we said fine|user:this doesn't really work anyway and etcetera and they're and they were doing it at their own costs|user:okay so they did that and we said are you sure that this will work we don't want you to go through the work and then find out that	and we went back and we talked to the technical person a second time and things like that	0

agent:so that occupies a lot of the [laughter-time]|user:um-hum|agent:nine month old	i would imagine about the only time i usually preempt for i think like Monday night we usually uh watch a lot of TV because that's when Murphy Brown and uh	0
agent:[laughter] should be interesting|agent:[laughter]|agent:oh no [laughter]	it's	0
agent:right|user:and when i first saw it i i haven't been able to see it very often but when i first saw it i said well well this looks like it's it's going to you know go over like a lead balloon it uh doesn't look like it's going to be good at all|agent:uh-huh	but the few times i've seen it i guess it's something that grows on you	1
user:oh uh|agent:oh what was the one that Gilda Radner did|agent:and uh	uh it's al[ways]- not it's always something but uh	0
agent:wasn't it Bruce Willis that did the voice|agent:you know with uh|user:yeah um-hum	yeah um-hum	1

agent:but at to me it's every minute's agony and i in fact i don't run i hate to run like when i walk i'll take along a radio or something and that helps you know pass the time|agent:i don't and i have an older sister that loves running too and she runs all the time|user:i do too	uh-huh	1
agent:right|user:i feel like once i've done it if i'm sweaty i might as well do an extra thirty [laughter-more] [laughter-minutes] because you've already kind of shot your night but|agent:yeah	but um so i'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Tuesday Thursday now that i can just kill two nights and	0
agent:easy they make it as easy as they possibly can for you|agent:uh-huh yeah i can see that would be uh|user:and just the fact that i can just go straight from my desk over to the the recreation center and do it helps a lot	oh yeah [laughter]	1
agent:um|agent:huh-uh|user:no not at [laughter-all] [laughter] pretty cheap	so and then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership but	0
agent:oh yeah|user:okay you ready to talk about taxes|agent:oh yeah	okay	1

agent:uh-huh|user:uh and i have no idea i have no idea what it is but you know getting back to the [vocalized-noise] getting back to the Federal income tax i remember during the Reagan administration i think it was the Tax Reform Act of nineteen eighty six or something like that|agent:uh-huh	when the taxes were reduced and it was made simpler and all that kind of stuff	0
agent:what happened|user:guess what|agent:oh wow	that that's not legal in Texas it's the only state in the country that it's not legal everybody else can do it but in Texas	1
agent:uh-huh|user:Americans paid about one cent on the dollar in taxes|user:and he was saying that in nineteen fifty four	and now we're paying something like a little over fifty fifty cents	0
agent:really|user:uh and and and uh however my goodness they got an assistant principal for everything|agent:yeah i've heard that	and and and they've got uh i don't know what the ratio is but they've got a tremendously high ratio of administrative people to people that are actually out there teaching	0
user:but the uh uh the tax thing and i think our sales tax is uh|user:and uh so i'm i'm not i'm not overly pleased with that either|user:and [laughter] and and all that	uh somewhere around eight percent now isn't it	1

agent:figures|user:started getting toward a dollar a gallon range somebody had uh i believe it was Exxon|user:i kind of remember back when gas prices started up uh you know pretty dramatically when they	we we were living in uh	0
agent:buying power over the age o[f]- or you know under the age of thirty or so to have some idea what it is anyway|agent:with any kind of|agent:it's i would expect people	yeah	0
user:will be shot or something like that you know|agent:[laughter]|user:you know anybody caught talking in the English m[etric]- you know in the	but uh [laughter] uh	1
agent:you just you know you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs|agent:and it got to you know somewhere down the line they went standardized they went microns but uh|user:um-hum um-hum	yeah	0
user:so|agent:yeah|user:a[nd]- because_1 they they didn't understand anything else you know if you start talking about miles they'd look at you like what you know	uh i had	0
agent:getting warm right|agent:yeah|user:well i had kind of gotten used to uh centigrade temperature you know if it's between zero and ten it's cold and if it's between ten and twenty it's not too bad if it's between twenty and thirty it's pretty warm and if it's more than thirty it's just hotter than all get out so	but uh the big problem is not having the uh	0
agent:one point one point eight times as many|user:yeah five [vocalized-noise] [laughter-well] i|agent:what it works out to	yeah something like that yeah	1
agent:right|user:and the thing had uh uh an Austin Heeley type uh engine you know it was Austin motors engine and running gear|user:one of these little Nash Metropolitans here a few years ba[ck]- you know quite a few years back	and the body was built by Nash or who you know American it wasn't that was even before American Motors but	0
user:but it's got the darndest combination of uh|user:matter of fact the thing is i always say it's built off shore [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-because_1] it was assembled in Canada the only thing that was in it was built in the US was the uh differential and it was built in Buffalo New York|user:Chevy van that's a couple of years old uh part of it's built in Canada	of metric and	1
agent:yeah|user:yeah you'd have a hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five but you'd have people going you're right a hundred miles an hour yeah|agent:oh hell you'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour	and so	0
user:yeah|user:i wa[s]-|agent:sooner or later they'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way	i know the only other place that i was ever at where they really had it mixed was was in Panama where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in uh	0
agent:a lot of things that happen in the movie the only thing really scary about it is that it could happen to you it really does happen in real life you know nor[mally]- normally in movies you can look at it and say well it's a movie|agent:and so|agent:and i read the story in People magazine about where they got the characters in the movie and they're a combination of a lot of different serial killers in real life	and that doesn't really happen	0
agent:i'm about a quarter Italian and my grandmother on my mother's side is a little bit of everything typical [laughter-American] little bit of Indian little bit of this little bit of that|agent:um|user:what's your heritage	oh	1
user:and um|agent:right|user:that it was real it wasn't something i'd just read in books it was something i was taught	and so you know like the the scene with the buffalo	0
user:yeah i think that it yeah|agent:on so many things|user:um-hum	tried to make people	0
agent:right|user:and it can be enjoyed by all if shared|agent:right	i mean but but that's what we did to the Indians we said	0
agent:he with the most toys [laughter]|agent:yeah that's true|user:yeah but he who has the biggest stick is still going to win	[laughter]	0
agent:and all the girls were crying when they walked out and all the guys were just kind of staring straight ahead like that didn't bother me and you know it [laughter-did]|agent:it w[as]- i i think everybody felt that way through it it was ve[ry]- real involved|user:[laughter]	goodness	1

user:um-hum|agent:his old records and stuff and i remember when i was in high school y[ou]- combing record stores anytime i could get the chance uh for something of his and now it all seems for not you know you can get his old stuff on CD [laughter] [laughter-it's] [laughter-like] what were all those hours those little treasures i have but i have originals you know [laughter]|user:hum	yeah uh	1

user:um|agent:pop cans and things like that|agent:well down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your you know	no	0
agent:well|user:and i think they're trying to|agent:because_1	to make some changes i i noticed at the library or someplace this past	1
user:the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage|user:rather than bag it up because of a[ll]- all the|agent:uh-huh	trucks and stuff	1
user:yeah|agent:but i didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water that was surprising to me|agent:in the sink when i brush my teeth	um	1
user:and lawn additives and that type of thing|user:recently for organic fertilizers and|user:yeah i noticed that about things like i s[een]- i seen a lot of adds	but the cost is is like double or sometimes triple	1
user:yeah|agent:that's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway [laughter] you have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf you haven't got enough nerve to say well put it back it's not recyclable|user:um	i i'd heard something stranger talk about bottles	0
user:they don't expand or|agent:oh|user:very easily and	or contract when the weather changes and [laughter] this is kind of an unusual use for	1
user:in front of the public so they understand how|user:well i think the the more people are aware of it the the more they'll do i think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in|agent:i never realized i really didn't realize how much stuff i actually throw away	serious the problem is and how important it is to do that	1
agent:and now i think you're seeing that a little bit more it's coming back again|agent:children|agent:i felt like i was one of the few people that truly wanted t[o]-	oh is that right	0
agent:to get get our family pretty quick you know and|agent:we decided to you know we wanted to|agent:my husband was quite a bit older when we married and	yeah right yeah	1
agent:sex education|agent:they're lot more progressive more pointed|user:yeah	right	1
user:you had family that was|agent:that's right|user:that's that's a big problem because at least i- i see that up here when when i was growing up and going to school uh people never locked their doors and uh you know	generally in the area most people kind of stayed put you know very few moved away	1
agent:oh yeah|user:passed on a lot quicker with|user:information is is	with TV and radio and uh	0
agent:right at the same time they're getting them_1 you know six weeks later|user:that's right|agent:you know	yeah	1
user:uh they|user:no it it goes back i guess way way back [noise] people had a lot of children and they and they they were kind of|agent:you know it's not the same that we [laughter] traditionally thought of	most of them were on farms i guess or they worked in factories	0
user:you know|agent:um|agent:i don't know	labor is to to take care of the crops	1
user:i know uh that Texas laws are more|user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	uh what's the word i want more	1

user:uh-huh|agent:doesn't even fit the crime but you can't get any worse|agent:um you know to me the punishment	they uh [noise] i th[ink]- to me i think they have to come to that with	0
agent:pretty painful way to go i don't know|agent:you know the electric chair on the other hand is probably a|agent:um but uh	um	1
user:i can't imagine uh a mother standing by and watching something destructive happen to her children|user:where you would think there might not be the help uh there is help for women who are abused or children who are abused or whatever uh|user:even in this area	but i have a friend who's is a school teacher and she has a nine year old girl in her room who is suffering abuse and the mother is aware of it and is not	1
agent:suffering as they have for for no reason and they're going to do it again if they get the chance|agent:and if they've you know caused as much pain and|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:twenty twenty two twenty three year old nurses are all dead it just doesn't seem|user:rehabilitated to the point that he can go back out in society when these young|user:that some board is sitting there trying to decide whether he is	he should i think have made that his life should have been sacrificed for what he took	1
agent:on an island so far away there's no chance they can ever get off|user:gotten a little narrow-minded about things like that [laughter]|user:i see they've	yeah	1
agent:and therefore i think juries should be able to recommend sentencing|user:i think i agree with that very much|agent:it's just not right	i do you	1
agent:well now that's possible|user:uh-huh my husband works as a policeman so i always assumed that that was why i was never|agent:i've just never been called up	called uh-huh	1
agent:i suppose it should be|agent:uh|agent:uh well there again	that would mean they all would have to decide	1
agent:uh we can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials|user:um-hum|agent:yes	uh apparently there are i i i since my husband worked as a policeman	0
agent:well they said it w[as]- that this happened during lunch time|user:when people said he was at work|agent:they found him guilty	uh-huh	1
agent:yes unfortunately that's what happens|user:the guilty people the one's that are on trial|user:yeah i guess that's where a lot of the problem lies we're we tr[y]- bend over backwards protecting	and	0
agent:not freedom of action|user:um-hum|agent:the first amendment definitely says freedom of speech	yeah	0
user:and uh i i-|agent:um-hum|user:it's important in so many facets of our life	i feel like if they don't people don't like what our flag stands for	0
user:um|agent:uh i don't know if that's a regular procedure or what|user:that's what i was thinking they they sometimes do	um-hum	1
agent:yeah but too many times they they are per[mitted]- permitted to go out on parole and|user:and a lot of different things i guess|user:you know what they're what they'd been guilty of and	um-hum	0
user:it seemed like there sometimes there's not a good the balance isn't right|agent:um-hum|user:got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody	it doesn't make sense	1
agent:Jean it's been awful nice talking to you|user:so|agent:sure enough	well it's been nice talking to you Jack and uh i hope you have a real good day and week	1

agent:yeah that's great|user:yeah|agent:sounds interesting uh-huh	but dinner parties are a lot of work uh	1
agent:and then you'd simmer it like all day long|user:oh yeah|agent:rice and consume soup uh and bacon and onions	right	0
user:remember we were first married and we were living in New Jersey and uh we were going over to my mother's house for|user:something s[ee]- my wife's from Texas so uh|user:i uh you talked about Thanksgiving there are interesting meals at different times uh	Christmas you know to have a meal	0
user:um-hum|agent:if if you ever get a chance to buy one of those i think it was uh twenty dollars for uh i don't remember how many pounds it was but you cook it in the bag that they send it in and it's all the juices and everything are all sealed in|user:no i- i uh i- i've i know about [vocalized-noise] but i think goes [vocalized-noise]	oh really	1
agent:um-hum|user:has uh you know a truck that comes around and and they recently had hams they have steaks and|user:company that	and uh actually pierogies and all that stuff that uh	0
agent:us teaching them you know the uh the finer points but my mother has really high cholesterol so it was one of the reasons which started them off and they started doing this like in the early or in about the middle seventies|agent:um|agent:it's just it really is they uh they're actually they actually uh uh led us through it versus	yeah	1
user:and you don't really miss it you get the flavor of the yolk|agent:uh-huh uh-huh|user:so i can take not eat the yolk at all	but uh you don't eat it at all you know you don't or hardly you get like uh a bite at at th[e]- the most	0
agent:and there's a mistrial|user:yes and then there's a mistrial right|agent:because too many times they get hung up	uh-huh	1
user:that um|user:and so i'm not you know i agree with you i think that uh|user:and	a majority for uh you know a less severe case would be okay but i think for a death penalty it would be have to be everybody	1
user:i had an experience with that because my i have a brother-in-law that was um|agent:yep|user:and if you they also mentioned about a judge you know doing the verdict well	di[d]- made a mistake and he uh	0
agent:is that there's not consistency|user:because don't|agent:yeah i that's the problem i have with judge giving sentence	exactly	1
user:[noise]|agent:and he cleaned it up it was even cleaner than when he bought it|user:oh my word	isn't that awful	1
agent:top notch lawyers|agent:the uh|agent:the rich people can hire the	right	1
user:and um|user:drunken driving|user:one the one one of the ones that i was came down for was had to do with um	you know i don't think i could be partial in a case like that i ju[st]-	0
agent:and uh i think they|user:[noise]|agent:and they asked if anybody had been ever rear ended to hold their hand up and i had	right away they	1
user:innocent or possibly not as guilty as you know as|user:possibly|user:a person that was uh	as uh you might think would you know get the book thrown at them or whatever because we're all we all feel the same way but	1
agent:yeah|user:oh wouldn't that be awful|agent:the time on the jury plus missing his pay check	yeah that would be terrible	1
agent:[noise] yeah matter of fact it's sort of interesting because_1 they do have uh drug testings at the company i work at|user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	they do all right	1
user:very very hazardous type of uh operation|user:have been involved in companies that have discussed it one of them|agent:um	drilling oil and gas wells	0
user:yeah it at least run a spot check|agent:get the majority of employees that way|user:eventually have everyone	and i think maybe the knowledge that they could have random testing uh may have an effect too	1
user:um-hum|agent:right yeah there are requirements matter of fact i think [vocalized-noise] levied upon the company to have some sort of drug testing [noise]|user:type of government supervision on it uh	yeah	1
user:but|agent:um-hum|user:and we we tend not to know uh we tend to think theoretically	lots of times getting down to the actual method and and results	1
user:the uh|agent:yeah|user:uh	Cherry Blossom Festival apparently went all right	1
user:well the uh|agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum	time limit i think is is about up but i enjoyed talking to you Wayne	1
agent:well i use um a credit card that's given out by US Air|user:um-hum|agent:oh really wow	um-hum	1
agent:and just be totally wiped out because one thing i hate is paying interest|user:um-hum|agent:um and in the beginning we were having a problem because we would charge everything and then get this enormous bill	um-hum	1
agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum|user:yeah i just i don't think to use them all the time [vocalized-noise] and if i do use one i would rather use my Discover card one	and they're getting to the point now too at the end of the year	1
user:uh that's why i have it [laughter]|agent:J C Penney offered you know a free gift if you buy it yeah or five dollars off this purchase if you you know sign up and|agent:but um you know one thing one of the reasons because_1 i have some of those cards that you mentioned and i think about it and and a lot of reason i have those cards is because	uh-huh	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah yeah|agent:yeah	i just rely on my Mac card [laughter]	0
user:um-hum|user:that's good|agent:and they took it right off no questions i just said this isn't my charge if you can prove that it is then great if you can't then um you know just take it off	yeah	0
agent:yeah it's true though because then all they end up doing is spending more of their time making collection calls|user:but i think they should have the the consumer [vocalized-noise] the most interest you know [laughter]|agent:right	it's like they're addicted to	0
user:uh my first thoughts on capital punishment i[s]- i the first thing i want to say i[s]- is no|user:okay|user:[noise]	just simply because we as human beings don't have the right	0
agent:that that i find very difficult to swallow sometimes|user:ex[actly]-|agent:our taxes are paying to feed and shelter those people and it just	uh-huh	0
agent:you know we could be pay[ing]- feeding poor people and helping you know|user:oh exactly|agent:and then when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs	um-hum	1
user:uh apparently two teenage boys held up a Taco Bell|agent:oh exactly w[ell]-|user:to kill somebody or in some cases kill several people at one time uh there was a case in Dallas well i'm sure they haven't gone to court yet but	they put four people in a freezer and shot them_1 all	1
agent:crux of the problem is no one has come up with a solution|agent:but but i think that the whole|user:exactly	um-hum	1
agent:e[xactly]-|user:uh rehabilitation programs of some sort something to get|user:that same money or half of that money could be used towards	to to	0
agent:solutions to the problem|agent:being put into the research of of an alternate|agent:the money that's been budgeted budgeted for new prisons	um-hum	1
agent:right most of us are so sheltered you know|user:uh pain and things and so when we talk about|agent:exactly	yeah	1
agent:uh you want you want to you know persuade people to your viewpoint|agent:just to give the facts because usually on an issue that you really care about|agent:i i'm just i'm just agreeing with you when i think of it how difficult it must be to	um-hum	1
user:it was one of those days where you wish you uh you didn't want to|agent:um-hum|user:uh yeah we've been uh real lucky here	have to go back into work	1
user:yeah i remember those|agent:and uh of course of course summers summers uh i i guess uh once you get {climatized} and i am i mean i kind of look forward to the hundred degrees days ex[cept]- except for the air conditioning bills i i could i could do without the three hundred dollar electric bills|agent:so everything is pretty and green here and we're not really uh and not having to pay money to water	yeah well we've moved into a new house uh at the end of February	0
agent:uh-huh|user:you can put in any number of grasses up here uh a lot people like the red fescue they like to mix red fescue in with uh Kentucky Blue|agent:uh what what do you normally put in up there	um	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and the weeds can't get in there and so you don't have to weed and feed and do all that other crazy stuff you just|agent:yeah	you know the only bad part about it is during the winter the grass is brown but i mean you know	1
agent:i'm i'm aware of that did you have a very severe winter|agent:yeah|user:and it's just absolutely the worst feeling in the whole world	uh not really we had uh a couple uh real good snow storms	0
agent:and uh we're probably some where near normal right now|agent:uh i'm i'm hoping you know you you don't want anything to flood but you want to get normal rain|agent:uh at at this time last year it was it was uh it was pretty bad but	yeah i noticed uh tonight when i was out driving around that the uh the one of the main reservoirs in the county i live in is uh	0
agent:for someone that's been at TI thirty two years this is kind of {unTI} like too [laughter]|user:right|agent:uh in in Dallas it's across LBJ from the main TI site it's three glass buildings and that	[laughter] i had a uh a uh an employee that i hired there Lita Mytek	1
agent:that's Texas like|user:yeah that was a rarity for here|agent:oh that that's Texas like	and God it was just beautiful	1
agent:what a deal|user:because_1 uh i'm you know just got home ready for dinner and and all that and by the time i get done with dinner it's already over and|agent:uh-huh	[laughter-yeah]	1
agent:um-hum|user:you know we get the paper on the weekend|user:as a[s]- as for the rest of but though i don't	and i'll i'll flip through that you know once or twice but not [vocalized-noise] wo[n't]- won't read it cover to cover	1
agent:yeah exactly exactly|user:should've sold [laughter]|agent:but that was uh i believe because of the stockholders' meeting	the building i was in we[ll]- i[t]- guess you work for TI too	1
agent:and he didn't know what he wanted to do he's been with TI for fifteen years|user:yeah|agent:implied or inferred definitely that he has been {surplused} from up there	oh gosh	1
agent:or is not associated|agent:so GD didn't get it|user:and so it was pretty big stuff there then now they got the contract for it so	[vocalized-noise]	0
agent:you know like you know how people throw their change like into uh the glove box or the ash tray of their car and one time we had you know some kids go up and down the street and anybody whose car was open they kind of trashed that stuff out but they didn't do any vandalism and yeah it bugged me but you know when i think of crime and|agent:uh n[o]- n[o]- nothing that i would consider major probably the most that anything of mine has ever been violated is uh|user:[laughter]	uh-huh	1
agent:uh i don't know what the answers should be per se|user:uh-huh|agent:but so you know yeah i i'm not sure there's many lives that aren't affected by it somewhere	yeah you stop and think about what you can do to uh to prevent or reduce crime	0
agent:oh|agent:oh|user:uh employees sale sold once upon a time called Schlage	that's also modular and wireless and you can add as many sensors as you need to	1
agent:i don't know i guess i have a little bit more compassion i do think they ought to have their day in court|agent:[laughter]|user:sometimes that's the best solution i guess	uh-huh	1
user:a lot of a lot of countries do especially smaller third world nations and their governments uh strictly enforce|agent:no we're not|user:well we're not the only country that has a a drug problem [laughter]	uh	1
user:uh i haven't seen any any evidence of uh any uh|user:and and Plano is pretty good about it too they've got excellent uh police force here|agent:i don't know the answers though i i i do wish we had a system that was a bit more fair	mischievous deeds going on in my neighborhood	1
user:okay have a good evening|agent:thank you very much huh you too bye bye|user:yes	sure bye	1
agent:they have varied tremendous|user:it's a|agent:[noise] the few i've been in	uh-huh	0
user:separate any longer|user:live alone you know|user:extremely active and just wishes not to have to	and then there are the uh the nursing homes which actually provide you know nursing care	1
user:that's that's what i would be afraid of i would rather|user:that's true|agent:is what happens	personally i would rather be in a community	0
user:i don't think i would like that i think i would rather|user:provide all your entertainment for you and that would|user:you ha[ve]- you are totally dependent on someone else to	if i were in that situation i think i would rather live in a in a nursing home situation	1
user:frequently not um|user:that's true and and the the nurses that they hire are|agent:and people say well you know they're a nursing home but the hey it doesn't work that way they're a business	the most qualified in their field	1
agent:literally and positively terrified|agent:scared and everybody else didn't want her she was terrified of one|agent:she wouldn't go in a nursing home besides being	yeah	1
user:and she couldn't drive but heck but she'd never learned to drive to begin with so|user:she was still [vocalized-noise] household independent she was independent in the household you know in the home|user:[noise]	i mean it wasn't	0
user:she's still real independent so|agent:oh she drives yeah|agent:[noise]	i think that for so many people	0
user:they've been uprooted for some reason or another|user:i've seen a lot of people that don't live near their family or don't have you know significant roots in this in their little community|user:but uh	and they i i think that it would be good for them to be into a situation that	1
agent:care and put them in a home to where it's regulated|agent:you know i don't know they c[an]- if they can have day care why can't they put elderly people|agent:i wish i had enough money to go down there and do something but	yeah	1
user:yet|user:and uh|user:and they cherish them	i mean we as Americans are such a throw away society	1
user:or most of them have and|user:and uh|user:my relatives have lived very long full lives	as a result i have uh	1
agent:yeah|user:i know the bigger cities have problems with it|user:um	[noise]	0
agent:and they don't really|agent:especially like in date rape many of the um you know perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up|agent:oh okay because one of the things that i've heard so much about l[ately]- um lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much and apparently many of the	well not only that a lot of them's not even turned in	0
agent:yeah|user:see see now i would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything|user:uh	i know a lot of people	1
agent:yeah|agent:okay|user:no i can't say that i- i just know that it's really bad in some areas and something's going to have to be done sooner but	i don't i don't know what they can do	1
agent:that's a shame|user:[laughter-so]|agent:oh well	and and uh	0
agent:[laughter]|user:because they ask me why are there two bridges going into Dallas|agent:yeah	darned if i know [laughter] i was blank looking you know i felt really dumb	1
agent:um-hum|user:because i am pretty sure where the TV plot's going|agent:yeah	but	0
agent:[laughter]|user:i guess the awards ceremonies and there seems to be dozens of them per year|user:um	maybe i've spent two minutes watching to see what they have on and if they make a fool of themselves or not	0
agent:personally i i came from the Washington area and so i was a big Washington Redskins fa[n]-|agent:i|agent:i uh	oh	0
agent:rationalized that it's it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see|agent:i've kind of uh|agent:so i	well	1
agent:do go through my mail and and watch TV at the same time|agent:and look over things and i can sit in front of the TV set and look at you know|agent:so i kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and	well	0
agent:oh uh one about_1 a month ago after twenty one years two miles to the east|agent:just moved here about uh|user:yeah	oh is that right	1
agent:so it's got a lot a o[penness]- o[penness]- openness and light also|user:sun room on the back of it|user:a big	it	1

agent:really|user:but they didn't do a great job of changing my transmission uh oil last time and when when i did it the next time|user:i was pretty impressed with Western Auto	i realized the filter was loose and everything and i didn't like it So i'm just doing it all myself i i	1
agent:oil f[ilter]- uh cap off and it was rubbing on a belt and it rubbed a notch in that li[ttle]- little things like that that really start to aggravate you that that's a lot of the reason i do my own stuff|agent:and they had left the uh|agent:yeah we ran into some problems with uh having them to work on that carburetor i mean they get they got everything tuned up right you know but they we got i got it home and uh	really	1
agent:yeah|agent:oh yeah|agent:yeah	i bought one car new	0
agent:you better figure on multiplying that time out about by at least by five or so|agent:then it's experience you know you can you can look through a a Chilton's book or something like that and get an idea of how to go about it but|agent:but	yeah	1
agent:yeah ye[ah]- yeah and it was it was leaking inside the car in the condenser unit so uh they they did a little patch on it|user:this is your little water uh heater in there for the uh the heat inside|agent:they thought they could patch it up a little bit you know and what not so they	yeah	1
agent:sure|agent:uh-huh|user:you know pull on that and i've always done that as a kid you know just yanked on it and they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time	but i broke one on my on my Buick and i always remembered it was my own fault and i thought well i'm going to to going to carefully take those hoses off	1
user:and i went out there for five minutes and i just pushed on the wires And sure enough just pure dumb luck|agent:uh-huh|user:air conditioning stopped i i just heard it i realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in	that the connection over by it's not the evaporator the big filter on one side	0
agent:[noise]	all right you want to start out	1
agent:here basically you go to an Italian restaurant or you go to a Mexican restaurant you know where you can get foods that|user:uh-huh|agent:yeah i think maybe if you were somewhere like California where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants and stuff but	um-hum	1
agent:definitely and it it makes you more aware of what you're eating because you you have to be i mean you you [vocalized-noise] i think you|user:do you feel that it has improved the way you feel|agent:so	you think	1
agent:don't uh the the lactose that kind of milk it doesn't our we we tend to uh what's it called we don't synthesize the the calcium the same way|user:uh-huh|user:is that right	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah well now i changed for ethical reasons and my husband|agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:after you have been on this [vocalized-noise] ye[ah]-	uh-huh	1
agent:you know and that that's the way i and i believe you me it wasn't easy to [laughter-give] [laughter-up] to give up a hamburger that that was one of my favorite foods was|user:um-hum oh yeah yeah|user:um-hum	[laughter] [noise]	1
agent:oh yes|user:so you would have a little more trouble when you were looking for a dining area than what most|user:um-hum	most people would	0
user:and uh|agent:um-hum|user:um-hum what the quality because a lot of them are the same no matter where you stop	we do do that a lot	1
user:it|agent:oh i see uh-huh|user:uh L I T E like uh uh things that aren't as heavy a meal	that you get more uh fruit and	1
user:they have so much food|user:uh well they'll serve you at your seat and u[sually]- usually the salad bar is included so you have to get up for that but|user:now for instance we we had a Scout dinner last night we went to and it's it's they	that you not matter how hard you try to restrain yourself you end up eating	0
user:um-hum|agent:just for food it does seem like it|user:i think that's a waste of my money	um-hum	1
agent:yeah|user:you're full you know you're satisfied|agent:[laughter]	but you don't feel stuffed and miserable	1
user:um-hum|agent:um well it some people could probably do it themselves uh i'm not one of those [laughter]|user:oh yeah well now this certainly isn't something that you could do yourself is it or would want too	yeah i'm not about the only thing i can do mechanically with a	0
user:but|agent:especially for four hundred bucks [laughter]|agent:um	well i didn't know see that's part of the problem you if you're not aware and um	1

agent:into a savings account and they'll do like what you mentioned about matching it and that sort of thing|agent:it's a nice little savings account and then they they tell you if you'd like you can put the money that you save by not paying taxes|agent:but uh	yeah	1
agent:i don't know|user:well|agent:some weeks you're just going to go over that and some weeks you're going to go under and so to me it's just easier to	there again we both have the natural tendency to save	0
agent:and they get themselves into some deep trouble|agent:and they get them and then these kids start charging and|agent:[vocalized-noise] automatic approval	oh yeah	1
agent:and to me i- i try and forget that we even have that because i don't want to think|user:oh|agent:and you just have to pay for it so it's an emergency fund but when we got married we you know obviously got some money and that that's what's put in the CD	yeah	1

agent:that it that it amounts to uh what kind of vacation policy how long have you been with your company Bill|agent:and and i- i think that's the type of thing that uh uh|user:yes i think so	i've been there thirty two years	1
agent:and four weeks over fifteen|agent:you get a full four weeks yeah yeah we get two weeks after a year uh uh three thr[ee]- three weeks between five and fifteen|user:so by the time you've been there twenty years you get the four weeks	hum okay	1

user:as far as this [noise] that good or bad or what but uh i was just talking to somebody else and|user:you know what uh|user:yeah its tough to to say what um	all those European countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that	1
user:you know we do have the education is that|user:i think the pro[gram]- you know that's one reason uh|agent:but that would come down	what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board uh	1
user:paralegals and stuff i mean they they're trying to get more people into that field|user:even like one one of the biggest things now is like|user:but uh	but they can't just bring somebody in	1
user:you know they want somebody you know when they then when they bring them off|user:the time in|user:uh my perspective is that you know i've been with a couple of big companies now and it's like they'd are unwilling to put	bring them in that they have something you know a certain amount to contribute	0
agent:[laughter] wow [laughter]|user:okay|agent:yes	an[d]-	1
agent:they've had it|agent:there's a lot of people that don't want their higher education as far as quote quote college is concerned|agent:because they don't have any education i don't mean college and i'm for college but	yeah i think i just heard something the other day it was like only	1
user:and they|user:that demographic area there you know a lot of them do go on|user:yeah so i think uh	go to college etcetera	1

user:uh the mon[ey]- you know money being spent and the goods flow in and we don't sell you know we don't uh|user:there is such a demand here the market you know and uh|user:they're in [noise] i think you're you're going to find that just because the United States you know	sell products abroad as much as we bring in so	1
user:i know a lot of people that|user:no i don't i don't know i lived in the Middle East for sometime and i- i do believe there must have been some sort of quota system because uh|user:um-hum	were in a sense	0

agent:and and they have|user:right right may[be]-|agent:they uh don't want to work for anything they want it to come to them but and be there but they don't want to work hard and these kids work really hard	but maybe part of that's the problem that here we've we've let this value slip	1
user:um-hum|agent:you know um welcom[ing]- welcoming everyone that wants to come here and even when i was younger wh[en]- when i was in college i was a member of the NAACP because_1 i lived up north and i was very into that the human rights part of everything|agent:i i've i've always prided [laughter-myself] on not being prejudice and being	um-hum	1

agent:and i don't like to have to strain my eyes and try to see the characters on the screen that that was one i- i watched on a video at home and i maybe that was it maybe [vocalized-noise]|agent:i guess|user:well that's true i think that was the feel that they they were after was everything was really dark and and and kind of foreboding and	yeah	1
agent:trying to kill [laughter-him] [laughter]|user:and she finally trying uh i mean it gets from from little things like throwing things at him and dropping things on him to to where she's actually|agent:[laughter] yeah	trying to kill him and then i almost got real furious	0

user:yeah yeah i feel like there should be some kind coverage made but i i am really leery of um [noise]|agent:that would be a nice thing|user:yeah	kind of a government administrative health insurance or medical plan because i just feel like everything the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly and it's going to be about six times more expensive as	0
agent:yeah i mean like we have an an HMO that allows us to pick our own physicians|user:it's getting worse isn't it [laughter] yeah|agent:there are some pla[ces]-	right right	1
agent:free major medical to all you know to everyone and then|agent:right i mean even something that said you know look|agent:yeah and it would be nice to to see something where at least	yeah	1
agent:yeah that is a big problem|user:so is i gue[ss]- yeah i think that's the legal part it coming in to too that|agent:i made a mistake and this is this is fair compensation not	i wonder if we should have a limit on how much people can sue for	0

user:well it's kind of it's kind of moved up and you have to remember that it it it|agent:last year it was DC i guess Baltimore caught them|user:so far this year i think they've got over a hundred dead already this year	uh there's i think X number of people out there that are going to commit murders	1
agent:much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are|agent:and i think our courts should be geared|user:yeah	yeah	1

user:within an hour|user:convicting him on some of the charges but i mean when it all came down they just|user:were a little hesitant on	decided the man's fate	1
user:yeah|agent:you know you never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not|agent:that	yeah i agree	1
user:i mean kidnapping per se has a certain uh|user:um you know when they|user:kidnapping	uh	0

user:finance charges and they just and then they'll pay the minimum balance every month and then end up|user:spend uh they think because they've got a thousand dollar limit then you know they've got to get that limit every month or something and uh they end up paying|user:it's really you know like you said some people go off half wild and	they may have got something on sale but all the interest you know	1
agent:so i don't have to you know worry about it one way of the other and i just keep that minimum balance in there|user:oh okay|agent:if i write a check real large it'll go ahead and pull it out of my savings account	okay i see	1
agent:to get your money out or the credit union all you have to do is put it in the machine one way or the other|agent:the little piece of plastic for uh|agent:well it's like um	uh-huh	1

user:like some people not a spendthrift and i really have to think about my purchases and|user:the end of the year thing so i messed that up so i you know i'm still not in it's not a good habit to use it but fortunately i'm not uh|user:on uh	i know if i have money in the checking account to cover it	0
agent:right|user:and that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way but it's a lot you know it's not too strenuous and i could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything but i don't know what i did to my knee i|agent:yeah	was crawling under a desk hooking up a computer	0
agent:sure|agent:uh-huh uh-huh|agent:well it's	uh it's not anything i would want to but i can really tell the difference since i have not been able to walk i have got to be so much more careful with what i do	0

user:um that was that was one of the problems and|user:yeah so in that particular school system|agent:[laughter]	i guess one of the reasons the administrators uh were	0
user:than some other people too|user:you're more uh fluent in other things the things that you're interested in|user:i'm sure you're	uh	1
user:and the same thing with the fourth i had learned it|user:when i was in the second grade i knew just about everything that was there i had learned it from the first grade|user:looking back at it now that	so it's the amount of teaching you get i think uh	1
agent:okay yeah we had um|user:so how was your high school did they have with the split out like some people were going to college so they took certain courses and some people were|agent:uh-huh	shop	1
user:and that's only because of|user:same book same teacher|agent:um-hum	our school system but as far as English	0
user:a couple of the people that i|user:yeah i work with uh|agent:really	i work with you know share the same office are doing that they've pulled their children out	1
user:so he's getting away with it so is it is it his fault|agent:yeah uh-huh yeah he just has the same outlines year after year|user:so when he files his lesson plans for the year he just he just drags out the old ones and just files them and nobody even looks at them and all that is fine and	or is it	1
user:yeah|agent:oh well you know they've even done stuff like that our teachers are now telling us that these do you know apply they [vocalized-noise] please fill them out properly you know we are really are using them they tell us that but we don't see [laughter-any] you know|user:yet the administration's not looking at the evaluations	what do you think uh can be done	1
user:you know then see what you're going to do|user:let's go on strike|user:and we're not getting it	it'll create a lot of headlines that's for sure	1
agent:well do you think though that i mean if you have to wait seven days in order to purchase a gun are they really going to do these background checks and and if they really|user:how it doesn't it does inconvenience you but it could save lives i think is the way we look at it here and we're seeing so many murders um [noise] between uh in in Washington DC|agent:uh-huh	well i think the i think the long run is is to get um	0
agent:yeah but what what's going to happen to the uh purchasing of guns illegally i meant i meant the guy who shot Brady was he ha[d]- he purchased his gun many months before he actually committed the deed|user:um until they can do it automatically on a large computerized system [noise]|user:gun purchases or whatever	oh sure [noise] that's	1
user:um-hum [noise] and everybody's differences of opinion are probably good that's what makes our|agent:[noise] yeah that's true|user:what we think will make it a better society	you know	1
user:um-hum|agent:you know i meant i- i still keep my gun and you keep your gun if you have one|agent:but it doesn't uh won't do anything to uh in other words step if they	yeah	1
agent:but how would how would any[one]- how would how if i went to buy a gun and and i had been under the care of a psychologist for the last ten years how would they have a record of that|user:you know but you have to wait seven|user:yeah see and in the back of my mind if we save one life if if you save one life you have to wait seven days probably less because if you have a clean record it probably would be faster than seven days	you have to wait	1
agent:sure would be nice to feel safe again wouldn't it|agent:yeah|user:no it's far less than what we have in the United States we're like the murder capital of the world [noise] in the civilized world you know above third world countries	yeah [noise] and i don't know it's it's just who knows it's an argument i guess	1
agent:sure|user:then you uh would you please uh tell me how you do it|user:and i'll tell you what they are and uh	i think i keep up better	0

user:all our responsibility to|user:hunker down and do something about it but you know it's like we we we have all the needs that you know a civilized society has and i think that it's not|user:i think we all just sort of have to	to do that i mean th[e]- the the manufacturers wou[ld]- would manufacture things in ways that were biodegradable and did not damage the the the environment you know i think that it would be a plus for them and more people would buy more of those products	1
user:alright|agent:okay [laughter] bye-bye|user:please do	bye	1
user:sure|agent:that's i mean the other problem is there's so many guns out there if you ban sales of guns right now there'd still be millions and millions and millions of them_1|agent:yeah that [noise]	uh	1
user:they're they're not uh buying guns to commit any crimes at all just|agent:yeah|user:and a lot of people own guns just as a hobby and uh hunters in particular	uh uh pursuing their hobby	0

user:yeah|agent:and fam[ily]- the the old family structure of the mothers and the grandmothers and the grandfathers maybe even some great grandparents occasionally that seems to have been broken apart pretty pretty well including the family structure as a unit itself|user:um-hum that's true	yeah it doesn't seem the norm to have uh have parents and and uh the two what two point five kids and all that uh	1
agent:uh major about face in terms of the way we conduct war and the way we|agent:we have uh made uh uh uh a a rather|agent:and what all we went through there in terms of what's happened in the Iraqi situation it seems like uh	um-hum	1
agent:i think in the Vietnam era uh and that uh Congress should have stayed out of it much as possible|user:um-hum|agent:and uh it just goes to give me a a a feeling that uh we did some things wrong	um-hum	1
agent:and uh i'll give you an example i was talking about i've said for years because_1 i- i my background's in physics|user:um-hum|agent:has not really kept abreast of what's going on industrially	um-hum	1

agent:yeah|agent:um-hum|user:keeping them up you know doing the maintenance and everything on them [noise] as long as we didn't have to do it very often	[noise] but once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them_1 [noise] all of them_1 you know [noise] it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for [laughter-them_1] [laughter]	1
agent:that the[se]- tho[se]- these companies have put into their procurement and it's [vocalized-noise] uh it's come about as a result of the competition from the Japanese|agent:and there is a amazing i am just uh really impressed with the with the quality consciousness|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:oh yeah yours is small [laughter]|agent:hm|user:our our k[ids]- we won't have anymore licensed drivers for about thirteen years [laughter] yes [noise] so we um so we don't plan on purchasing anymore anytime soon both of our cars	are getting	0
agent:yeah and uh uh you know you you figure out the options go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and and tell him what you want and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy a certain person at that dealer's place so i'm gonna try that the next time i buy one|user:really|agent:and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way	um-hum	1
agent:last [laughter-Saturday] and uh uh and i- i find that uh|user:goodness|agent:is all we paid for cars in those days [noise] and uh uh so i called back the guy in Dallas and i told him that i'd left him a check for tax title and license and everything [noise] and i said i wanna cancel my order and and don't try to cash the check because_1 i'm gonna i've stopped payment on it already and he says oh somebody's taking he said what did you get a deal for Bill and i told him he says somebody's taking you for a ride and i said no somebody took me for a [laughter-ride]	that's right	1

agent:yep|agent:uh-huh|user:or done their very you know given their best effort at doing that	i i don't care to support them	1
user:now that's tougher|agent:uh-huh|user:that that put that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person's guilty	it's easier to say it on the telephone and everyone agree that yeah the death penalty's the way to go it's a deterrent to crime they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway but to be the actual one of the ones that decide that would be tougher for me	1
user:[laughter]|agent:well anyhow i guess we both agree that that it is it should be in effect|agent:yeah exactly	hang them_1 [laughter-yeah] [laughter] yeah i agree it should be in effect also i agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement uh so i guess i would say i want it to be in effect but i want	1
agent:oh oh yes yes i i believe it's any capital crime related to drugs i think that's the way it's worded|user:and they they are in effect killing people|agent:uh-huh	oh okay is that how it's worded	0

user:[noise]	okay Jean um could you tell me what you what you think about uh gun control	1
agent:i really don't personally feel that it's going to help|agent:a stronger restrictions is going to stop a person who really wants to have one for misuse|agent:i- i just i just don't feel that uh	no unless it's a like one of those automatic weapons	1
agent:i just i really don't believe that|user:no no what i|agent:are going to keep them from getting them if they really want one	what i think should happen is uh any violent crime	0

agent:did a|agent:yeah he was interested in that then uh|user:oh isn't that good yeah	so what is he	0
agent:they had a few more restrictions there|user:ah okay|agent:that he shot in and	[noise]	0
user:uh|user:i think that uh|user:if they followed the rules and regulations and the laws that were already in place	that would suffice we wouldn't have to go any further we wouldn't have to put more regulations out there	1
agent:i would go along with that|user:probably a six i would go with|user:i kind of think uh	uh that's	1
user:uh i've got three|agent:yeah|user:and a newer model something looks a little nicer	children at home two [vocalized-noise] fourteen year olds and a twelve year old	0
agent:um-hum which is the one that has modular type seats you know which one i'm talking about they have the commercial on TV where you can you can pull some seats out and you can move around|agent:yeah yeah|user:and because if you get the seven passenger version [laughter] you can put some space between the kids [noise] and uh i think that would that would serve us well plus it's got uh good storage capacity in it for you know taking things along going to the store	um-hum	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and just have the three seats in the back and the two seats up front|user:now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out	or you can take the uh three seat out and just use the two seat or you can take the two seat and move the two seat to the back	0
user:one of the things|user:and dropping the prime is probably|agent:yeah	i just bought a new house so	0

agent:seventy thousand miles on it and we thought that was a little bit too much to pay for|agent:we didn't feel the at at the time the residual was like sixty five hundred dollars and it was a four year old car with|agent:um and the only reason why we ended up not buying it was because	yeah	1
agent:uh-huh|user:haven't taken the time to learn the fundamentals of the game|user:i just uh	i just go out and try to be Joe Athlete	0

agent:right|user:they're they're interested in keeping their records accurate|user:and	but uh it's just nice to make sure that no uh	1
user:and he [laughter-had] a heck of a time convincing the authorities that|user:and he didn't have any children|user:for uh failure to provide child support	he wasn't the	0
user:because of the uh|user:uh one of the biggest change in in uh the role of women in the last two generations is the fact that|user:okay i uh i think in general that the the	probably the [laughter-national] [laughter-debt] [laughter-as] [laughter-a] matter of fact but the uh impossibility of	0
user:it has uh|user:right|agent:oh i i'd agree with you i think that is one of the big big changes	uh	0
agent:um-hum|user:uh it just does not have the same kind of opportunities as the one who does|agent:um-hum	that's the kind of uh	0
user:they feel|user:most of them_1 uh do things because they either want attention or because they|user:as opposed to too much ego	that they're not worthy	0
agent:yeah|user:instead of discourage it|agent:yeah	instead of giving you a break so that maybe a wife could stay home and do	0
user:so that they can their children can go there so that they can see them so that they can have this|agent:um-hum|user:in uh um [noise] a workplace	uh you know during lunchtime or whatever	0
agent:they have more freedom|user:all these things i think in uh in a person's life there are a lots of|agent:um-hum	right and there are lots of of stages of your life where you can do things that you didn't do	0
agent:right yeah i th[ink]- i'm|user:where the husband is comfortable|user:if you can get a relationship like that but where the	doing those things because children badly need more of that	0
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:i mean i remember when i was little my friends uh my parents i'm sorry would just go over people's houses and just sort of you know sit and talk and before TV and all that people would sit and listen to the radio and and that i mean life has just changed and become so much more modernized and	uh it's really pretty incredible	1
agent:it's too bad|user:i know|user:uh-huh	i know	0
user:uh-huh|agent:because like uh i'm really glad that i'm in like uh the classes uh like honors classes and so it's like what's really good about that is that you meet people who really are interested in in talking about things and discussing world issues and it just and it makes me sick to go to school and|agent:a lot of times we do sit around and	yes	0
agent:yeah|user:it's amazing i mean i don't know if you'll always have a car around that's a different issue|user:i mean suddenly when you're free to go where you want to go	but um	1

agent:you know because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want|agent:and uh or they fool the the defense in thinking that they're|user:um-hum um-hum	oh of course it's it's political maneuvering the the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will you know	0
agent:[laughter]|user:they will they will eventually|agent:i would love to be ca[lled]- i'm ready to go [laughter] they just haven't called me up yet [laughter]	[laughter] okay well it was nice talking with you	0
agent:are you going to do it over a weekend or|user:the what|agent:are you going to do it over a weekend	well interesting enough we're going to we're going to do it over an eight day period	0
user:uh so it's kind of once more combining the whole group again|agent:uh-huh|user:uh groups my the grandfathers and the great grandfathers	but uh it's it's it's uh it requires a lot of uh logistics for food for the people who will have to meet	0
user:and then there will be uh|user:a pretty good size area where there'll be hiking and|user:and uh and it's a	oh just uh general kinds of things like uh swimming and	0
user:and uh|user:we're real excited about it now always before we have only had my grandfather's family|user:so it it	we only did it for one day	0
user:uh so that maybe they'd be attracted more to bring their families|agent:um-hum|user:while getting to know their ancestors and relatives	now i've never gotten all my family to come before but this year i have uh several married daughters and	0
user:and so uh at that point we were going for that reason we were going there|agent:uh-huh|user:but uh and there's one other wife but all of the all of the children are now gone they they've passed away in the meantime	but it just there just more of them there still than there are other places the rest of us are kind of strung around some but we['re]- but you know if you	0
agent:how|user:so we might do something like that also sometimes universities will|user:uh activities and things like that	will rent out uh	0
agent:right|user:you know they have to plan their vacations that far ahead a little bit|user:uh at least a year ahead of time or you're going to lose people	if not exactly at least know generally what they're going to do	1
user:but|agent:wow sounds like you guys are uh your family's really into family|user:help them get better acquainted and mostly it's a different kind of thing so we're we're just kind of playing it by ear and seeing how it goes i think	[laughter] yeah we're kind of like we kind of uh	0
agent:it too it's it was a large transition let me tell you because_1 they had to meet one person they only had to meet me and i had to probably meet twenty five or thirty people|user:do you do you enjoy your do you enjoy your your wife's large family though|agent:not very many no	was it is it	1
user:yeah|agent:once ever two years and and it's about a you know ten people show up so no one there's my age so i just kind of sit there and hang out|agent:because our family has a reunion about	yeah yeah	1
agent:a Ford Explorer|agent:ok[ay]-|user:okay what did you buy	i'm sorry what	1
agent:what's wrong with the Volvo|user:or either that or Mercedes just because they're put together so well it seems like they last forever|user:i don't know i from what	oh i don't know they're they're not as nice looking	1
user:i like|user:i don't know|user:but uh	my actual favorite cars -[i]s were uh like the Ford	0
agent:i mean you're sitting up on top of everything and you can really see real well and i just it's it's so comfortable and|agent:but the Explorer|user:really	uh-huh	1
user:uh Cougar and he's never had any problem with it either so|user:um my Mercury or my Cou[gar]- my husband has a|user:American cars a lot of people say they they don't last long but i've never had any problem with	[noise] i don't know	1
agent:they're still concerned about my attitude and it it will never change about that place and uh|agent:and and uh i've written a a letter to Middlekauff and i've told them_1 that matter of fact i got another letter last night from the Quality Ford Division|agent:[noise] their just their attitude is just slimy	[laughter]	1
agent:so ha[ve]- have you been using well anyway|user:i've heard some stuff about them but um|user:so	what	1
user:uh-huh|agent:well it it some i think it depends on uh you know what the ho[w]- the cloud cover and like right now it's uh [noise] it's kind of overcast you know just it's hot and the sun is trying tries to shine through but it it's it's holding in this this pollution and i-|user:how bad is it do you have smog like they do in California	hm depends_1 on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion i take	0
agent:um-hum|user:that uh there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles but it's mostly from older automobiles i don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting|user:i think a lot of it's industrial i also think uh	uh frankly i think that uh	0
user:okay|agent:oh uh-huh|user:fro[m]- from cars that is not f[rom]- not total but just from cars	so that i think would be a tremendous help and i happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical and it just keeps getting uh gives me good service and i don't have an incentive to get rid of it long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money	0
user:and uh|user:and|user:industrial is what i really uh believe is the the main problem	and uh uh	0
user:for just all kinds|user:in terms of uh cancer rate|user:and i think this state was like second this year from the top	and i can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution	0
agent:but it doesn't have anything that's damaging|user:right|agent:even uh so so the aerosol is still aerosol	no they they they m[ade]- passed a law and made them_1 take fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers	0
agent:is that right|agent:you really oh|user:and she spot checks people's trash and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your [laughter-trash]	they'll fine you fifty bucks i think the first time and two fifty the second time	1
user:and uh that can help to cut pollution i guess some i- i don't know how much|agent:um-hum|user:get along with your environment and help it out is a very very important thing	trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air	0
user:and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said somebody happened to stay up late night or something i don't think we have a adequate policing|user:that uh that i think may go on a lot|agent:you know goes on	uh esp[ecially]- particularly on industry	0
user:i think it's a good idea the emissions check though is required in Maryland and it's also required in Virginia|user:and i think that's a good idea too not no[t]- not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution n[ecessarily]- necessarily but|agent:we do that ev[ery]- every year	uh a sister state to to this	0
user:but water pollution uh|user:uh hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of uh pollutants in our food|user:but i think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this country so	i've worried uh especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like	0
agent:spring and it was like ice cold spring water and i guess parts of the the city still ha[ve]- you know get that but|user:yeah|agent:when we were when i was growing up i lived in Huntsville Alabama and their water supply came from uh	uh-huh	1
agent:[noise] that's true very definitely so|agent:um-hum|user:uh the source of supply the problem is here but the source [laughter-of] supply is there	in fact i think a lot of the i've been	0
agent:um-hum|user:native|user:uh	Latin Americans come down from the hills you can't imagine what poor is and uh the worst scene i've ever had i think was uh [noise]	0
user:expensive uh holdings and all that and the ambassador said but i know what you make as a US senator how can you afford all of this|user:home was palatial an[d]- they had five or six servants you know and and a lot of|user:home for dinner and the uh	and he said come i'll show you and he walked out in the backyard and	0
agent:yep [laughter] intentions intentions [laughter]|user:and the ambassador [potted/patted] patted his pocket and said one hundred percent|user:he said you see that hospital over there and the senator looked and he couldn't see anything he said no	so [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-it] it's a sad story but	1
user:the unpreparedness|user:and it shows the|agent:yes	for such such a problem	0
agent:they don't want it i mean [laughter-that's] [laughter-kind] [laughter-of] [laughter-a]|agent:they want it but|agent:help from us	you're	0
agent:you know they they know that by pumping that poison into our system|agent:well and i think that you know uh it somewhat a sarcastic view but i'm sure that some of those drugs czars|user:government uh situation too	um-hum	1
user:the grower in Columbia and|user:which would still give the uh|user:than they are in trying to to beef up the military and to do all other things i think it'd be cheaper to buy it and destroy it	elsewhere in Latin America	1
agent:[noise]|user:[laughter-all] [laughter-right] thank you Salina bye|user:very good [laughter]	[noise]	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh|user:you know i would say go ahead and execute that person as well	but it's the cases you know like sometimes you you know you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely you know they really didn't do it well you know	0
user:uh-huh|agent:any reason i don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it [noise]|agent:i don't know [noise] i think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for	exactly	0
user:uh-huh|user:[laughter]|agent:oh yeah [laughter] they're always doing it in Florida Florida and Louisiana i think and uh some of the other southern states	yeah	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh|user:it's like a slap on the fingers for them	i don't i don't	1
agent:but some of these guys just don't care you know|agent:off earlier|user:yeah	[laughter]	1
agent:more urban i mean less|agent:the the more|user:uh-huh	see yeah okay well see i'm i'm in kind i'm	0
agent:very old uh historical place there|user:oh i never heard of that|agent:uh	it might have a new name	1
agent:because they know that the judge you know if they find them guilty is you know has the the opportunity to sentence them you know for for the death sentence|agent:pleading or whatever|agent:they uh there's less criminals that are you know turning themselves in or you know	yeah but you know i look at that and say well they should have thought about that beforehand	1
user:[noise]	so child care your views	1
user:regulate|user:they are they seem to|user:whenever	the good toward the bad instead of bad toward the good	1
user:and|agent:uh-huh|user:ten now	most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma	1
user:in her home|agent:uh-huh|user:and after school you know kindergartners or half-dayers	and they would read and play	1
agent:i don't know if the resources are the proper term you know just the the know knowledge of who's a available then you could probably find some really good care|agent:i guess if you have the opportunity to pick and choose and you've got the time and that uh|agent:that	uh yeah but i don't know that it would be state approved	1
user:meets|user:child care|user:now here i believe that	by and large certain standards for	1
user:of of working adults for|user:number|user:being defined as	number of	1
user:i really believe that this|user:yet|user:and uh	charismatic	1
user:the care is what|user:uh|user:and	i guess you should emphasize in the term child care instead of the child	1
agent:and -[u]sually that's done through example not you know an actual sit down learn situation so|agent:promote politeness and niceness you know the things that you would want any child to learn|agent:child's day care person to yell at them and scream at them and say do this do that you know you'd want them to	uh yeah uh	1
agent:i know i i did that for summer so i can i can vouch for [laughter-that]|agent:yeah|user:their employees earn almost nothing	and and that's really a a shame too because	1
user:more and more|user:but|agent:right	we're being forced into a situation we as Americans are being forced into a situation	1
agent:well we vacation a lot how about you [laughter] quite frequently [laughter]|user:so|agent:okay	[laughter]	0
agent:uh-huh|user:seems like i do a lot in the Midwest lately um my um [noise] my fiancee's family's from Wisconsin|user:well it really depends i mean uh	and so we've been out there a couple of times and um	0
agent:ever go up in Pennsylvania in the mountains or|user:and um|user:that's about it we don't i mean we do a lot of little trips around here um	not that much we've gone out to um	0
user:hum|agent:to Williamsburg and spent a night|agent:with a friend in Portsmith and then went	spend a day and a lot of money [laughter]	0
user:um-hum|agent:we've done it a couple of times and that's enough for us [laughter] probably another twenty years [laughter]|user:um	yeah i was um we use it live in California and um my um up up around San Francisco and um	0
agent:right|user:so we basically had run of the park um|agent:uh-huh	Disneyland i mean there's still a lot of people at Disneyland but there was another um [noise] another amusement park down there Busch Gardens	0
agent:oh okay that w[ould]- yeah that would be really nice|user:that's Door County [laughter] [laughter] so|agent:uh-huh	[vocalized-noise]	0
agent:oh i see|user:most of whom are like me that work in in speech labs that are going to use the data base eventually|user:most people talk to Texas there's been a couple of other the people um	so	0
user:yeah um|user:just|agent:oh does she yeah that's nice out there	we keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the summer and it's never really works [laughter-out]	1
agent:not too much into sports|user:oh|agent:no huh-uh nope	except our outside [vocalized-noise] though	1
agent:[vocalized-noise]|agent:Buccaneers oh okay|user:Buccaneers	yeah um	0
user:okay|agent:was a loud one|user:[noise]	[laughter] uh where do you stand on gun control	1
agent:that's correct i don't know how maybe i- that's|user:when i go out somewhere because there's so many people they're crazy people out there|user:the drug war is not is not helping and i feel like i have to protect myself	you know and so	1
agent:i mean you know and|user:wow|agent:and you stand in an alley down there and buy anything you want	uh-huh	1
user:i want to protect myself but at the same time|user:i mean it it|user:the reason i think i'm so cloudy on the issue is because	i don't want anyone to have a gun that could harm me	1
user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:that's true unless of course there was you know su[fficient]- sufficient provocation which we have basically the same thing now|user:but everyone weren't they weren't going around killing each other	trouble yeah	1
user:right now i have a knife under the seat in my car|agent:well if you get one you know|user:it just scares me to have one but i feel like that very soon i'm going to have to go get one just because i would probably feel safer	uh if i'm going anywhere at night anywhere i mean if i'm just stepping outside my door i carry something on me if i'm you know going up to my door and i don't have anything i put my keys in some kind of weapon like position in my hand	0
user:yeah|user:you know uh but you have to|agent:well it's a sad state of affairs when have to but uh you know they're are more and more homes are getting broken into and everybody says well	uh-huh	1
agent:oh yeah but you know where where are the most crimes committed New York state|user:oh do they|agent:now New Jersey had the stiffest gun laws	really um-hum	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah they're people doing that so i mean the the solution is not to pass more laws than you can't enforce because they're they're going to pass one now they're trying too either the Staggers Bill or the Brady Bill|agent:and there are peop[le]-	uh-huh	1
agent:oh yeah it's uh it's quite a deal|agent:if you|user:i didn't know baseball bats was like that huh	uh	1
agent:makes about as much sense|user:very true|agent:and they said well let's band the public telephones too because the public telephones are used in the commission of drug related crimes	a lot of sense	1
user:you know|agent:there's an application you fill out now|user:what do you think about making some kind of application or something	do you okay	1
agent:uh yes i do full time|user:[noise] are do you work outside the home	and do you have small children	1
agent:right|user:i i'm not in a field that is typically a man's field i'm not a surgeon i'm not a doctor um|agent:oh uh-huh	and so i- i haven't	0
agent:you know so she's|agent:but she couldn't cry in front of them because they'd do it more|agent:things that would just make her cry at work	yeah	1
agent:right|user:somewhere between a nurse and a doctor|agent:uh-huh	and i	0
agent:right|user:and their cul[ture]- i i'm talking about the ones who came from Mexico not the ones that were reared in the states|agent:yeah	i'm talking primarily about um you know the the guys that are over here on work thesis	0
agent:in other words if you wouldn't of had|agent:uh-huh|user:i don't see how i can ever get back on track i don't see that as being a possibility i will i will never work	seventy hour weeks again	1
user:i- i you know it's it's i mean i love what i do|agent:yeah|user:i don't even think i would go interview again	but	0
user:of of what's not being uh you know uh|user:i'm afraid of what|agent:y[eah]- right	di[scussed]- discussed with them or what	0
user:[noise] um|user:uh that they see routinely that you are|agent:uh-huh	you know doing Bible study or	0
agent:from this seventy hour work person to somebody that goes God i'm ready get out of here you know|agent:you know a lot of them_1 one of them_1 just had a child within the last year and he has totally changed|user:um-hum	it's incredible	1
user:on me|agent:[noise]|user:um and they and they did a full blood screen [noise]	but they didn't call that a drug test so tha[t]- i think they checked for drugs they just don't [noise] tell you they did	1
agent:right|user:that are specifically drug and alcohol related and it's like in the billions of dollars every year|agent:right	um and th[e]- the only way that they can prevent that is is you know making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free	1
agent:i guess that's kind of biased|agent:so|user:yeah	yeah	0
agent:yeah i guess so i guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the [laughter-consequences]|user:well yeah i guess it comes with the turf|agent:you know that that's kind of unfair also	yeah and then you're	1
user:o[pportunity]- opportunity|agent:yeah|user:well i guess that's one of the positive things that ha[s]- has come out of it some of the employee assistance program if you do test positive for something they will give you an opp[ortunity]-	to go	0
agent:yeah i know i ca[n't]- it's hard to believe but i guess it does [laughter]|user:well that happens|user:uh-huh	[laughter] [laughter-it] happens a lot	1
user:um|user:yeah well that they'll pull out one of your hairs and they can apparently test|agent:oh really	back a certain period of time	1
user:so i guess if they perfect that and then it's not|user:yeah|agent:it's amazing the things they can find out from different things on your body	quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or	0
agent:it's still not getting a real good picture|agent:and uh|agent:well i have a VCR and i've had to return it a couple of times because of the same part failure	oh my goodness	1
user:just c[ause]- you for instance clothing i you know i have two children and|user:um|user:things are are not made as well as they used to be i	um	1
user:oh i know it's really it's silly and|agent:stitching does come undone you know fairly soon and then the prices you pay for them are ridiculous|user:they never cut him off	and my i have teenagers and they	0
user:and also with cars i|user:and you know i try i try to look at the labels and i tr[y]- i try to [vocalized-noise] to buy things that are made in the USA because i think that's important and yet i find a lot of the the the homemade goods are are inferior|user:but uh the majority of things um don't last and they're just very inferior	um i- i bought a new car last summer and i shopped around for a long time i mean we went to a lot of different dealers and i wanted to buy an American car because i had had a Toyota and i really liked it but i felt like	0
user:uh-huh|user:exactly|agent:uh the reliability things falling off the inside uh you know frequent tune-ups every foreign car i've ever made i mean that i've ever bought i've i've loved it	yeah and they're so much more solid they sound better when you're in them they feel you feel like you're in a car and not rattling around in something	0
user:yeah|agent:i'd rather put the brakes on it and uh and have the the reliability in the car itself but uh|user:oh i know i've heard great things	oh yes and it's a safe car too it's a good made car	1
user:that|agent:well if you can see the transition what i'm beginning to see is that the Japanese cars and and even just foreign cars in as a whole|user:uh manufacturers still haven't got the the idea that that quality is important and	uh-huh	1
user:that's right|agent:foreign cars if that's the most reliable product especially when i'm paying for it|agent:uh i will continue to buy	that's right because you	1
user:yeah|agent:i don't know what's going to happen when it gets another twenty or thirty thousand miles on it|agent:and so far so good	well i'm looking for a used truck for my son and it's it's really been hard because we i we just don't have that much money to s[pend]-	0
agent:our other one's paid off uh i don't want to get another car until they just both fall [laughter-apart]|user:oh|user:you know	yeah yeah they're car payments are outrageous now	1
agent:you're in Texas|user:i'm in Texas|agent:Ohio and where are you now	um-hum yeah	1
user:okay so|agent:twenty five so|user:have you had any in the la[st]- ho[w]- well how old are you	you ha[ve]-	0
agent:pretty much|agent:yeah|user:small children too that come	so all ages	1
agent:uh-huh|user:but six months ahead has seemed to be okay|user:if they don't you know they'll say oh we're planning to go so and so that go to to a certain place that weekend with somebody else and we're already locked in	for them	0
user:and that's been very nice with uh i have one|user:immediate family|user:uh in the last few years it really has just been our	sister	0
user:or you go to Indiana on that|agent:um no the ones in Indiana uh-huh|user:those are the ones that are in Texas	uh-huh where in Indiana	1

agent:well you too and maybe i'll talk to you again okay|user:but it has been fun talking to you|agent:[vocalized-noise]	thank you	1
user:and i mean it's just it's there's so much opportunity in a larger company|user:found another opening in another department and moved on and so forth and so forth and is now uh personnel uh director|user:and she was telling me how she started as a clerk typist and then	to uh stay within the same company so you're not losing your seniority level	0
agent:uh relations a a big company sometime you can get lost you can you can uh|agent:uh perhaps better one on one|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:was aimed at in the first place if that makes sense|user:right|agent:and often times it's not really what	uh-huh	0
agent:because i do have an opportunity to help other people do better okay and i really like that|agent:but in my particular job i really enjoy it|user:i i [vocalized-noise]	uh-huh uh-huh	1
agent:for automation specialist training|agent:sixteen and twenty week classes at at uh three hours a day twice a week|user:uh-huh	that is wonderful	1
user:with uh everything becoming so much more technical and sophisticated|user:that is great and that is so smart because|user:uh-huh	you're just not finding people out in the work force that have the skills that you necessarily need	1
agent:desk top publishers so you know|user:oh my|agent:full blown	oh exactly i mean it's incredible	0
agent:but i i was in the same situation i had to learn|user:uh-huh uh-huh|user:[laughter]	right	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah i i i feel that way and it's a long time to get you know you work for many years with two weeks vacation per year|user:unfortunately but that just it drains you you know after a while it jus[t]-	yeah exactly right	1
agent:well no it well in some instances yes|user:is that uh what your company policy is too|user:it's hard	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:ninety days or thirty days or ninety days or whatever it is they have two weeks off or a week off or someth[ing]-|user:uh-huh	right	1
agent:yeah yeah they work for us and and they they go to school back in the Fall|user:like a co-op for the summer almos[t]-|agent:pardon me	uh-huh	1
agent:and i think you know i say if you if you don't do it you r[eally]- really don't have to worry about it|user:yeah|agent:that's [laughter] in a nutshell	yeah	0
agent:and i'd make them_1 do that|agent:i think they have it must be a law or something because_1 awful lot of companies have them_1|agent:and i think most companies have those [noise] now	uh-huh	1
agent:but if they flat refused you know and said no i won't then i'd say well then i'm sorry then you can't say we're not going to have druggies in our payroll|agent:right|agent:right	yeah	1
agent:i think if if you suspect it and i'm sure a doctor can look at somebody and suspect don't you think by looking at them_1|agent:for fear that they would you know i i'd get that but|user:yeah	in advanced cases yes	1
user:but|agent:oh i would too absolutely absolutely i just don't uh|user:i would definitely want to know if these people have AIDS i mean i'm the	and	1
agent:so i started out at TI years ago my daughter works at TI|user:uh|agent:[noise] and uh love it just love it i wish i'd found this company twenty years ago but	is that how you got on the	0

agent:[laughter]|user:he he's been doing this evidently for a a good number of years|agent:uh-huh	and but it's unusual	1

agent:yeah yeah i would too|agent:yeah|user:but it would really have to be a last resort because that would just i- i would feel so guilty	just i don't know unless i knew that they were somewhere just really	1
user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh|agent:right i'll tell you the people i feel the the sorriest for there's a [vocalized-noise] a a guy at this particular one i go to that i think that he's really an intelligent person but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate	um	1
agent:and the people love them and|user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh	i'm sure	1
agent:yeah yeah there are and and uh it really helps those people i think|user:but that's great i didn't know there were such groups|agent:yeah it's quite an experience	uh-huh	1

agent:uh-huh|user:it's up here in Plano anyway|user:or is it on Custer	and uh it's very good i uh	0
agent:okay|agent:okay|user:uh-huh something like that yeah	i've also tried uh	0
agent:on the west side of seventy five|agent:it's uh right there in Richardson|agent:oh	uh-huh	1
user:you know the ones who have dogs are very uh protective of them|agent:yeah|agent:so	and i think that's one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets	0
agent:a lot more care than cats do cats are pretty independent you know you feed them_1 and they keep themselves clean and|agent:and dogs take a lot of|user:yeah that's true	yeah that's true	1
agent:yeah|user:going on with this pet population and having to just get rid of them that that kind of gripes on me some but|user:just	[noise] but i don't know	0
user:all right you know like you said i haven't uh been keeping track of what all has been going on in uh Central America myself|user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	um and uh	1
user:and so that that that kind of thing concerns me um it's the things that we're not doing that we should be doing like right now there's a big outbreak of uh|agent:yeah|user:and we end up throwing in money and a lot of people getting killed and when push comes to shove we seem to back out on the gorillas like we did the Kurds back uh in the late seventies	of course it's a little further south in South America but there's an outbreak of uh	0
agent:right|user:right now we're starting we're starting to talk about having free trade with Mexico|agent:[noise]	and	0
agent:uh so warm that it tends to make work harder to do|agent:i've often wondered if that does have something to do with the the climate being|agent:to be as productive as some reason another and as the higher latitude countries	um-hum	1
agent:yeah unless they have a coffee strike or the drug problem gets out of uh proportion like it did for awhile|agent:um-hum|user:you know i mean we know what's going on in Poland we know what's going on in Romania we know the Germanies are getting back together we didn't you know we know all what's going in Europe but we never here anything about what's going on down in S[outh]- you know in South and Central America	or unless we're sending thousands of troops down there to kick somebody's butt i mean	1
user:um so it's it's like really strange that we never pay that much attention|agent:um-hum um-hum|agent:yeah	i- i	1
user:[laughter-okay]|agent:okay well i can go ahead and start and tell you mine um we're from San Antonio and that's where i grew up so i was used to the heat and out here right now um gosh it gets to about seventies high seventies and it gets very cold at night|user:all right	oh uh-huh	1
user:[noise] excuse me especially thunderstorms|user:uh spring usually consists of a lot of rain|agent:uh-huh	i don't know we've got we had one of those blow through tonight	1
user:in fact the the sea[son]- well the season's just about over|agent:oh i bet|user:yeah quite a bit	for that uh in fact we drove down to Corpus last week	1
agent:the tornadoes and stuff were you|agent:y'all weren't getting any of the strings of uh|user:we had a pretty rainy fall last year as well	um we had a few down here but but	0
agent:yeah San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come it's compl[ete]- it's a complete mess everything floods all the under passes so i didn't realize that Dallas had that same problem|agent:um-hum|user:filled up and everything else just runs off so	yeah	1
agent:it's just it's just such a change uh from Texas because i had grown up with uh the heat and and was used to|agent:but um it's a really nice area uh|user:yeah	uh-hum	1
agent:or is it pretty dry|user:w[e]- we|agent:does Dallas get high humidity	it's pretty dry we get	0
agent:and uh so it's been good|user:that's nice|agent:but um but we like it so it's a nice change so we'll be here a couple of years and we thought well we'll take advantage of it and and see what all the Pacific coast is like	yeah my wife's originally from Virginia and we lived there for about nine months and that was a real change for me	1
agent:well you think that takes care of the the time and|agent:okay|agent:[laughter] yeah because_1 we could sure use it	i think that'll do it [laughter]	1
agent:an early uh he he was for sanctions|agent:uh Colin Powell was uh was against uh|agent:big story in the paper about it today Bush trying to comment on it that	um-hum	1
agent:be interesting to keep watching i guess but i'm just afraid it's going it's going to break us|agent:i don't know be|agent:um	um-hum	1
user:and um what about the whole situation with with the refugees|user:right|agent:since i teach history so	the Kurds	1
agent:such a volatile uh area i mean there's just no stability there period that's what's|agent:uh but i[t's]- it's just such a|user:um-hum um-hum	right	0
user:so that you know many of the countries Turkey and Syria are still the same as they were before for traveling|agent:okay|agent:[laughter-right] okay	um	1
user:[noise]	all right i guess our i- we're in the process of a home repair right at this point because we're we're painting the outside of our house	0
user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:yes we have brick on the outside and uh it the colors that were there changed the and the colors we painted changed the entire look of the house completely|agent:oh	that's neat isn't it	0
user:uh|user:do|user:to do it ourselves in a kind of a slow process but we learned how to	retile bathtubs and	0
user:for young people to learn how to|user:uh i think it's neat for|user:uh coming up and uh	uh take care of their	0
user:nice to have it come out to uh|user:that's nice isn't it|user:yeah	uh positive and look	0
agent:yeah|agent:that's interesting|user:kind of depends on the on the quality of carpet i suppose but	uh i[n]- in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything	0
agent:well it's an older home it was made back in the early sixties it's a pier beam house|user:okay tell me about your home|user:[noise]	uh-huh	0
user:but uh it's pretty typical for the area as well|user:and um i live in the basic three bedroom two bath home so at least i have two bathrooms that's not so bad|user:that sounds really interesting i live in a suburb of Dallas	um i've always been interested in older homes personally	0
user:most houses i would think would be sort of like uh what we live in just a|user:but uh it seems like though for your area that's that's sort of different in a big city like that [noise]|user:um i do have garden but it's it's extremely small	you know a basic tract house	1
user:yeah that's really it that's a plus|user:yeah|user:yeah	at least we do have uh like three walk-in closets here so that's that's maybe not so so typical but uh	1
user:that's nice that is nice|user:yeah|agent:pretty close to it in the entire neighborhood	but you know too the only bad thing about that is then you have to keep up you know you have	0
agent:yeah this entire neighborhood everybody keeps the places up real nice|user:are you working on it i mean do do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation|user:well can you tell me anything else about the [laughter-house]	yeah that's that's nice	0
user:but uh|user:you know there's not there's not a whole lot you can do with it|user:so uh it it's it was quite a change for me to come to a house like this now that's just you know a very square little box and	anyway	1
agent:if i want to if i want to sit around and mess mess with my garden i'll mess with my garden if i want to work in the flower beds fine|user:[laughter-yeah]|agent:basically just kind of left alone	yeah	1
user:i never have much luck with tomatoes i do i do plant a lot of beans because it seems like the the uh bugs get on them so easily|agent:tomatoes i'm not real sure what they're going to do this year|user:yeah	and i have a real problem with anything pes[ticide]- like pesticides or anything like that so	0
user:i guess it works but um you have to really wash your vegetables after that|user:you know i've heard him talk about that forever|user:that's true that's true i've my dad is a farmer so	so it won't make you sick	1
user:and that was|user:yeah yeah that's that's rough the house that i used to live in had like one bath and a half|agent:not even a half bath	even just with two people that was a pain	1
user:yeah|agent:uh he he likes to dig around a little bit then his mother comes in and says h[ow]- why did you let him play in the dirt like i said he was enjoying himself|user:i guess he's a big help out in your garden right	[laughter]	1
agent:uh-huh|user:um currently i'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program|user:great	i'm mainly do a lot of walking um i have a son that's a little bit overweight and	1
agent:uh-huh|user:uh i have a total of five children i have three left living at home|agent:[laughter]	and they do take up a big part of my	0
agent:uh-huh|user:uh what i found from my experiences you have to budget time for yourself|agent:yeah	and then uh the you you can use what ever rationale you want but basically the healthier you stay the longer you'll live	0
agent:um-hum|user:the research i've done and uh i've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty three and|user:yeah um	it's it's amazing that uh you know like prior to like nineteen	0
agent:that's really interesting|user:and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks and|agent:um-hum	yeah he did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours	0
agent:i'll have to remember that that'd be really interesting my husband wants to go into med school and be a|user:uh Coronaries Cholesterol and Chlorine|agent:and what's the name of this book again	yeah	1
agent:if you get a chance read Dr Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol|user:it's just hard to believe|user:something like arteriosclerosis is	um-hum	1
agent:yeah|user:[laughter] they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued|user:everything's like within uh five to ten percent and all [laughter-that] [laughter-kind] [laughter-of] [laughter-thing] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter]	[laughter]	1
agent:um apparently it's getting worse i mean i can tell that just by driving in Dallas you have the low f[lying]- flying gray cloud on certain days but|user:uh-huh|agent:understand it and figure out where i am in the whole mess	right	1
user:and|user:and they just don't want to sink the money into it unless someone clamps down on them_1 makes them_1 do it|user:you know some environmental standards like a filters on smokestacks et cetera are quite expensive	dumping chemicals et cetera and all that	0
user:you know they besides sinking their own time into it is|user:stops a lot of people from getting involved in the environmental issues|user:which probably	that when we	0
user:i'm going to work on doing that a little bit more to people that|user:so you know i'll|agent:[laughter]	you know they just	0
user:it just seems though|agent:gosh|user:they're	um i guess we could talk about smoking because_1 it is a form of air pollution	0
user:than what the smoker gets through the filter you know what affect that had on me|agent:just as yeah|user:and i just wonder you know all the time when i was a little kid breathing the smo[ke]- secondhand smoke which people say is just as bad or even w[orse]- worse	for a coronary artery disease when i was younger	0
user:uh-huh|agent:it i don't allow people to smoke in my house and i i hope they respect that and you know i i send [laughter-them] [laughter-outside]|agent:you know it	yeah	1
user:i had an uncle that had quadruple bypass surgery and was near death many times|user:um|user:but	and he's kn[ow]- you know they've told him for years to quit smoking and he still smokes you know	0
agent:really|user:but the last few years we've barely gotten any snow at all|user:could expect some snowfall [vocalized-noise] twenty four even up to we had thirty eight inches of snow one time	yeah it's you know maybe there'll be six inches on the ground at one time	0
agent:uh Richardson has uh started recently a newspaper recycling program|user:um-hum|agent:i- i think that uh recycling is uh is real important right now or or you know for our future of the ecology and everything	um-hum	1
user:um|agent:right|user:well they're uh out i'm out in uh California recycling has been in for a while i mean it's yes it's very important now i think it's actually always been important we're just recognizing it now that things are starting to run out	it's	0
user:but uh that sure made it easy i mean there was like no excuse not to recycle you just need two trash cans and if it's recyclable you throw it in one and if it's not you throw it in the other and take both out|agent:right|user:which increased their labor costs tremendously	um so that seemed to have been working quite well	0
user:um without any charge for you know long-term effects on the land or|user:things like aluminum only cost what it costs the company to produce them|user:uh through selective taxation or whatever currently most	you know [vocalized-noise] with with min[imal]- minimal taxation for reple[nishing]- re[plenishing]- replenishing the land after the mine is gone or	0
agent:to really concentrate a lot more on on limiting tho[se]- the use of those|user:um-hum|agent:styrofoams and things like that uh i really think we need to	yeah	1
user:uh they call it precycling in other words keep {recycling} but|agent:right|user:you know not buy those styrofoam cups not buy individual aluminum cans if you're going to buy soda but get some you know larger reusable cheaper container and things like that	minimize the original consumption too	1
agent:we're uh my wife and i are are looking at you know designing a new house now and uh probably you know some years away before we'll be ready to build it but|agent:yeah|user:and more efficient pickups and everything	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:yes|user:[noise]|agent:oh my goodness	do you have any strong opinions on that	1
user:that|agent:right and then the guys who want to spend it that way sure they'll pay more for insurance|user:absolutely	uh-huh i think that would've been a much smarter way to handle it and the another thing that would've helped a lot would be to make certain that [noise] the people who were going to use the money that we were providing	0
agent:right|user:yes they don't they don't lose anything|agent:uh because if they win they win big and if they don't who cares [laughter] they don't loose	well uh i don't know what could've been done other than the uh insurance regulation but i certainly think that was a mistake and the um	0
user:on a CD|agent:that's right and i mean it would've put these money brokers out of business|user:been alert and i would not have just been chasing the highest percentage return	yeah	0
agent:and that's fair enough|user:yeah|user:that's right	um-hum [noise] well uh do you think that we're heading for another uh debacle of this sort in the uh insurance industry	1
agent:hm|user:had switched over from their own private plans to the first executive annuities that are not getting their benefit checks this time|agent:it's a problem	and the the state governor is saying that we're going to protect those people but how are we going to do that	1
user:uh-huh|agent:i think constitutional congress would be probably a good idea|agent:yep	yep i i would vote for that	1
user:w[ell]-|agent:well now you s[ay]- you say two different parts of the country what are are y[ou]- are you referring to yourself are you|user:i guess nothing is a[s]- as awful as abortion but like gun control and uh day care and things like that and there are some very different views uh of the people connected with the program which i thought was really interesting you know	yeah well being i[n]- in in Baltimore see Maryland is um	0
agent:but they uh [noise] quickly did away with it|user:um-hum|agent:i mean they p[ermitted]- they i believe if i'm correct i believe they permitted to carrying concealed weapons	hm	1
agent:about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag|user:sure|user:yeah	well i'll tell you	1
user:is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then|user:i think uh you know but i i still what the stan[ds]- flag stands for i guess to me|user:your ideas you know the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that uh though i would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself i i	they should be allowed	1
user:uh i think that's what's made democracy|agent:uh yeah but here again i go back to the second amendment you can disagree by s[peech]- freedom of speech|user:oh i think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government	yeah	1
agent:no|user:as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point i think yeah yeah because realistically like for you for you you don't think it's right|user:and whatever i- i think that that's viable [noise] um	and i would never do it i i love this country too much and that symbol means a lot to me	0
agent:and i used to know as a Boy Scout but all i remember was the red in the flag represented blood tha[t]- that was shed to to create this country|user:um-hum|agent:the what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country	yeah	1
user:um even you know for instance the pro-life pro-choice movement uh you know i don't know anybody that actually supports abortion|user:and you sit and you try and think about it logically and and and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing uh but logically|user:yeah it g[ets]- when it's uh it's an emotional issue	but they would vote pro-choice	0
user:no no i think the um|agent:well tell me has it ever been decided when when is a uh fetus a human|user:aren't you know	sometimes i guess	0
agent:um-hum|user:yeah and how yeah how it'll sway from one e[xtreme]- one extreme to another|user:within a	uh i think that uh	1
agent:i prefer you know the cotton with very little in fact when i look for|agent:uh periodically i don't know we might i haven't we didn't talk about materials i|agent:uh whether that they just like to switch materials	oh definitely	1
agent:know when you have to go out or go to lunch or whatever it's to to walk or however and get to a place that is uh you don't have to go in and out of the of the temperature|agent:and they they say that's so much more healthy for you to you|user:oh def[initely]- yeah i mean	i haven't heard that	1
agent:public schools oh i didn't hear that yet|user:well i just read something in fact i think it was today about how the public a lot of private or a lot of the public schools now are going to uniforms|agent:totally ridiculous of course but [vocalized-noise]	yeah	1
agent:uh and the on[ly]- again the one thing i am at at work is is certainly a professional look but i'm not saying that that will not cha[nge]- the professional look will look differently from year to year perhaps|agent:or clothes really i guess uh|user:yeah	do you spend a lot of money on clothes for work	1
user:[noise]|user:tell me how yours work|agent:[laughter] [laughter-okay] [laughter]	well at the my i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago	0
agent:oh no|user:so we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do uh he wants to do that's satisfactory and we've been here seven months and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently|user:and uh	[laughter] so you see	1
user:and we really uh|agent:yeah|user:and where we didn't want to come down	lessened it uh our living expenses uh more than	0
agent:and then moved from California where we realized we could never buy a [laughter-house] [laughter-anyway] [laughter-no] [laughter-matter] [laughter-how] [laughter-much] [laughter-we] [laughter-saved]|user:wonder[ful]-|agent:my salary so we could buy a house so we virtually did that for about two years which worked real well	yes	1
agent:on your [laughter-friends] that's true [laughter] that's true [laughter] well we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with we both have older cars and something will come up and we'll end up having to spend a thousand dollars you know on the car in two months or something and|user:and i really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down [laughter-somewhat] [laughter-on] [laughter-your] [laughter-friends]|agent:um-hum	yes	1
user:she was oh she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty|agent:gosh|user:letters of applications to universities	so it can be done	0
agent:how about you do you have um a mach[ine]-|user:uh-huh|agent:i can just call school and transfer everything over to school over the phone lines so	an an P S E	1
user:yeah [laughter] i'd i've noticed uh there was some scattered at work and i notice the uh|agent:possible exception of the fact that it's got a mouse port built in the back|agent:what the major advantage of a P S two over anything else is with the	through put is much faster on mine than than those but i think it's just because of the	0

user:that would be to keep it at a level those levels i guess that that were originally appropriated w[as]- was when|user:yeah but it it it it would that be uh well let's see two thousand out of eleven thousand that's about a little over twenty per cent uh i- i should imagine that|agent:so they're going to have to do another contract to restock that to get ready in case something else is needed	the Soviet threat i guess was perceived as being	0
user:uh in the area of defense or perhaps we have paid too much there i don't know it just seems to me that over the years|user:yeah well i- i- i'm what i'm uh i guess uh it concerned about talking about the taxes in general and that that was an area that i- i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for|agent:areas in which TI stands to to gain some some short term business to restock that	now the and and it's it's a cliche i- i but i see it myself i see where	0

user:the states now establish uh don't have enough money so they|agent:uh-huh|user:program now is a uh program now is uh fees that that fund these things i guess that's trickled down to the states and	they must charge fees uh i- i i'm not too sure of that	0
agent:more say|agent:well i guarantee you you'd be paying a lot more in taxes i[f]- if uh the Democrats had|user:uh uh a tax a sales tax which is getting to uh quite high levels i'm not sure that i'm not up fairly close to that	you really think so	0

agent:his attitude is i think a little bit|user:right|agent:sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something has paid off not only for us his	um-hum	1
user:hum|agent:so we faced that too but he learns quite a bit he learned quite a bit from not only from nursery school but he learned quite a bit from the older boys and|user:um-hum um-hum	um-hum	1

agent:yeah|user:where one of the congressmen i think it was from Connecticut and i probably will will screw that up but|user:yeah i saw one about a month or so ago on Twenty Twenty i think it was	he wanted to start	0
user:right yeah exactly|user:right|agent:no i mean and because it's you know [vocalized-noise] and it's because nothing is black and white you know you just can't go up and go up there and say well we're going to we're going to stop crime now if it were that simple somebody would have [laughter-done] [laughter-it] a long time ago and that's what ki[nd]- you know they there's the people that says well we'll we'll never raise taxes or we will raise taxes or you know it's like the guy who says you're never going to raise taxes	right exactly	1

agent:[laughter]|agent:oh i|user:though i can't see why it was great	uh	0
agent:in trade for|user:in trade for|agent:that was some [vocalized-noise] some some program where people gave their time	money	1
agent:i real[ly]- i really don't see anything wrong with it i just don't think that it should be mandatory that every person have to do that|agent:um-hum|user:the[re]- there's a lot of work to be done	i	1
user:then|user:then they at least one not more than say three or four|user:but trade a year	it would definitely effect unemployment	1
user:there would darn sure be more hours labor available in the nation for everyone else|user:off the streets for a year|user:but if we took these people off	and who knows maybe	0
user:yeah|agent:job market|agent:without without working in the the traditional American	be it selling drugs or whatever	1

agent:good paying labor|agent:if more Americans were working and meaningful|user:hum	yes	1
user:hum|agent:is start going to space|agent:uh what i was thinking more along the lines of	and that way just create more jobs	0

agent:their families better through whatever means|agent:to supply|agent:deny people the right	right	1
agent:that's right when we're in a world of hurt|user:i mean we don't need to buy other people's stuff right now|agent:oh absolutely absolutely	[vocalized-noise]	1

user:the basic question is too much|agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	and	1
user:i i don't know i find myself in a position sort of like selective|user:but uh|user:and i don't know uh who came up with that figure but i think it really comes out to be more than the third	approval almost like the United Way campaign where you agree with most of the agencies but uh don't agree with some of them	1
agent:it just seems as if|user:uh social program but you don't hear what the cost is same in Eur[ope]- in Britain and other nations much higher tax rates|user:we hear about Sweden with their	but the	1
user:one of the other problems that i have recently is|user:the|user:uh i think they need to bite the same bullet that most individuals do	centered on such	0
user:but other things uh|user:so that's what i meant about the selectives some things i think we're doing extremely wrong could save a lot of money|user:rather than accepting it as the norm for a nice golfing trip	like i enjoy seeing money spent on the Smithsonian Institute in Washington i think it's one of the nicest national treasures and i love to see	1
agent:these countries to run their own governments|agent:but paying for their|user:uh-huh	oh i think it's way	1
agent:that's something i would and that subject in itself i'd love to see that entire thing revised|user:i have some problem with social programs at home in terms of making it too convenient to be on on welfare|user:i agree i think that's	oh yeah	0
user:one person in our system of uh|user:by a stroke of a pen i think our president can forgive foreign debt and that's a lot of power vested in one|user:things which can occur in the foreign aid uh	governance	1
user:yeah well your your neighbor to the north Oklahoma just voted for state legislators uh one term|agent:they're not going to do anything to t[ap]- tap out the well|agent:playing power broker	no let's see	0
user:creating the incumbent uh|user:yeah i think it takes away the issue of of a lot of the uh special lobbyist groups and everything else|agent:two terms then they got to sit out one	about	1
user:that's an issue i think that really fits into it because there are a lot of people that sit|user:uh it doesn't solve the non elected bureauc[rats]- bureaucrats either that's|agent:that's not going to slow them down at all	in the same position and really don't give a hoot who gets elected	0
user:yeah|agent:ready to put their hand on the first wrench and tighten the first bolt|agent:well the question is wh[o]- who's	How do you feel about the information we get	0

agent:yeah|user:day after day after day and then|agent:uh-huh	then you really get socked to it if you don't watch it	1
agent:[laughter] i know isn't that funny [laughter]|user:for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid|agent:um-hum	yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:then some of the others do|agent:oh yeah	but that's the one that your cost center manager sees every month	0
agent:yeah|user:you're not the only one|agent:um-hum	so	0
agent:so i said shoot i need one of [laughter-those]|user:oh that's not bad|agent:a girlfriend of mine found uh uh it was a Visa or MasterCard she found the ad for one in like a Good Hou[sekeeping]- Housekeeping magazine for eleven percent	yeah	0
agent:huh|agent:uh-huh|user:got my Visa card so as long as they have no annual membership fee i it would be okay but i can't see paying someone	to use their card	0
agent:so do you do any of your own repairs or maintenance work|user:[noise]	well i do a little bit i just do mainly you know change the oil and uh i'll do an occasional tune-up things like that	0
agent:has happened that you didn't know about and Advanced Auto closed fifteen minutes ago and|agent:well it's it's a lot easier than getting under there and finding out something major|user:i feel like if if i can afford to have it done i'm going to have it done	yeah	1
agent:wow|user:it was twelve hundred bucks|user:and by the time i got everything done	[laughter]	0
agent:yeah|user:so i just rather than get tied up in in a bunch of you know garbage i just went ahead and and got it done and and to heck with it|agent:did they	but uh	0
agent:okay|user:i think it still has fuel injection there's i think the DX is the one that does not|agent:no i've i've got the LX	but uh they are probably one of the nicest running cars i've ever driven	0
agent:Continental and they've had nothing but nightmares with that car|agent:but my parents have a um|agent:Grand Marquis as far as just looks	oh really	1

agent:really|user:you can't even come close to a Ford|user:American truck	and uh that's why i buy Ford trucks	0
agent:you know you're not sure what you're going to get when you change|user:yeah|agent:yeah and you know like i said i've had i've had great luck with the Hondas and it's kind of hard to walk away from a good thing when it's	they're they're good cars i- i- i will say that you probably made a good choice	0

agent:that's where i see that paper's got to be better|agent:i mean that's that's where the main|user:that's right you're right	uh-huh	1
agent:and uh|user:[laughter]|agent:you could easily say well we should go back to living in caves [laughter] but no one's going to do that so i think you need to make compromises slowly enough people adjust to it	right right	1
agent:right|user:when i was young we d[id]- we did a lot of fishing and on Lake Erie and i [noise] i mean when i went back|user:when um	i just couldn't believe the difference it's just terrible the way it's polluted because of	0

user:for me to be you know i feel very safe where i am|agent:yeah|user:and that to me is worth the extra money	you know instead of	1
agent:and i don't know i- i attributed i think a lot of that to women working|user:um-hum|agent:or to uh you know do something for someone else	yeah	0
user:right|user:um-hum|agent:in in other words like anyone can live on a a certain income no matter what it is you have to	right	1

user:yeah they have been off and on|agent:so they were contenders till about three or fours years ago|agent:yeah	uh maybe	1
agent:you didn't like that move|user:because he was upset at him|user:i guess i was feeling pretty confident about the team Valentine this year until uh he got mad at Pete Incaviglia and just cut him for	well i i can understand his point i thought it was kind of childish to just cut him instead of trying to trade him because then Detroit picks him up and	0
agent:last year i was buying a lot of Juan Gonzalez cards|agent:yeah i'm kind of into baseball cards so uh|agent:well good	hum	1
agent:carried over and has hurt his image and everything else|agent:and it's too bad it|agent:and	well but it didn't didn't seem to really hurt the team in fact seemed to kind of fire them up and make them work harder	1

agent:you don't always have to do that but um we have a dutch oven and and we found some really fun recipes that we can do in that that are quite|agent:outdoors and|user:yeah	yeah	1
user:and one of the things was that uh|agent:and it's jus[t]-|user:we went uh one time one time with a uh another group or with the the scouting group but it was the parents uh you know it was a family camp out	the uh we had uh uh a couple that were uh	0

user:they're very much like uh|user:and you know like you think of lizards doing but they don't do that|agent:[vocalized-noise] [laughter]	well the thing about them_1 is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes	1
agent:was the drumming|user:and he didn't he the only thing he didn't like very well was the drumming when Dan would drum he'd|agent:uh-huh	sit there and	0
user:for a while they built a a run for him out to the side of the house you know he'd been on the patio but they put the run out there and he didn't like this run because there were no people that came by|user:uh|user:brought this Norwegian elkhound and home and he was so funny	and sometimes he would just make a racket until you came and got him and one night we'd forgotten to put water out for him and and Hal and i were in bed and all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the house and	0
agent:oh|user:and it got dark and he didn't get him in again and they searched and searched and searched for him but uh|user:and Dan didn't know it	uh it got too cold up there and he he died in a tree tha[t]- they found him the next day in a tree he was dead	0
agent:oh my goodness|user:it dried up a little bit like ashes and you could just vacuum it up|user:but even when he went when he had an accident or something uh if you just let it dry it dries kind of like uh especially when he was inside and eating just lettuce	the winter time there was no smell at all no odor at all to it in the summertime when he was outside	0
agent:oh my goodness these guys th[ey]- well actually they're my husband's pets|user:what do your cats do besides sitting and purring and letting you pet them_1 [laughter]|user:well	[laughter]	0
user:yeah|agent:[laughter] the [laughter] he is something he's like a dog he really he just flops for you he just wants his belly scratched and that's it you know|user:[laughter] Newhart [laughter]	[laughter]	1
agent:right|agent:right|user:yeah sometimes you know the the time consuming stuff can be the worst things to go for especially when you have a group of people	i usually stick m[ainly]- mainly with something i can put on the grill usually i'll get a	1
agent:uh-huh|user:a good red wine|user:and i use a little bit of uh of	and put a little sugar in there and a little Worcestershire sauce	0
user:then i marinate mushrooms the same way i use the same|agent:yeah|user:yeah or just you can just you you can use your imagination on that kind of stuff	same mixture	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and uh and usually i'll just i'll serve something like a salad and some potatoes i- i take new potatoes and i'll i'll steam those|user:it's just something i've enjoyed doing over the over the years	i'll leave the the peel on them_1 and steam those and then i'll i'll pour some uh frozen peas	1
agent:yeah one that you when you're in a hurry for a decent meal|user:my best simple one|agent:well what's your best meal to cook though your best simple one	uh let's see probably	1
agent:you like the electric one then|user:and it does it does as good as anything|user:so we just use we have an electric wok	yeah	0
agent:i've never tried egg rolls|user:uh|agent:hum	uh they're not really that tough after you after you do it about two or three times the first few times learn how to wrap them_1 and everything else that that's really the key it's what goes in it is very simple	1
agent:uh-huh|user:and you just put the stuff in there in the middle you just take a spoonful of it and put it in the middle kind of form it you know like a tube|agent:hum	and then kind of roll it up and	0
agent:right|user:and that that should just you have to kind of taste one to see you know see if it's done or not|user:but it's uh then you just deep fry them_1 until they're done	but uh	1
agent:they're peeled|agent:yeah|user:yeah well they're actually they they're canned tomatoes but they're they call and they dice and they're small	and uh then they have other stuff in there with them_1 green peppers and stuff i just toss one of those in there	1

agent:uh-huh|user:uh and hickory chips and stuff like that in there|user:i do throw a couple cubes of charcoal you know this uh	which does give it the appearance but i just i like the i like to be able to push the starter and have it light up	1
user:uh types of wardrobe that one might need to have|user:the clothing i guess that uh i wanted to talk about is the different uh|user:uh	in the kind of job or well i think that you probably have a full-time job if you're a college student	0
agent:i would just say the only difference is you know like long sleeve and short sleeve between summer and winter|agent:so um|user:sure	yes	0
agent:uh-huh|user:than i could wear|user:oh that wouldn't do and this wouldn't do i just seemed to have more clothes	or that i wanted to wear	0
agent:um-hum|user:i have dark hair and kind of sallow {reddy} complexion and um|user:um	those bei[ge]- good looking cashmere beige suits	0
agent:uh-huh|user:in the colors that i out that i already to the colors that i already had that i could wear plus i bought some|user:uh	and do you know it made traveling and working so much more simple	0
agent:uh-huh|user:when i would wear those beige|user:but i didn't look people would say have you been feeling well lately	suits	1
agent:i wear a lot of like a magenta or a hot pink color you know and and in those shades|agent:um|user:uh-huh	yes exactly	0
user:keep that in mind because those those pieces of clothing|user:well when you start interviewing for jobs and if you do put in some quite a bit of money in your clothing|user:um	will do you probably for several years	1
agent:and i have a number of different blouses i could wear with it one blouse that looks really nice with it is a real deep red blouse|agent:i have um this suede suit it's a double breasted coat with a skirt|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	0
user:uh|agent:um-hum|user:the color to wear with outfits	uh in fact she doesn't give white a real high grade	1
user:uh they need to look good with uh|user:they really pretty much needed to be|user:uh	the skirt and the shoes and you count you think of it as a total outfit	1
user:bye-bye|agent:you too bye-bye|user:you have you have a nice day	[noise]	1
agent:uh they've got enough problems keeping their own people happy to worry about you know nuking other people who aren't bothering them|user:right|agent:given that anything like that happens	right well i guess that that that brings up a question is it their i think in in the long term we could see a a situation where there are in [vocalized-noise] incredible civil wars and that the the structure of the country breaks down and there's strife and much much death	0
agent:uh [laughter] so um you know they might be perfectly happy to sit back and wait for it to happen [noise]|user:[laughter-right] [laughter]|agent:and that's certainly communism as far as i can tell	that's right	1
agent:Iraq|agent:with uh the Soviet Union having um supported uh|user:that's	right	1
agent:yeah|user:but without something like death or impeachment [laughter]|user:is it	i- i- i can't recall	1
user:and i'd say seems to me uh that the missiles are the threat|agent:right right|user:to convince me	[noise]	0
user:yes i see that's a good great point|agent:uh but certainly you know like Lithuania and stuff i think would lose theirs|user:right	okay well so	1
user:have mixed emotions on one hand|user:well i guess i|agent:well how do you feel about that	i think golly the pay isn't good enough if you didn't really want to do it	1

user:uh yeah yeah until i just finally had to say|agent:they call you all the time|user:i know during the days when i was uh just not a working mom at all it was ridiculous	i am so sorry that you know	0

agent:um-hum|agent:yeah|user:yeah and would they really eat it of course that's not really the you know the quality of education	but	1
user:there is a quality of excellence expected here it's very difficult|agent:how do you feel about the Plano school system you feel like it's pretty good compared to the others surround you know Richardson and Allen and|user:i think overall	for the children in this school district to	1
agent:uh-huh|user:this honor and that honor and participated in this competition and participated in that competition|user:when we were writing things down i said you know you can't really talk about all your individual things but you know you've got to make sure that when you put down band here that it's not just any old band that this is a band that took	so they understand really	1
agent:so what's the last thing you ever had done to it|user:uh|agent:um-hum um-hum	well the last thing we did to it was today they had uh replaced the gear shift	0

agent:because i only change the oil every twenty five thousand miles|user:uh-huh uh-huh|user:oh gosh	[laughter-right] [laughter-right]	1
agent:so it still shifts just a crisp today as it did when it was brand new|user:um-hum um-hum|user:right right	that's am[azing]- that is amazing	1
agent:well i bought it from a fellow that i knew uh that worked up here it had sixty nine thousand miles on it at that time he always took good care of it and he bought it just to pull a boat with and when it|user:so the car was how old when you when you bought it|agent:and doing that it and the uh radiator on it has been rebuilt [laughter-twice]	um-hum	1
user:yeah|user:exactly|user:yeah	uh-huh uh-huh	1
user:um-hum|user:yeah|user:um-hum	right	1
agent:it's just a V eight same as what was in your Cougar probably|agent:um|agent:oh really	yeah	0
agent:and generally it ruins the engine to the point where you have to replace it|user:yeah|agent:and the only thing to do is take it apart and completely rebuild it from bottom out	yeah	1
agent:oh okay that's not a broad enough topic [laughter] i'm ready when you are|user:[noise] yeah the changing roles of women how roles changed and what do you see coming in the future|agent:-[w]omen	okay yeah [laughter] sounds good	0
agent:i this was my twentieth high school reunion in Chicago and basically|user:um-hum|user:um-hum uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:but but the|agent:right it was more it was more civil rights oriented or race oriented rather than gender based yeah|user:um uh before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like uh Black people or you know just large large groups of people	right	0
user:[laughter]|agent:um i'm trying to think of what else i have a lot of opinions on this except all of a sudden i went blank [laughter] a lot of the things um the demographics too i mean there's more i don't have the numbers in my head right now but a lot of the things that brought feminism i mean there are just more women in in in the demographics just generally in the United States in terms of being|user:yes uh-huh	um-hum	1

agent:i'm seriously considering going back to school for law|agent:finally to a point where i mean i don't know why i didn't didn't do it sooner but this is probably typical of the women's movement too the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway if you want to go back to school|agent:and what you'll find is i mean i'm just now	um	1
user:um-hum|agent:twenty eight thirty if you haven't slowed down something will slow you down do you know what i'm saying um because it's just you find out that you're really not|agent:and you'll find that probably by the time you're	yeah yeah	1

user:oh yeah oh|agent:one in your home that has the same stuff in it as your office does or have it kind of connect it|agent:have it	well you can have them connected by a by a modem if you want to	0
user:but uh|user:yeah so|agent:to a certain point i'd just get messed up and i would be totally lost	you know it's uh you know the computer's it's uh the you know [vocalized-noise] growing thing in uh you know [vocalized-noise] both home and business i i think eventually	1
user:um accounting classes in college|user:i was just commenting the other night that it's uh going to reach the point where|user:and uh	have to have computer for the students to use you know in every class uh right now i teach over at Brookhaven College	0
agent:i do our income taxes too and you're right it probably would be a lot easier if i use the|user:it's i use it a lot|user:i use the computer to do you know all of my accounting work and of course i write letters on the computer and i do income tax on the [laughter-computer] so	yeah you know it's just it would be	0

agent:so i think if parents don't provide it's it's not going to be there|user:yeah|agent:and and there i don't think there's a lot of opportunity uh in the future for grants and loans and that kind of stuff because_1 i don't i just don't think it's going to be there	it's too hard	1
user:um|user:the only reason i even went to a budget was i found that we|user:and uh	we would	1
agent:sitting around that you can invest more in or do some other things that are a little bit more important|agent:uh than what we can pay for but i think if you do have a budget at least then maybe you'll have extra money|agent:money going out	yeah	1

agent:um-hum|user:i think the government uses is quite a bit|user:constitutes an invasion of privacy not so much the fact that the data is there but the way that it's being compiled and	you know if they they want to do a che[ck]- background check on you they've got	0

agent:uh you know [noise] see one in operation so|agent:that i[n]- in my lifetime i will see|agent:i d[o]- i do think that we're headed that way i think that there's a strong possibility	um-hum	0
agent:but that's i guess that's [noise] i had not thought about before so|agent:but uh|user:uh-huh	right	0
agent:[laughter]|user:[laughter-okay] [noise]|agent:i think i'm ready [noise]	okay	1
agent:and to make a change you know you have to make a splash but|user:you know they come in that way|agent:yeah	um-hum um-hum	1
user:um|agent:um what's changing them though is the economic situation where both|user:no	very much	1
user:um|agent:absolutely and so that's you know they sort of threw the thing back another you know ten years that they've had to you know restructure but i saw the greatest T-shirt the other day i got to get some for all my men friends it says let men run the world women have more important things to [laughter-do]|agent:men [laughter]	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|user:yeah yeah|agent:right and and you know just sort of all s[wooshed]- swooshed into one channel sort of thing it's it's viva la [laughter-difference] [laughter-someone] [laughter-said] [laughter-that] and and i think that you can truly respect the other person i mean you know Tom is just always saying what a mystery you are [laughter-you] [laughter-know] depends on	um-hum	1
user:right|user:yeah|agent:yeah well that's that's a very different way to do th[ings]- you know the woman doesn't start off at home raising the kids and goes back into her career you know twenty years later	right	0
agent:i- i tell you what i don't know what i would do without my friends having all their kids i just love the babies and and since i'm sort of in a medical situation where i can't do that it's|user:it's been real exciting|user:so	um-hum	0
user:um-hum|user:uh-huh|agent:i couldn't ask for a better life i mean if this is the way it had to be this is the best way i could possibly do it and and that has a lot to do with his strength and his	um-hum	1
agent:yeah but i wish they weren't so many i- i wish they weren't role models for everybody because|user:i do too i- i think uh now some some women can can do both they're very capable of working and and|agent:i think	a um-hum um-hum	0
user:yeah|user:oh|user:um-hum um-hum	yeah you mean it's stronger there	1
agent:working for her and then she has her business in the back|user:yeah yeah|agent:um you know -[a]mongst her peers be appreciated i think sometimes but then i'm not there so i don't know that and i have women that do both and i see a little jealousy on the part of you know the woman what has two little boys and and she has an au pair which is a live in college kid	ah	1
agent:uh-huh|user:uh well uh i have one daughter that works full-time she has two little boys|agent:that's true that's so true how how did your daughter do it	and they seem to do fine she has been talk[ing]- has talked about quitting you know and staying home for a few years	0
agent:and uh|user:right|agent:you know doing away with the the programming cards	yeah thirty years ago i i had a college job uh working as a programmer	0
agent:yeah and you can you can flip through the commercials so you don't have to watch the commercials|user:i tape it and then watch it when it's convenient and that way i don't have to worry about being interrupted i can just [laughter-put] [laughter-it] [laughter-on] [laughter-pause]|agent:yeah [laughter-i] [laughter-know]	right	0
agent:yeah|user:uh ten years ago i was working in a job at a medical center and i had to carry a beeper around and they were|user:yeah that's another one yeah car phones is a good point and uh cellular phones of all types and beepers	kind of bulky and all they did was	0
user:a journal article|user:i was writing a|agent:um-hum	uh	0
user:[laughter]|agent:yeah|user:and writing about medical topics [laughter]	and let's see twenty years ago i guess we're were just beginning to get into what they were calling the	0
agent:yeah|user:i do i really do i have uh|user:yep	four kids in college right now children and stepchildren	1
agent:yeah|user:and i guess the answer is is stay flexible because nobody can predict what's going to [laughter-happen] [laughter-in] [laughter-twenty] [laughter-years]|agent:um just kind of some of the changes that will happen even more so seems like it can't get much worse	i certainly wouldn't have been able to	0
user:yeah|agent:it's pretty wild|agent:[laughter]	and even you know that reminds me Federal Express was around ten years ago but it was used	0
agent:and uh especially come home every couple months|user:um-hum|agent:i know that's what uh what my family was talking when i picked up and moved to Texas from Indiana and they were like well you know twen[ty]- thirty years ago we wouldn't have done that you know	yeah	1
user:proba[bly]-|user:um-hum|agent:um and sale of drugs	probably right if you look at it from that stand point	1
agent:um-hum|user:twelve miles or so|user:i live in a little suburb uh which is i guess from Dallas is	but it's pretty congested	0
user:i would say the majority of it's happening during the day uh between|user:[noise] uh|agent:are they are there any theories on why this is happening	probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon	0
user:are the major targets guns|user:uh jewelry|agent:um-hum	that sort of stuff	1
user:[noise] yeah and and it's i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences|agent:right they're doing that in our state t[oo]-|user:course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever so they're giving the early release uh	uh	0
user:to|agent:[noise] um-hum|user:uh to convict somebody and then those convicted especially of you know murder and and uh you know major crimes uh [noise]	reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow-through with that	1
agent:well you probably sue him for mental anguish or something right and try to get money from him and|user:n[o]- no i'm not real familiar with that|agent:did you sue him under the civil system	oh	1
agent:um-hum|user:a real real possibility [noise] uh we've had a couple instances where break-ins where the the people have actually|user:and i think in our in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming	you know	0
agent:um-hum [noise]|user:yeah that's i mean that's certainly a a possibility an[d]- an[d]- we have had a a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death|agent:hear you break in and you're gonna get shot	and uh	0
agent:um there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it|agent:what i would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes|agent:i mean i i tend to agree with you i think uh	right	0
agent:um-hum|agent:yeah|user:well i agree i have d[one]- done something uh like that too only not n[early]- nearly as extensive	but it must be interesting now trying to	0
user:and uh so i tried to make it after i sold my business i in in|agent:um-hum um-hum um-hum|user:traditional looking particularly	i spent almost three years redoing	0
agent:that's where i need to [laughter-go]|user:and so i though[t]- well shoot i'm going to|agent:huh oh [laughter]	yes i'm going to the barn too	1
agent:yeah but but you did sta[gger]- stagger back and say oh doesn't this look nice|user:yes well it nearly killed me [laughter]|agent:oh i bet and what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way [laughter]	i hated to leave it	1
agent:as tight as you can that's probably because_1 they had you know every spring my mom says we're going to have a par[ty]- a barbecue and tell everybody guess what we're going to we're going to redo the [laughter-patio] you know we're going to pull up all the bricks but|user:an eighth of an inch or whatever you just put them together as close as you can|user:to leave like	um	0
agent:but um gosh you know i ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house um up up the stairway even|user:yes|agent:but uh i don't know of everything that i did i guess i enjoyed probably wallpapering the most and i thought that would be the hardest thing to do	wow	1
user:yes [laughter]|agent:and i guess i would fall more in the the realm that i like the sport issue of it but i i could give it up without too much trouble [laughter-it's] [laughter-not] the world's most pleasurable thing and it costs a bit to do it uh finding ranges and things like that um i have shot|agent:there's no particular reason to have them_1 at all and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it	right	1
user:uh having worked at one time in Baltimore or i don't know if you're in a big city|user:uh in just that instant and and i a lot of people say that they need it for protection|agent:right	are you	0
user:that's right|user:that's right|agent:person was coming your way if once you're surprised it's too late and and the rare cir[cumstances]- you know the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming and had time to do anything about it and	right	1
user:uh you know when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns it would be hard to decide but there are a few guns that uh just are not uh|agent:right|agent:um-hum	sport or	0
user:uh|agent:right|user:instead of using the money for where it ought to go it it's just it's ridiculous What kills me is when they had a chance to to uh put into ac[tion]- action the the G[ramm]- the G[ramm]- Rud[man]- what is it	the act where they had to cut everything across the board	0
agent:and it was ridiculous you know the whole thing and and you know they they asked him about it and|user:[laughter]|agent:and he was going to build it in his home town and they were going to hire a lot of people	yeah this is that's right	1
agent:yeah when you talk about the trillions of dollars on this and that our national debt in the trillions of dollars you know|user:no you can't even can't even conceive of what they're talking about|agent:well it's so much money and you can't even add it up you know that's why they think it's [vocalized-noise]	yeah	0
user:you know|agent:um-hum|user:uh eating us up	and get things on a on an even if it were if it were a family we'd be up before the	0
agent:i think that paying for school schools is the schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime and so i don't mind paying for school taxes even though my kids will be out of it you know|agent:i have two daughters one's in college already and one's about uh to be in high school but uh|agent:i think the now i- i don't understand the present school thing but uh	yeah i think that's right	1
user:yeah|agent:i- i think that's a wide open subject what i think that uh people need to take a stand i think the people will here shortly uh|user:so it's	well i think that's right if they don't do if they don't if they don't pull it in and start	0
agent:looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us you know|agent:we've had good water supply and that's due to the Corps of Engineers building|user:yeah	yeah they've done some good things	0
agent:[laughter] well it's been some interesting subjects yeah|agent:oh well great great okay|user:no i just [vocalized-noise] just a housewife i just heard about it and found it fun [laughter] guess i like to talk that's [laughter-all] [laughter]	right [laughter]	0
user:some of the so many problems i [vocalized-noise] i work in a high school are that kids don't have a a degree uh a of self-discipline which may be reflected|user:and i was expressing my frustrations that uh|user:yeah it's interesting because uh we're just having conversation on this uh with a couple of people yesterday	in society at large	0
agent:yeah|user:how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it|user:how	whether maybe through a commitment of the PTA	1
agent:yeah|user:that that's really scary|agent:right	but there are i think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve and this is something that i see	1
user:and uh|agent:right|agent:uh-huh	there really needs to be a bridge some sort of	0
agent:incredibly in[telligent]- intelligent underachievers|agent:uh|user:but it's	um-hum	1
agent:right|user:i mean i mean we're have to be we're alerted there's all sorts of systems where suicide|user:um there	uh predisposition i mean we're alerted to what the moment we see something if we see a child that we have any reason that's on drugs such as if he's got a beeper or they're if they're flashing lots of money around we've there are certain things to do i mean so tea[chers]- the school system's asked to do so much but	0
user:and parents frequently resent when you ask them|agent:how can you expect to|agent:yeah can you how can you [laughter]	is there a problem that we should be aware of	1
user:well uh a few i guess uh|agent:[noise] yeah i have what uh about yourself	i was trying to think [laughter] as i was asking you just exactly what movies i had seen recently i i	0
agent:oh they went another time though|user:now that was a good show my my wife and i enjoyed that a lot i think the kids did too we didn't go together though|user:yeah	yeah they well i got one runs around i got two boys and one boy runs around with one his group of friends and the other boy runs around with his group of friends i think both of them separately saw it at two different times even with their group of friends [laughter]	0
agent:yeah|user:i mean it wasn't a great show it's just a B movie|agent:okay	but it was fun i think uh	0
user:we went to see|user:uh you know we uh rather enjoyed trying to think of a couple of others that we went to see that|user:and uh it's funny it it really is	one movie i can't remember the name of it now though but it was uh	1
agent:like if we would go see a Von Dame movie|user:[laughter]|agent:you know so it's kind of hard for me to pick like a uh	uh-huh	1
user:Stallone just did a comedy incidentally that uh|agent:like the First Blood|user:yeah	i think's out now	1
user:and you talk about funny at least the little snapshot previews that they've shown on TV advertising it are hilarious i mean it is really funny|user:and he comes back as a woman|user:it's already out matter of fact it's been advertised on TV um about a guy that falls ov[er]- he he gets killed somehow or another	and uh so we're going to go see that	0
user:no no this this was a real uh|agent:oh okay this was a comedy so it probably wouldn't be the same one|user:but uh it was a real touching show about three sisters	uh sort of serious piece it had some light moments but basically it was a serious piece	0
agent:i would suggest that it's|user:no i haven't|agent:have you seen Awakenings with Robin Williams	have you seen that	1
agent:Rain Man|user:that Dustin Hoffman starred in|user:well did you ever see speaking of uh of uh medical oriented movie or at least a movie about somebody got rehabilitated did you ever see the one uh	yeah	0
agent:it sure it makes it true to life and everything|user:uh-huh|agent:Awakenings is very clean that was the only thing i didn't like about uh	rain man	1
user:oh yeah yeah|agent:like El Dorado is that one and uh [noise]|user:yeah me too	i like almost everything he yeah i really love rue Grit	1
agent:yeah that TV show or|user:was it Hogan's Heroes or|user:and that was uh uh not	Kelly's Heroes	0
user:uh the uh the uh [vocalized-noise] the opening and the closing score|user:but uh [noise] it's sung by the Herb Alpert congregation|user:and then they wind up at the end playing a tune that is just one of my favorites i've loved it for years and i'm sitting here as i tell you this trying to think of the name of it	of Kelly Heroes the	1
agent:and we color a lot and i read her stories and|user:yeah|agent:well i'm divorced but that's [laughter-what] when she's with me that's what we do	um-hum that's great	1
user:on your uh|user:and the communication helps you build|user:i think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot	helps j[ust]- just build your family	1
agent:yeah|user:yeah yeah and as i understand it i don't know i haven't experienced it but|user:um-hum	you know kids these days are growing up so much faster	0
agent:because she always likes to do things whenever the TV's off you know she'll forget about the TV completely|user:hm|agent:and and go out and do stuff you know	right	0
user:um you know there's a lot of|user:and now i think i think people are trying to get out of that at least and that|user:you know people aren't doing anything just sitting around you know no thinking involved	um i[t's]- it's becoming really health conscious	0
agent:she can't hit it in the air yet and then we kick the ball we play like soccer|user:yeah yeah|agent:w[e]- we just been hitting the ball on the ground	w[e'll]- you still have a lot of time before she gets	1

user:and it was i was it was so much fun to watch the progress because|user:but and|agent:oh yeah okay	as i	0
agent:that it's really makes a difference in my weight control|agent:when i walk i just i- i think i enjoy the scenery you know and i've always found it relaxing it's always something i've enjoyed doing [noise] and for me i've found that as long as i try to take almost everyday at least say a twenty minute walk or a half an hour walk maybe more if i can|agent:[noise] yeah the reason i ask is i've always really enjoyed walking and i know um you know i- i it doesn't bother me to take walks by myself i just	oh gosh yes	1
agent:[noise] oh yeah|user:when i lived in a colder climate i had access to one of those Schwinn bicycles|user:but uh	the ones that you you know you have to use your arms also	0
user:i guess it's like um|user:and what i had uh also found that|user:but as i said i'm not doing qui[te]- it quite as well now because we're in a temporary situation	certain addictions	0
agent:to start back again but once you really are into it i was definitely addicted to walking i had to have my walk everyday|agent:this walking everyday but it's really true once you haven't done it for a while it's very difficult|agent:and um i'm just i'm i'm doing better because i'm under control using medications so i'm getting back into	um-hum well and i w[ell]- i had support from my husband too which wa[s]- is very nice he	0

agent:i[f]- if you lock yourself out of your house and you try to get in your house|agent:i hear that you know it|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:now that's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor's got a noisy dog that's a deterrent because they know that that dog's going to bark|user:yeah very protective|agent:yeah Cocker Spaniels are loud [laughter] well there	um-hum	0
agent:[noise]|agent:{alrighty} bye-bye|user:okay bye-bye	[noise]	1
user:yeah that's right that's right or|user:yes|agent:that's uh editorials give you uh an insight into people's perspective of of issues better than you know it's really funny to look at somebody and say well i never really thought of it that way how could they think that [laughter-way] you know an [noise]	or to help you understand really how you think i think sometimes	0
agent:the uh radio has become uh|agent:right|user:uh settling my mind about things	pl[us]-	1

agent:and uh try their best to dedicate you know equal space here and there for an issue|user:yeah|agent:yeah that's nice to have anything that'll show both sides to something	yeah	1
user:right|user:it is|agent:yeah yeah that uh that that kind of power wa[s]- was was at one time flourishing in this country	right and i[t's]- it's such a valuable tool and and their should be some moral	1
user:yeah|agent:especially as fast as they can print these things these days some of my stuff comes every two weeks and then|user:i think that's true	yeah yeah	1
user:[noise]	do you have some kids getting ready for college	1
user:initial thoughts are going to have to sort of grade my advice according to uh|user:i think my|agent:uh	you know how much motivation and drive and uh	0
user:and uh so i had a fairly tough time getting through|agent:uh-huh|user:too good	and they presented me with a lot of material	0
agent:what the popular degree plans are|agent:instead of just what uh|agent:the the individuals interests are	right	1
user:was that i underestimated the amount of math|user:uh|user:i think one of the reactions i had	that was needed for an engineering degree	1
user:until i actually got to college|agent:right [laughter]|user:you know an enormous mathematical basis for all of this [laughter]	and so it was a bit of a slap in the face	1
agent:uh i agree i think that makes a difference uh|agent:yeah|user:were very personable and took uh a interest in people who were willing to study	and so i	1
user:to take uh solid geometry and the instructor there was|user:when i went to take solid geometry i had to uh commute to a a larger town to Allentown Pennsylvania|user:uh and	was sharp enough to know or to realize that	0
agent:oh boy well um i haven't been doing a whole lot of reading for enjoyment lately i read uh|user:tell me what books you read|user:[noise]	[laughter]	1

user:so i'm uh i was just thinking when they told me the topic i should just i should read the|agent:yeah|user:but i also get of course lots of references to neat stuff to read about	uh titles of the five books that are sitting on my desk right now that i'm in the middle of	0
agent:huh|user:uh those are all books that are out uh published and bound now but they're just things that|agent:so are you reading these in the form of just like printed manuscripts that have not been pub[lished]-	uh pertain to various things i'm working on or were uh mentioned prominently and attracted my curiosity so i got them_1 out of the library and decided i'd read some more in them	1
agent:since i'm um a therapist and all i've done recently a lot of research into some of the twelve step groups so i've got all the different alcoholics what they call the blue the blue book the big book|agent:trying to think of what else i've got uh|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:um-hum|agent:that's in uh Arizona who used to be in Dallas it seems like we have a lot of these that have been in Texas called PM Melody who does a lot of writing on codependency and she's got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and uh|user:yeah	hm	1
agent:oh wonderful|user:there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful but i was tickled to see that some publisher is uh reprinting those the James Thurber books for children|user:uh	the Wonderful O and The Thirteen Clocks that have been out of print for about oh i think about twenty years	1
agent:and i went to Lake Caddo|user:[noise]|agent:and since then i've gone to uh well i went to Mexico on one trip	uh-huh	1

agent:yeah|user:that yeah that's exactly was about twenty years now|agent:[laughter] Roberto died while we were down there as a matter of fact	um what was it like living there i mean did you find that people appreciated having the privilege of being	1
agent:i[t]- uh it a state but i would want a very very very clear majority because if the minority can be so vociferous whether you're talking|agent:i'm not so much against their making|user:pro or con in terms of making any type of change	uh-huh	1
user:[laughter]|agent:but they don't have to pay all the taxes and so forth that we do uh being that it's an island economy|user:um-hum	this is true	1

agent:all they want to do is make it acceptable which uh probably from a business standpoint is is what you want to do i guess|user:no that's true|agent:i don't think they consider it to be any uh particular reason to go out and have the very best in the industry	yeah well it's necessary to be competitive when i started work the they didn't have uh a dental plan	1
agent:that they will pay for so|user:right|agent:uh you know because they now have some some cancer screening test	well you see something	1

agent:yeah|agent:oh boy so you're an old hand at it|user:but uh i used to i was in Boy Scouts all through college and everything else so i was involved in a lot of camping you know when i was younger but	even my desires for camping have changed	0
user:yeah|user:[laughter] they|user:they	yeah really and truly that's that's that's more desirable course with my wife and daughter you know any kind of outing is is would be good just to get away and do it	0
user:i|agent:yeah so you know i think we'll pass on that one but|user:yeah that's that's a little extreme	but now you know uh	0
agent:it's hard to do without the creature comforts sometimes|user:but|agent:so yeah	yeah i'm pretty rusty at it anyway i don't i don't know how i'd fare nowadays	1
user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter] [laughter-i] [laughter-guess] [laughter] i'd like to think that anyway [laughter]|user:it's amazing how when you get older you get smarter	people actually call that fun	0
agent:yeah yeah that would be fun|user:i'd even i'd enjoy doing that myself|user:boy	but everybody i everybody i've talked to that has done that	0
agent:well [vocalized-noise] i h[ave]- you know hear like most of these people say things like going to you know Walt Disneyworld and stuff like that with their families it's more of a luxury kind of vacation than it is the|agent:yeah yeah|user:white rapids or whatever the white water you know raft rides and stuff like that	[noise]	1
user:[laughter]|user:[laughter]|user:yeah	[laughter] yeah	1
user:they|user:yeah she she looks like she might be an outdoors person eventually but|user:but she	both my wife and daughter take after each other they they get hot real easy	0
agent:hadn't been a whole lot here in the last several months i've been working so many hours|agent:okay that time is uh|user:okay tell me about the time you spend with your children i guess	yeah	1
user:thing for like the baby boomers is that they're uh|user:the new|user:i saw in the paper where uh	taking uh jobs that require less	0
user:better|user:do you find that it's uh|user:i don't well i don't have children but uh	i don't want to say better it's kind of obvious but	0
user:um|user:you know the|user:what about current trends around the country like for	about the you know like the the two the couple that	0
agent:son likes to hang around where i am because i'm here so seldom|agent:my|agent:whenever i'm home	um-hum	1
user:huh|user:uh-huh|agent:and if they are going to work those kinds of hours then i have to do that	-[be]cau[se]- i i was thinking i'm considering you know a career in in medicine	0
agent:i think that's very realistic|user:and|agent:oh i	yeah	1
user:like your peers you said you have to if they're going to work it you're going to have to work it too|agent:right|user:like you are	but like a physician it seems like you know they can pretty much	1
agent:but i'd of had to know it twenty years ago|user:okay|agent:i think so	right right	1
user:yeah|user:or too [laughter-tired]|agent:or too tired uh i don't i don't [laughter-know] that i'm too old but i'm too tired to start a third career	i know what you mean no i actually i don't but i can imagine	1
agent:<b_aside> i'm talking about that can you turn it off <e_aside>|user:spending time and and vet bills and stuff like that that okay yeah we'll get a dog you know well food you know twenty bucks a month or whatever no problem|user:uh	but uh	0
user:topic a little bit|user:hopefully in the future it'll be a serious dog but there again we steered away from the|user:uh	but uh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:my daughter is eleven and i look back on those times wh[en]- when we first brought her home from the hospital and she was a night person from day one|user:so	[laughter]	1
agent:are you newly married or|user:so [laughter-uh]|agent:[laughter-really]	um two years	1
agent:probably choose careers that are more um where they could manage their own schedule|agent:from the people i've talked to i don't know if i should bring this into it but um a lot of the dads said that they would|agent:um	uh-huh	1
agent:they like when i worked on second shift um their paren[t]- their kids go to school during the day and then they wouldn't see them at night because they would be in you know at work and the kids are going to be in bed|agent:it's really kind of sad some of the people that i work with|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:the future is um|user:but i think with the way|agent:uh	economy wise i don't think it's going to be realistic	1
user:um i i hope to|agent:what kind of things do you hope to do|agent:if i had kids well if you had kids	of course be able to teach them right from wrong i hope i hope to be able to spend	0
agent:do volunteer work and|user:and i'd i'd like to be able to do that i'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids|agent:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:huh i well i don't even think we [laughter-had] i don't even remember them being around when we were little|agent:huh|agent:[noise]	yeah i i see it seems like that's that's a big trend you know in the last	0
agent:oh yeah in fact most of the world liked them back then whether you did or not|agent:um|user:the Cowboys well they haven't done much for they never did much [laughter] even when Landry and Staubach were playing i'm being real sarcastic [laughter] did you like them back then	[laughter] touch yes	0
agent:well they've had some very good players and fact uh|user:well i don't know why i like the Bears but i do i just think they have some good players but|agent:yep	um-hum	1
user:yes|user:uh-huh|agent:the Cowboys' demise as i used to i used to watch it every weekend but irregardless of who was playing whether it was Cowboys or not but uh	it	1
agent:[vocalized-noise] it|agent:hum|user:[laughter] [noise] i have no idea	who is he who um the guy the young guy from uh Ohio State i think he's already over the hill isn't he	0
agent:now then there's a lot of dirty stuff going on on the line that the [vocalized-noise] that the referees don't call things get out of hand|agent:yeah i think it probably was the uh|user:[noise] yeah and it was competitive and it seemed a little cleaner i don't know um	yeah and there's some technical stuff you know this Minicam stuff these instant replay things that uh	0
user:usually when that happens and i mean it always seems to go the way of the ref's call though it never seems to go the way of you know|user:yeah usuall[y]-|agent:he admitted that he had done that after the fact but you could see it on camera when it happened but the officials couldn't see it	either the coach or somebody protesting	0
user:there you go yeah|agent:domestic engineering right right|user:domestic engineering	it's um	1
agent:well no i think it's mainly the offense the defense is better than the offense really the the|agent:yeah|user:so you think it's the defensive element that's really lacking in the Cowboys	uh-huh	1
user:yes|agent:there we are|user:[noise]	tell me what are some of the things that you did with your children when they were growing up	1
user:yeah th[e]- the boys tried those but they r[eally]- they did go in they started swimming when they were oh seven and eight and they really loved it and they're swimming both they'll be|agent:the sports after that|user:uh-huh	one is in college also swims in college and the other will continue to swim in college and they're fortunate they may even made nationals	1
agent:uh|user:in fact it's funny our vacations have always been um|user:yes	uh uh	0
agent:well it loo[k]- w[ell]- the one trend i would say is that with so many more women choosing professional careers there are fewer of them home in the afternoons and i don't think it needs to be the mothers but i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be|user:um yeah that's that's for sure that's for sure what do you do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see|agent:but it's not quite so much the hand holding and peanut butter and jelly [laughter-making] [laughter]	um-hum	1
user:because it was something that was|agent:right|user:when they for some reason they had they were bouncing something off of me	bothering them or they were concerned about and it was uh	0
agent:know quite often they were fifty miles away but|agent:uh close enough to visit my paternal grandparents|user:um-hum	yeah yeah	1
user:yeah that the trend of of families and time|user:yeah and i i just sort of think|agent:so uh they never played together or anything and there are only two of them_1 and they didn't live in the same town	where where parents are spending less time	0
user:from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until|user:um weren't able to do this year but we did that for e[ver]-|user:so this was one thing that we	uh our older son went away to college	1
user:and you wrap the present up and i mean the presents have gone from the days when they were very young|agent:oh i see|user:today as new as they did when they gave them to she gave them to us and there's a ring and you buy a present	to a little box of Band-Aid and an eraser and things	1
agent:for the grandmothers to be raising the children|agent:the trend in a lot of uh lower class areas|agent:and that is	yes yes	1
agent:wow|user:five thousand square feet with|agent:[noise]	a bunch of kids running around	0
agent:that are|agent:sixty and seventy thousand dollar homes|agent:the middle income people i think and the lower middle income they're that are hurting you know that	yeah	1
agent:um-hum|user:but it stimulated a lot of the builders to start building fancy homes|agent:uh-huh	and so we've got a lot of houses	0
agent:yeah oh really|user:are not selling|user:but an awful lot of these fancy homes	because they built them and put all this money into	0
agent:and it's just so regular and i just just don't have to worry about it|user:yeah|agent:so i have it done and i it's a best money i've ever spent is having it done	well sometimes it uh	0
agent:that's a shame that somebody let their yard she has poison ivy growing over her garage|agent:i'd run her out|agent:it's i saw it for the first time this morning what a eyeso[re]- eyesore that was i said	um	1
agent:uh-huh|user:sort of established sort of a no man's land here|user:and so they've uh	and so we don't get any traffic from Dulles over the house and we don't get any traffic from uh National	0
agent:oh okay|user:no i don't think so because_1 uh i saw just a little bit of the game today and he was out there playing|user:yeah	although uh i what i saw was at the end of the first quarter i think he only had like [eightch/eight] eight points	0
agent:um-hum|user:but uh when they had uh Akeem|agent:they're consistent	anybody who was old as that playing that well	1
user:and uh yet the Lakers continue to win so you're right i think they do really play much better as a team than they do uh|agent:uh-huh|user:and you go [thown/down] through and virtually every one of the categories there isn't uh a Laker in the top ten usually hardly a[ny]- uh any[body]- anybody in the top twenty except for like Magic	uh each one you know individually at their spot	1
agent:it really gets you know the i mean they're sleeping in different bed every night and|agent:so|agent:like you know and then they go on road trips and they do the same thing and and then they and then they stay out for two or three weeks at a time	yeah	1
agent:yeah and they don't wear any pads so i|agent:and they do[n't]-|agent:and	[laughter-yeah] really [laughter]	1
user:they were all like uh like six eight and|agent:uh-huh|agent:[laughter]	uh you know six ten	0
agent:so|agent:well here's a here's a guy from LSU Stanley Roberts he's seven feet tall and he weighs two hundred and eighty pounds|agent:oh yeah	God	1
agent:um-hum|user:you know and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the Mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage both the good and the bad|user:uh you know a video uh highlights of the season	i i don't know i haven't i didn't go down there last year	0
agent:Utah Portland Boston and Detroit|user:i can't remember them_1 all now|user:shoot	right	1
agent:um-hum|user:i tell you what those guys really hang tough|agent:yeah	you know i i'd like to see them_1 back up there again	1
agent:well and uh we felt the same way he was an institution and how how could they do that|user:i say that i support them there's been just so much that's happened to that team since they got rid of Tom Landry that was just like you know blasphemy around here [laughter]|agent:uh-huh	so	1
user:yeah|agent:and then we had Jerry Glanville who is guess is now in Atlanta and now we get the guy who was the University of Houston|user:yeah	uh-huh	1
user:yeah yeah|user:uh-huh uh-huh|user:right	[laughter]	1
agent:it seems like though uh it seems like all my teams always you know that i that are local to me wherever i live from when my husband was in college you know you just never on a given day they could do anything and then on another day but they the consistency just when it really gets down to the championship or or the really meaningful uh game|agent:so|user:yeah yeah	uh-huh	1
agent:so you have the teams that stay up on top for several years and then they start|user:yeah yeah and|user:yeah	yeah	1
user:so we'll see as i said i really think that they'll eventually|user:so uh that didn't go over well|agent:[laughter]	they'll eventually be a contender so	1
user:yeah yeah i mean you know you see you can definitely get involved in it more when it's somebody that you've supported all along and it's someone local because you've got all the press you know you read more about them of course and and hear more about them on on television and and such but|user:yeah|agent:or you know basically that's it or it's or it's some championship type games or something	uh i you know as much as i love it i would think that i would sit down and watch it but it just as i said for some reason it's like oh they you know they're just out there playing around they don't uh	1
agent:well Warren Moon broke his|user:uh last season he was out for maybe you know four or five games so|user:and uh he's making a fortune of course he didn't play that much	you know	1
agent:because we had the guy the i forget the guy's name the one who came in for him|user:yeah yeah you know it takes a it takes a strong leader in that position|user:yeah	uh-huh	1
agent:football hardly in her life and she sat there with me and i was explaining some of it to her and she was getting really excited and that was so neat yeah|user:uh-huh|agent:was there from uh they're from Alabama and my mom has never watched	uh-huh	0
user:yeah|agent:yeah you kind of i don't know you know when they're not doing well or they consistently do poorly just kind of kind of lose interest if you don't|user:you know as as we were when they were such a great team you know	yeah you know it's like wh[y]-	0
agent:yeah|user:playing such a a softy|agent:yeah	um	0
user:i live in Rhode Island so|agent:uh-huh|user:so he came i i actually i live in Rhode Island you know i work in Massachusetts because it's not that far away but	but no i didn't see that one i didn't um	1
agent:see i haven't seen many of those but i do like them_1 i mean|user:i don't know if you've did you|agent:uh-huh	you didn't see Two Thousand and One	0
agent:[laughter] yeah i've seen all those those are pretty good|user:two or three whatever|user:part	[noise] [laughter] yeah i like him i like	1
user:what's out there now|user:uh|user:i'm trying to think of uh	actually not	0
agent:they almost didn't make it back in a [laughter-couple] [laughter-cases]|agent:well they uh|user:or or they came back but they weren't really back	[laughter]	1
agent:[laughter-yeah]|user:and the like Friday the Thirteenth and them|user:uh	[laughter]	1
agent:Terminator|user:uh the Exterminator was it the Exterminator|user:well i[t]- it wasn't out it was uh	oh the Terminator where he came back from the future	1
agent:i'm going to have to get going but|user:hum|agent:i'm going to have to get going	oh okay	1
user:another uh|user:[noise] well uh|agent:[noise]	thing that i want to talk about is which of the the changes that you can think of	0
agent:uh if they're on the same level of responsibility now i would say that there's|agent:uh i would i'm not sure but i would think so within uh within a public accounting firm|user:do you think uh a woman CPA gets paid equally to a man	um-hum	1
agent:you know the movement of women into into the political arena as being very important uh|agent:and uh you know i- s[ee]- i see uh|user:Charlotte also has a woman mayor	well i'll tell you what worries me a little bit about uh	0
agent:you know may be earlier and then move into politics|agent:they will have had their family life and their business life|agent:if that's the the situation for women	uh-huh	1
agent:boat somewhere out in the Caribbean with you know with some|agent:congressman's not going to have her picture taken on a|agent:wo[man]- a woman	uh-huh	1
agent:okay thank you you too|agent:yeah it's been nice talking to you too|agent:and uh	bye	0
user:because i just i'm reading so much all the time|user:yeah i'm pretty much the same i uh i find that uh i'm a graduate student and i and i read a lot for school and i find i have no patience to really read a newspaper|user:uh-huh	and i really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast	1
agent:and you could always find some channel that had something on but you didn't necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time|user:yeah|agent:uh-huh	[noise]	1
user:uh which was a big disappointment i used to watch that was my if i|user:so i don't get CNN|user:that's um i've found that when i i don't have cable television anymore uh when i moved went back to graduate school i just didn't have the money to buy ge[t]- rent a cable TV line or whatever you know	wasn't home i'm a college teacher and sometimes i teach in the evening so i'll miss the evening news and uh you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on CNN i think that's	0
user:and uh because uh i i don't drive that much i only live about a mile from where i go to school and work|user:yeah i find i read very little i don't even get a regular newspaper|agent:yeah	i uh	1
agent:i have two kids over there|agent:yeah|user:so i i'm actually in Baltimore yeah you could say i'm in Baltimore	oh really in Baltimore	1
agent:oh no i'd i'd rather have Baltimore with the home town atmosphere|user:you know it there's really uh most people have relocated to the Washington area [laughter] you know|user:where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore	yeah that's i i like it i like it a little bit better too it's interesting though um to meet different populations i i'm just now	0
agent:crime problems that they're having there|agent:well most of what they're talking about in Washington is is the|user:it's so far removed from what i'm interested in	uh-huh	0
user:this position she was a state auditor|user:something like a [noise] uh state auditor or something like that before|user:national ties but she also was um	i guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the District of Columbia at Washington and then she left that to get a position with the Democratic party and now she ran for mayor so she's uh fiscally she's pretty tight	0
agent:yeah it's means they have to drive a little bit but|user:it's a nice area|agent:uh-huh	yeah well they might be car pooling too do they car pool in are they driven by themselves	1
agent:well i thank you for calling i have enjoyed it i really do like this program because i get to talk to people from all over the United States yeah|user:well i guess we should stop now|agent:so	uh-huh	1
agent:more against gun control than pro i think probably|agent:uh|user:oh yeah that's right	yeah	1
agent:[noise] this isn't just really great hunting country [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] you know there's not a lot of|agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	no	1
agent:you know ooh you know i i i don't go for that you know i|agent:you start talking about hunting and they just cringe and|user:oh yeah	yeah	1
agent:that's right|user:to me gun control is not going to control it but the parents|user:and went after his teacher and fired three or four shots uh at the school now	you know a teenager you know below eighteen or whatever the age should be	0
agent:you know the mercenary kinds of things i can't think of some of the names right off but i've heard them|agent:and and i understand that these magazines you know and whatnot that cater to that crowd are very uh|user:be allowed to buy an Uzi or something	oh yeah	1
agent:area uh um out off one fifty seven and you know those are just [es/extinct] extinct now|agent:uh|agent:whatnot that you could go to and out in Euless and	yeah	1
user:and of course when you go and take your targets down he's there to make sure that people|agent:yeah yeah|agent:yeah	uh that's what it was people did not t[otally]- totally unload their guns when you you when you take your targets down you walk in front of your own guns	0
user:and i think we have to look at it as it's not going to solve it next week we just got to look uh|agent:<b_aside> [vocalized-noise] not now [vocalized-noise] not now <e_aside>|user:or m[ore]- longer rather we came over with guns four hundred years i guess you might say	for the next ten or twenty years you know what kind of gun uh not controls gun uh legislature	0
agent:so we we traveled all over Europe|user:now there's a place i'd like to visit [laughter]|user:well	oh that's neat	1
user:uh-huh|agent:uh but we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip we had to have like eleven people for this package uh deal|user:uh-huh	oh uh-huh	1
agent:well my husband and i both like water so any any vacation that we go on is usually involves close to the ocean or or something like that|user:uh|user:of anything else	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:the New Jersey area too because the [noise] the lakes were really pretty close you know you could you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and|user:we loved the	just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and and just really	0
agent:no not yet|user:you have any children|user:um-hum	okay then that's probably one of the reasons our	0
user:uh|agent:uh-huh|user:one of one thing that happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family you know we go wherever somebody is that we haven't seen for a while [laughter] so that that's kind of uh we just came back from uh	Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate	0
agent:uh but it would have been nice it would have been a nice vacation|user:um|agent:met at a central place i i didn't go	we we've tra[veled]- we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile	0
agent:you know not be settled anywhere just see see the rest of the country|user:yeah|agent:a month here or a couple of weeks there and just	yeah	1
user:in Georgia or Florida|user:there are a lot of neat neat places to visit in America that's for sure we've i haven't been much to the south i haven't been in|user:yeah	or Mississippi or Alabama	0

agent:as long as i have a a shower nearby i'm fine [laughter] and electricity|user:yeah i find the outdoors very relaxing and you know kind of|agent:yeah i i do enjoy camping	a change	1
agent:they just didn't like what was going on|agent:i know we used to live in Garland and a lot of the people there sent their kids to private school because um|agent:yeah and they're already paying for it i mean i you know um	yeah well it costs uh so much in taxes here	0
user:right|agent:um i had a really good education but it wasn't where i went to high school it was an inner city but it the faculty was very good|agent:and i went to school in Chicago so i can tell you it's probably the same type of thing that	uh-huh	0
agent:you know i would send a child there|agent:the ones in Richardson and i think well|agent:i don't know i just look at high schools like Plano East and West and	well the good school districts here do have honors programs	0
user:and that doesn't include their personal expense|agent:oh my goodness|user:well h[e]- he said about six hundred a month	so you're you're talking about uh college uh level fees here	1
user:no|agent:and i don't know i don't think we do enough of that here in terms of getting children to think independently|agent:uh a study unit would be	i can relate to part of that uh in in my high school uh	0
agent:i don't know i think of two or three things in my mind i think teachers should be tested|agent:i mean i wouldn't want to be growing up now a days that's one thing um but i don't know how you solve that you know those are social problems the academic problem|user:because his performance at school had degraded so much	i i believe in that	1
agent:[noise]	okay	0
agent:you know the issues are|agent:and i'm not sure how much that holds true anymore i think|agent:the Democrats were the doves they were more for peace	okay and you vote for the Democrats or	0

agent:from Massachusetts|user:Dukakis|agent:no it was Dukakis	okay didn't he have a woman or wasn't or was that Reagan	1

user:but i|user:yeah|agent:oh do you yeah that'll tie you down a little bit [laughter]	i don't know	1
agent:uh-huh|user:Hart was running|agent:Hart	a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking not that i think he was good looking but	1
agent:i think everybody does it just depends on how well you can hide it [laughter]|user:i'm sure there's a lot of people that have had|agent:um-hum	yeah	1
agent:but he actually all right [laughter-this] i thought he was great [laughter]|user:um-hum|agent:well i think that was part of it i think there's a lot of the the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the the recession and stuff people just had a picture of Carter as not being real capable	i thought Carter was good too and that was	0
agent:who who was in that|user:yeah it's|agent:Five Heartbeats	it's uh Robert Townsend movie	1
user:history and things like that and the way they went from from how they went from stardom to|user:their life and their uh|agent:[noise]	non [laughter-stardom]	1

user:it's|agent:did you ever see Kindergarten Cop|agent:but um	no i never did	0
agent:um-hum|user:it was pretty scary because i was visiting a VA Hospital|agent:yeah	uh near to where i live and they were saying that some of the patients there you can't leave by themselves because_1 they'll make a weapon out of anything	0
agent:to see it in a little while here but it's been out for a while|user:um-hum|agent:yeah i'll probably try to go s[ee]-	oh very good	1
agent:because it's a macho movie|user:i don't know some macho title [laughter] that's why i i just don't like the|user:i don't know some	yeah it is i i d[on't]- i don't like that a lot i don't watch a lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger or anything like that either	1
agent:i haven't heard much lately i just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews|agent:i haven't|user:was that good did you see it	um-hum	1
agent:and uh they have F FX 2 out|user:um-hum|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:that's probably true i i i just|agent:[noise]|user:but it doesn't seem like it's as big uh rage to get to the movie theater as it used to be	um-hum	1
agent:you know or school board wide or you know what i'm saying narrow the topic a little and|user:okay|agent:city wide	oh	1
agent:for our city council|agent:we've just gone through some city elections here in in Plano|agent:we've uh	for city council do you all have a mayor or	1
user:as far as in the local like our [vocalized-noise] our our our our chief of police is a woman our our mayor is a woman our s[uperintendent]- superintendent of of schools was a woman she's just now you know|agent:yes|user:okay i don't know is [vocalized-noise] would a trend does it seem to be we're having more minority type people women in government	been pushed out	0
agent:uh-huh uh-huh|user:and they just she just lost out to someone from the Dallas area like assistants somebody who's an ass[istant]- one of the assistants in your|agent:uh-huh	i'm not sure what the name maybe it was another woman	1
user:yeah but but then again you know it would be nice to have more you know the majority of teachers|user:so|agent:oh that's excellent excellent you know that they're getting a chance	seem to be women it would be nice to have	0
agent:and then you know work on that and if you want to work on up but you still can make good money|user:right|user:substitute	uh	1
agent:and not just private enterprise|agent:originated|agent:government uh	uh-huh	1
user:because in the past you know it seemed like i can remember people just just throw it down they don't care|agent:uh-huh|user:you know when you have an event like that of course everybo[dy]- you know there's just food and everything else and of course they have the the you know the places to throw the stuff but you really they were really use they really use it and the	but you're you're finally getting to the point where it's just kind of second nature to find some place to to throw it	1
agent:yes yes|user:yeah it really hasn't been that long i mean it's probably twenty years or so that you know it really began|user:so it's uh	so	0
agent:no no|agent:bu[t]- but|user:yeah they didn't quite make the play-offs though	but	1
user:pass around and|user:they just uh work the ball and uh|agent:yeah yeah	make each other look good	1
user:okay_1|agent:yeah and he played really well when he was there so|agent:yeah	yeah	1

user:um|user:yeah i like to um i don't have a boat but i like to fish and there's a lot of lakes around here|agent:so you like to fish huh	are there many lakes up there	1
agent:um|user:and uh you know they wash when they open up the dam and let out water they wash down the fish and uh you catch that white bass and crappie out of there|agent:yeah	every once in a while there'll be striped bass	1
user:yeah it's sometimes i use corn but uh|agent:they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded these large schools|agent:they'll corn or salami or bread or anything they'll they'll	uh some fish steal it off the hook sometimes	1
user:it's he was fast|user:so he was in a bad way but uh|agent:wow	he's uh	0
agent:um|user:but uh i haven't eaten anything else|user:um catfish yeah	you know	0
agent:yeah|user:uh not yet my brother went off the coast of Maine uh when the i don't know what they Mackerel that school out there|user:yeah	it's he he said that it was just like that [vocalized-noise] they were throwing like uh uh hell benders or uh	1
agent:but this is great because_1 it was i think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something|user:yeah|user:yeah	um-hum	1
agent:yeah it has really been a lot of fun uh we found some guys that actually you know worked for a Mercedes dealership and uh they also repair them for other the people on their off time|agent:and it|user:oh that's great your husband uh i'm i'm a hobbyist too i like to work on cars too	oh that's good	1
agent:and uh i don't know i think it just soured me on it for some reason because i had trouble with it starting the engine [laughter-blew] up in it i had to replace the engine when it was only two years old so|user:yeah|agent:yeah yeah i i have always had an American American car and uh i had a real real bad experience with the Cougar that i had it was an eighty two Cougar	yeah	1
agent:they've scaled everything down so much and uh i have i don't i've never owned a really large car i don't know i think that Cougar was the biggest thing i ever had and|user:right|agent:yeah it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again you know they had	well even the Japanese cars are bigger too but uh	0
agent:oh okay because i have a|user:oh yeah it was a month or so ago|agent:now when when was this when this was this recently	well they have it every year	1
agent:really crazy about {Jags} for a while and the convertible what is it XJS or something like that and i you know thought that's a dream car and and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant you know i|agent:oh yeah you know i could fine i- i was|user:and i could buy anything you know	yeah yeah	1
agent:and um it i live in an apartment|user:uh-huh|agent:[noise] so they've been doing that it for a while now	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:we we have out here|agent:[vocalized-noise] no and that's what i- i don't understand exactly why they don't have that option	uh up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way they had some bends	0
user:uh-huh|agent:that you know you can just pop your cans in and near the Xerox machines they have places you know for your paper|user:uh	yeah	1
user:when i when they say|user:do a little more i'd like to know for instance|agent:um-hum	uh plastic	0
agent:right right and before even at work before they started the recycling plan which at work they've only been doing since January first of this year i had had everyone in my department recycling and you know i would have them drop|user:now that gives you a little bit of incentive there uh-hum|agent:you know because the other public	saving them for you huh [laughter]	1
agent:[noise]	[noise]	1
agent:uh we had a friend give it to us|user:no did no did you catch the fish|agent:oh the mud dog	uh-huh	0
user:the black lab that's a female it tha[t]- it's it's the most wonderful animal we've ever had an i- when she was about three years old|user:probably five or six years and unfortunately|user:quite a long time uh	we noticed that she was having pro[blems]- uh problems limping and so forth and	0
user:well no i'm not sure that's the situation but|agent:oh is that right|user:but i think i don't know apparently they've been so in well i don't know inbred or what but	it um for those dogs that are registered and if if you should have one	1
user:when i- uh let's see winter before last|user:i have had just wonderful luck with this lab uh|user:well uh	we would bring her in and uh when it was cold	0
user:that's when we lived in Oklahoma|agent:oh yeah|user:and you know in i'm i'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this but you because you all the time you know run into people with [vocalized-noise] problems anyway	and uh	1
user:uh|agent:does he get is he an inside dog also or does he just run out in the backyard is he fenced in|user:and uh it's just wonderful	um well we're living now in an area where we	0
agent:oh definitely|user:well he has been trained and you've kee[p]- you've kept u[p]- it up haven't you|user:well he's been	yeah it is wonderful i i have some neighbors across the field	0
agent:i'm not for sure [laughter]|user:well have we been talking five minutes|user:[laughter]	i'm not either but	1
agent:um yes i do|user:so but i have a hard time getting anybody because i guess do you work|agent:i mean i	yeah and probably just got home	1
agent:i've lived in this area for about twenty six years|user:how long have you lived there|user:and	okay well you're familiar then very well with what's going on there	0
user:uh-huh|agent:the the social people pick it up on a separate day and they said that was paying for itself It was paying the extra salaries for those people as well as paying you know the city for doing it|agent:um garbage or you know	well good	1
user:problems that uh some of the recycling centers are having because of the slick magazine pages in with the newspaper which|user:i've read articles here uh about the confusion involved in what is to be put out and what isn't and the|user:that is nice and	they say ruins the whole batch and	1
user:right|agent:with arrows uh and that indicates it can be recycled but there are different grades of plastic and that's probably what you're talking about sometimes some of those plastics cannot be reused in certain ways some can now even our grocery stores here we have two different large chains that|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:uh located throughout the city and we've|agent:yes i am surprised yeah|agent:huh	called and finally found one but it's about uh	1
user:that that was sort of my point too in addition to being a a good focal or central collection point|agent:and uh but i think the adults are the ones that have to lead the way and they have required the the students in the cafeterias to recycle but of course you know tha[t]- it doesn't go all the way they they make the effort they try but i think as the younger children come on maybe they'll be a little more conscious of it and eventually|agent:in the schools they are trying to make students more conscious	it does raise the awareness if you do it through the school system	0
agent:well i enjoyed talking to you and i w[ish]- i wish you luck there in Charlotte|user:yes i am too i am too well Linda i enjoyed talking to you|user:well i	thank you	0
user:yeah i um|agent:coming to supporting it|agent:but the state legislatures are more and more	i	0
user:yeah and Texas is having a problem right now and it's the the|agent:uh upwards uh thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them|user:uh-huh	the the the repeatable cri[me]- i think that's the the [vocalized-noise] repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they're they're patrol the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done	0
user:uh-huh|agent:oh a police investigation you have to have references and i know because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference|agent:you have to have uh	uh-huh	1
agent:the situation|agent:that sure there's an end to th[e]-|user:but it does serve as a pun[ishment]- uh definite pun[ishment]- you know lasting punish[ment]-	right in that particular instance um	0
agent:and uh now the Air Force is the largest employer in the uh area and uh|user:uh-huh|agent:uh have a lot of heavy industry but it's kind of uh all the industry has gone south	sure	1
user:yeah i just don't think that uh you can rehabilitate i mean i just don't uh|agent:pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and with a smile on their face as they did it|user:uh-huh	oh i did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class and i just	0
user:it's more than aren't uh that|user:i'm not even sure in the split among the fifty states do you know which way it is the ratio|user:yeah	it's more that don't have it isn't that correct	1
user:ho[w]-|agent:c[an]- tell from your accent|agent:oh well ye[ah]-	how about you	1
agent:well i|user:uh then i uh|agent:uh-huh	[noise] then i put my two cents in	1
agent:well that would be nice yeah|user:uh|user:and it's fairly small and you and most of the people you tend to know at least the family or you know	it's uh	1
agent:what's real i guess|agent:you don't know|agent:well that's what i mean it's just	yeah how about uh bond issues or referendum that they they put on	1
user:how how long have you lived in in|user:um|agent:well see i've never heard of that well i know that sounds stupid but i really haven't i've never heard of that	where are you now T[exas]- in Dallas	1
agent:right it's about the same|user:yeah so you're in the same boat there|agent:cities in this part of Texas	and you don't really know who's who are what's going on or	0
agent:uh-huh|user:that way they don't get in there because some of these guys have been in there like for twenty years|user:the the terms of office to no more than two years i mean two terms	and they	0
user:oh the [vocalized-noise] like uh|agent:well i want to know about politics in particular you know just you know what the workings of it is|user:uh	uh	1
user:um i don't even think running t[o]- to|user:there's too many special interest groups now that are in there that that can sway an election one way or another|agent:uh-huh	the running of	1
user:no one's held accountable anymore for things that happen|agent:uh-huh|user:their ball game they've been in there so long and if you don't then they'll you know they'll find ways to get rid of you	well	1
agent:you know that whole mess|agent:it ran through my head that Carter lost because the hostages|agent:when Reagan came in i fig[ured]- i thought	yeah yeah	1
agent:uh-huh|user:yeah because you because it might give you uh an insight|agent:i don't know i could check into that	you know	0
agent:right|user:well i have a lot of them but i don't use them very much though [laughter] i use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes uh|agent:do you have a lot of credit cards	tuition if it's	0
agent:right|user:helpful plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes|user:you know not immediately handy i think uh they're very	but uh i you really do need to be very	0
user:uh|user:but uh it's true you have to be very careful or you end up|agent:uh-huh	going in the deep end and	0
user:you didn't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying|agent:yeah|user:even before it probably wasn't though because you didn't get anywhere near as much as what it	so	0
agent:so we just pay it off without having to worry about any interest or anything|agent:and then at the end of the month all the money's there covered already|user:uh-huh	oh that's a really good idea	1
agent:oh okay i'm in uh i i work in psycholinguistics actually|user:yeah uh well uh in information systems i'm a voice researcher|agent:uh oh really in what field	uh-huh	1
user:um-hum|agent:what i think is a lot of money to go to a karate class you know for the you know i pay up through the year|agent:i uh [noise] i i go to uh i pay	yeah but you need a hobby	1
user:yeah|agent:[vocalized-noise] always soft [vocalized-noise] you know uh so so that's helpful|user:oh i think so she's always soft that's true	yeah	1
user:i think we'll do much better when we're living together and we're only paying one rent|agent:well that'll kill you yeah|user:it uh it gets tough but i	and one telephone you know w[ell]- it'll cut our telephone bills	0
agent:um|user:yeah|agent:she's real good at you know sort of saving and	i don't i don't argue with her but i just get all i guess i i it must show on my face	0
user:um-hum|agent:you know you don't even think about it if it's gone you know so uh until you really need it and then all of a sudden you realize you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else|user:yeah you don't notice it i think that's probably a really good idea	yeah	1
agent:we went and lived with friends you know this and that and and then the whole ice storm cost us still quite a bit of money even though insurance picked up some of it|user:right|agent:just to bring the tree down i mean just to take off what was broken there plus	yeah	1
user:i also think that i think there's a little bit um|user:yes and you know you said um along with salaries|user:um-hum	that can be	1
agent:i think the educational opportunities have made some difference uh because at one point i know my mother-in-law use[d]- uh talked about when she went to college she really sort of had to to do her own way because although she was one of three daughters um and while her parents were um very supportive in many ways they didn't really seem to have the um|user:but um|agent:um-hum	yeah	1
agent:um-hum|user:well my mother i my parents are older because my siblings are all older i'm the youngest of older siblings and my mother um was|user:right	had the uh had three sisters and one brother	0
agent:somewhat uh less uh technical jobs or y[ou]- you know too perhaps uh you know start working their way up but i don't think it's quite as um|agent:until they work their way up and i don't think very many young men are ask to do that although perhaps they are asked to do|user:no it is it is	um-hum	1
agent:um|user:um-hum|user:that's true yep	but y[ou]- it's it's i've always heard i- i don't know if you know this joke it's uh it talks about um this this	0
agent:yeah|user:oh what was oh you know one other place is um women in the Army|user:right um	that i think that's really changed a lot	0
user:um-hum|user:um|user:[vocalized-noise] yeah	um-hum	1
user:yeah|agent:oh yeah it it's very difficult so that needs to be done and ed[ucation]- perhaps education will eventually do it but uh the idea that that all those uh things that were traditionally thought to be the housewife when she was home as a housewife are still hers even if she's out working uh you know that's a serious problem uh|agent:right	right	0
agent:is a musician so he does uh was uh|user:uh-huh um-hum|agent:uh and the wife is is out with the more uh uh nine to five kind of job and then the husband in one case is a	oh	1
agent:no [laughter] been playing on my computer|user:did i interrupt your reading schedule|agent:nope [laughter]	[laughter]	0
agent:um-hum|user:well uh i'm at a stand still right now but uh um we haven't lived in Charlotte very long|agent:what books are you into	and so uh and our furniture is stored somewhere else so i've had a lot of time i've read a lot of books	1
agent:um-hum|user:for to come out|user:and her last one which i think w[aited]- everybody waited about a year or two	uh uh Plains of Passage	1
agent:Power that Preserves and have you ever read those by Donaldson|agent:the last series i read was|agent:uh	yes i have	1
agent:and artificial intelligence|user:uh-huh|agent:neural networks	uh-huh	1
agent:um-hum|user:and they really needed he's an accountant also|user:uh	and so they needed someone to uh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:as good at troubleshooting as anybody|user:but he he's you know he he's good at and he's probably uh	that you can find	0
user:and i believe that it's|agent:hm|user:and it's called Women of Substance	one of also one of the best books that i've ever read	1
agent:uh-huh|user:or somewhere like that|user:oh the Y	and	0
agent:all right i'll remember that all right|user:if i didn't do anything else i recommended a good book to uh a[nother]- another woman|user:and if i uh	okay	0
agent:right|user:um like my husband works and i do so i don't take some of i have certain things that i take and he has other things he takes|agent:yes	so i mean in that kind of situation	0
agent:yeah actually they're from Canada they're Canada based|user:are they a big company or|user:uh-huh	uh-huh that's see that's probably why because_1 Cana[dian]- Canada has the the um government run health care systems social medicine	0
agent:right|agent:um-hum|user:but then you know like a lady in my office said she said her husband works for TI too and she said what about the people that are walking around and i hope uh i don't you don't sound like you're in this category but i mean for extremely obese people or something	the kind of people that can't sit in the airline airplane chair you know	0
agent:to[tally]- totally vested|user:[noise]|user:yeah	oh my goodness	1
user:u[m]- not EDS TI um|agent:uh-huh|agent:yeah yeah	but i i don't know i think everywhere they just need to uh sit down and hire	0
user:and the other thing i think is really good is that EDS is much better than TI at i think right now that that we have day care um|user:yeah they really should because_1 they're big enough um|agent:they should be though	they uh the health the h[ealth]- the health program	0
user:so i don't know i guess it's just where they um|agent:people yeah|user:in terms of the number of employees so i	and like EDS reimburses you for adoption	0
agent:uh price of homes has went up dr[astically]- drastically like an average house is now a hundred thirty thousand|agent:and homes that are|agent:uh me too because you know with utilities and	oh j[ust]-	1
user:um|agent:um economic uncertainty is better than what most of the country is|agent:Dallas as far as	this is true	1
agent:yeah|user:the execution of their job|user:to their um	you know	1

agent:right i guess uh uh i've ha[d]- i have had some thoughts in the past that uh this this service should not be|user:so uh you know uh uh the idea's great where does the money come [laughter-from]|user:serve for a year in any capacity	an[d]-	1
agent:right|agent:yeah|user:great but then who pays and if they have to and they don't go into the lab[or]- the other labor force you're losing money in terms of taxing	from other jobs i mean so there's it's not	0

user:we have uh probably what's considered the third worst|user:this is a farming community and the farmers control your property taxes basically and and in a sense you services|user:we don't pay much in taxes i don't uh this sets	maybe the fourth worst school district in uh	1
agent:and uh it's a colonial house that we have it's a saltbox|user:um-hum|agent:no uh a third of an acre	yeah	1

agent:yeah we got volunteer i mean uh we used to have volunteer up here|user:two or four full-time then everybody else is a volunteer|user:so there's like a core of like each station has like	yeah	1
agent:oh yeah|user:we have a plant here that feeds one of the military contracts that should be cut you know that they advised on cutting|user:you know after Desert Storm or whatever	but because of Desert Storm now they said well we can't cut it so they put it back in action now granted everybody around here was happy because it keeps two or three hundred people employed	0
agent:and|agent:yep|agent:right	in some ways i just don't	1
agent:it's being channeled into special action groups by special action groups and|user:you know it uh it just it could be put on the top of automobiles to|user:it could be it could be put on the top of airplanes to help power the plane	right	1
agent:um|user:and highways|user:[noise]	see that's a big problem we have um i'm originally from Pennsylvania	0
agent:do you work [vocalized-noise] do you work for Texas Instruments then|user:uh-huh|agent:oh oh you are	[laughter]	1

agent:and upstairs we have a bath a bath oh we have a half bath downstairs too we have a bath upstairs and one two|user:uh-huh|agent:and a pantry	uh-huh	1
user:um but it's just again the the privacy you know um|agent:uh-huh|user:yeah it is i mean i would never buy it but leasing it is fine [laughter]	we had a house in Minneapolis that was on three acres and my husband was raised um on a working farm near Dayt[on]-	1
agent:in the Mount Lebanon area|agent:uh|user:what part what sections are they in	yeah that's nice	1
agent:uh-huh uh-huh|user:it's really i mean a and and it's hard to sell the properties people from JC Penney's from New York came here about a couple of years ago|agent:oh yeah yeah	and they thought they were getting a great deal	0
agent:well we've we've been looking for about you know two years to decide but you know with the style changes you know they're they're a lot of them are changing right now and we're trying to wait until we see what what it's going to you know the style going to stay for a while|user:you you sound like you've been looking recently or you're [noise] buying [noise] soon|agent:it just doesn't have quite as much room and it's not very comfortable to drive long distance in	um-hum	1
user:half of me wants some sort of little sporty thing just for the hell of it because it may be the last time i can drive one for a long time|user:we prob[ably]- i'm i'm sort of stuck i want|user:which basically our our our our plan is to wait another year until i'm done with graduate school and then sell the Bonneville for whatever we can get for it and go out and buy anoth[er]- a a new car some place else and i think	and the other half of me says be pragmatic and get some sort of	0
agent:you can lean it back a little bit but not all the way|user:oh okay|agent:whereas now it can't	right	1
user:they and and they had a job and they called me basically i basically i was shopping the agent to make sure you know he was doing good things by Range Rover you know|user:but just but but because um my my wife works for a temp[orary]- agency and|agent:[laughter]	they sent me out as a to sort of	0
agent:yeah i agree i don't think even if i had the money to spend on it i don't think i'd buy one|agent:it's a little stiff|user:forty thousand d[ollars]- yeah that's just way too much for for a jeep	in my opinion	1
user:it was amazing|agent:i uh i- i like i say i d[on't]- i think even if i had the money i wouldn't want something like that it's just not within my it's just it's impractical|user:and the man claimed that he sold fourteen of these Mercedes the previous year	yeah	1
user:right|agent:it's still mechanically fine now you you know there there's there's money to invest in it during during that three hundred thousand miles you know uh timing chains and and various other things but all in all if you if you take it mileage uh based on what you spent over that life of the car|user:and the car's probably still fine right	it's wonderful	1
agent:but the little that eighty two Bonneville that you have that that uh that's probably a pretty good car|user:that's that that that's real true actually|agent:so uh it it's it's crazy so	that's that's actually it's got um it's actually it's low on mileage given that that it's eighty two it's only got seventy five thousand on it and uh	1
user:the air conditioning sort of blowing warm air so i went down to the you know my local mechanic and for forty dollars they did an air conditioning check and they|agent:yeah|agent:it's crazy	went through everything i told them to put in a shot of Freon and they said yeah it needs a shot of Freon but then he came back and he said well the reason you're losing the Freon is because you have a leak in this condenser line and	0
user:which i'm not sure if you've ever heard of or not but uh|agent:um-hum|user:rust proofed by a company called Rusty Jones	Rusty Jones went out of business	0
agent:oh well then i'm sure we're going to have a lot in common [laughter] i'm just joking|user:probably [vocalized-noise] cutting edge rock would be the best way to describe it|user:uh i like uh	[laughter] good deal	1
agent:it just seems like instruments playing all at once to five different scores of music do you know what i mean like didn't seem like it was meant|agent:well the the thing that i hate really is music that um|agent:oh okay	yeah	0
agent:oh|user:[laughter-no] i'm musically|agent:do you play any sort of instrument	destitute	1
user:yeah|agent:like sitting in your car for an hour just to get out of the parking lot|agent:i know and then by the time you leave you end up	we usually go down and there's a tower that they have downtown you go down	0
user:like i say i haven't been down there to a concert since|agent:yeah|user:and it's it's okay the the acoustics could be better but	jeez i don't remember who i went to see last	1
user:oh i'm trying to think of a good example|user:and|agent:like who are some of those bands what are they called	one that won't get me into too much trouble	0
agent:probably yeah|user:she'd be entertaining to see perform|user:i think	but i don't i don't really care for her music there's one or two songs that i like	0
agent:[laughter]|user:i [laughter-won't] [laughter-say] i make tapes to listen to in my car but|user:i don't i don't	occasionally i put on LCD and	0
agent:take care|user:[noise]|user:[laughter] all right	okay bye	1
user:yeah i think trial by jury is very good i actually they said i think the tape said something about changing uh|agent:but i think trial by jury is it's a lot better than leaving it up to one person|user:i don't i don't i don't even know what to do about that sort of thing	changing it such that that	0
agent:and everything|user:right|agent:i don't know you pe[ople]- too many people can take vendettas out on people	right	0
user:one person thinks that that they're not guilty and they|user:i mean that's sort of a strange case because_1 i wonder what happens when eleven people thinks someone's guilty and one person doesn't|user:for having it what about you know about being unanimous	can't decide for hours unless they convince that one person you know	1
agent:to you know just say he's guilty so we can get out of here and go home|user:yeah saying|agent:you know bombarded by all the other eleven jurors	yeah	0
agent:yeah bec[ause]-|user:right and they can't do anything about it|agent:jus[t]- directly after the trial they found out he really was guilty and he couldn't be tried again	yeah i often wonder about that i wonder if	1
user:for instance you can't um|user:yeah well well there's also the issue of|agent:[noise]	you can't uh	0
agent:well you're allowed to show their character do you know what i mean and if it shows that their character's you know|agent:because it's it|user:for good	right	1
user:who are|user:they just go you know they're you've got people like who are uh|agent:right	you know lame lame ducks and they sort of don't care about anything and just want to go ahead and	1
user:i'm not sure if they had one yet but i'm sure they will um|agent:well did they have a T V movie about him|agent:no	because he was he was on some sort of news special though he was	0
agent:i think my sister is married to a guy from Rochester|user:eleven and twelve women at least|user:they they they realized later he he'd killed about between	and	1
user:and should just be locked up for life|agent:well of course but they need to do something with him he needs to be annihilated [laughter]|user:i mean it's clear to me the man is insane	right i mean i don't know what you do with them at that point if you're that crazy but what what struck me is you know they had a psychiatrist testifying for hours and hours	0
user:for some really strong gun control measures but|user:well i tell you i'm i'm|agent:well what do you think about gun [laughter-control]	i mean that opens a lot of questions that i don't have any answers [laughter-for]	0
user:b[e]- be able to find a way to get the guns but i think in a lot of domestic [vocalized-noise] uh disputes and a lot of family disputes um|agent:um-hum|user:but i- i think what would happen though is that yes you would have a certain type of criminal a certain criminal element that would um [noise]	i'm not sure that those people would be able to get a hold of the guns	0
agent:and uh you know with my wife and daughter|user:you have|agent:well the reason i say we were uh we personally have experienced a major crime in our family	uh-huh	1
user:but yeah that's the that is the thing see as [vocalized-noise] in the past say five years i've evolved from thinking|agent:uh|user:um-hum yeah	no i'm really i'm so much of pacifist that	1
user:just i don't think that's it will i'm sure|agent:yeah i assure you it it can it can and and the chances|user:i allow myself to think well it will never happen to me or it won't happen to m[e]- you know i'm not going to have to deal with that and i	yeah	1
agent:committed against them_1 now it's one out of every four or five for just a a crime|user:right|agent:has and i'm talking about a major crime	right	1
agent:and you know they they physically were not harmed in any way they were very lucky|agent:yeah|user:well they don't have to use them [laughter-in] [laughter-that] case i mean they just have to have them_1	they weren't yeah	0
agent:but that's his normal style i mean that that's what he would do in a in a confronted situation|user:yeah|user:one person yeah	yeah yeah	0
user:um-hum|agent:out of cold blood the chances are they would do it again because they feel no remorse|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
user:that uh have raped several times or child|user:they're taking criminals who are repeat offenders and i mean really repeat offenders|user:prison reform that's going up in Washington state or Oregon or someplace up there where	molesters that have molested several children over and over again	0
user:no|agent:i and that and and i hate to say that but i- i mean it's it's just you they they violate your family of course at that point you don't have much to lose and i ha[te]- and i- like i said i really hate to say that but i think that i would be that uh|user:yeah i- i understand that	that's right	1
agent:to help themselves some they have by being extra careful|user:um-hum|agent:or detectives or whatever you know and the people have to learn to	right	1
agent:um-hum what do you think about what do you think about the the lower grades you know K through seven|user:all three of them|user:well i guess um i'll start out and that is um i don't know what section of the public school system they're talking about whether it's the first eight grades the high school or colleges i have mixed views on	well i- i- i should imagine the lower grades what would what what's what's certainly drawn everyone's attention to that	0
agent:and uh uh European Middle Eastern and and Far Eastern yeah i- i think um [noise] i think|user:yeah|agent:yeah especially in those areas it's um [noise] i kn[ow]- it's it's almost fifty per cent foreign like forty eight percent and that involves both Canadian	wow	1
agent:yeah an[d]- and they can't|user:really|user:yeah	oh so you're close to the subject	1
agent:you know give or take eighty ninety percent|user:really|user:yes	yeah	1
agent:yeah|agent:um-hum|agent:yep	and i guess you got to take them away from the tube also another thing that i have another	1
user:right|agent:while Ewing was playing at Georgetown basketball Georgetown|user:yeah	right right right	1
agent:right right but see the sports brings in the money|user:yeah i know but i mean they don't just send it to the new stadium or|agent:because no bec[ause]- normally it's because of the sports	really i	0
user:yeah|user:no|agent:yeah but but uh smaller schools aren't like that uh only only the big time schools show that but you're right i- i think the emphasis on sports and as a see i'm a i'm a i'm a former athlete in a sense i swam um but swimming never gets much glory so it really doesn't matter but	yeah	0
agent:and but he's was trying to make it in the sprinter's event and most of them are under twenty five|user:right|user:right	right	0
user:yeah|agent:before i would continue the agony|agent:i think uh in in some sense um what i would do before i would extend a school year is i would make it better	yeah	0
user:it just it's a lot cleaner up there but um|user:um for my husband's schooling an[d]- graduate schooling and|user:and i don't know then we went we lived in uh Madison Wisconsin for five years	it's a lot colder too so	1
agent:oh sure i i'm uh i'm very familiar my grandparents and all my relatives are from Wisconsin|user:well there you could talk about that that's that's a strange state for|agent:Colorado	oh there you go okay	1
user:um so i don't know what's happening if it's you know we are|agent:right|agent:um-hum	the greenhouse i[s]- i don't really [laughter-know]	1
user:regime in which uh bottles and newspapers are|user:has just uh put in a city wide recycling uh|user:well as a matter of fact uh it's it's funny that i chose this subject because uh uh the city of Raleigh about six weeks ago	recycled and a truck comes around uh	0
user:so they've made it uh they've made it convenient it used to be if you wanted to recycle you had to drive to a|agent:wow|user:place to put stuff	uh a central location in the city and then do all the separation yourself	0
user:but uh it it it sounds let's see you you may you said one thing that uh uh|user:yeah|agent:to grocery stores and dropped off [noise] but	you know just for the the sake of argument here	0
agent:buy all unrec[yclable]- all recyclable stuff and everything would get recycled and we wouldn't have any problem but uh|agent:in the ideal society everyone would uh|agent:you know	[noise] right	1
agent:huh|user:and have the various bins for the re[cyclable]- various colored glasses and a bin for the plastic and a place for the newspaper and they're kind of these high|user:trucks that come around and have	sort of uh high tech uh	0
agent:yeah|user:the glass and the newspaper my understanding is that they don't meet expenses with it but that they offset a lot of expenses|user:that that that they they sell the	one of the problems with newsprint especially is that virgin newsprint	0
agent:uh-huh|user:really assigned costs appropriately for example the real cost of a barrel of oil if you take into account pollution and all of the other side effects|user:and that's really where we as a capitalist society have gone have gone awry we have not	is probably a hundred dollars a barrel	0
agent:hum|user:so that the people who use the newsprint are ultimately paying for the entire product not only for its production but for its disposal|agent:uh-huh	hey i bet you didn't think you were going to get a lecture on	0
user:uh-huh|agent:providing that plan|agent:are very successful with the operation of the government uh	do they have options on who they	1
agent:with your doctor that you can feel free to discuss|user:uh-huh|agent:primary is if you have a good relationship	uh-huh	1
user:and that that something like that you know i thought|agent:yes and the expense of that yes|user:and they finally determined what the problem was it took that long	if you couldn't change or	1
agent:but those guidelines have to be set up and i think they should be voted on by the public|agent:yes um|user:thoughts you know because you know how government is [laughter]	uh-huh	0
agent:uh included in all of that uh dental|agent:the eyes and the ears and the uh whole self should be uh|agent:other than the fact i think um	uh-huh	1
user:if they take the doctor that the|user:and that costs them less|agent:uh-huh	that the company has selected	1
agent:uh-huh|user:you know to make the choice of what kind of insurance policy they|user:known anybody that you know works for somebody that they had that option	what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take	1
agent:are you a native Pennsylvanian|user:and uh|user:uh we have a cousin that lives in Philadelphia	yes uh-huh	1
agent:um just phenomenal they|agent:that is the fields that you know are opening up are|user:oh yeah	uh-huh	1
user:so uh it real|agent:that's true too it's i i i really believe our environment have a lot to do with it|user:but a maj[ority]- a lot of them don't do these things even and it doesn't seem to matter	uh-huh	0
agent:do you do a lot of camping|agent:uh-huh|user:well not necessarily in Dallas but it's a very short drive to areas near here	well i have done camping in the past uh	1
agent:we didn't even use tents then we just had uh sleeping bags|user:uh-huh|agent:and we had a ball just sat out there with our	uh-huh	1
user:Arkansas|user:and uh|agent:uh-huh	i can't remember the name it's it's on the Oklahoma Arkansas border	1
user:uh-huh|agent:think so well it's the water he's not scared of he'll go out into it until it's up to his nose|agent:he	uh-huh	1
agent:i don't know but we just didn't get out my mother and my father split up when we were young so and my mother wasn't into that and that's who i stayed with|agent:my mother-in-law and my well they've always done a lot of camping i grew up in Louisville Kentucky and there wasn't|user:[laughter]	uh-huh	1
agent:okay so my children are twenty and twenty four and uh|agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	oh	1
user:and um|user:and i don't know how you did it but um i have a six year old that's well she's in first grade and then i have a three and a half year old|agent:right	i have always been a big advocate of spending tons of time with my kids	0

agent:in the public realm|user:yeah|agent:and and many of them_1 are computer based and they're based on information that's available	i'm i'm still not convinced that	1
agent:and you don't expect it from that source therefore you're not as uh|agent:those fax phone number lists are being sold in exactly the same way your street address numbers are sold and you now get solicitations brought over your fax|user:right	yeah but that's uh	1

user:because_1 there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts and then the other way around as well people are getting just pure technical science educations and not getting very good|user:trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together you know|user:the American Association for the Advancement of Science trying to sort of you know where where they were just	liberal arts sorts of issues so	1
user:yeah but tha[t's]- that's a good idea well where i am right now|agent:and yes that'll add one year to his education experience|user:hum	actually i'm at the University of Rochester	0

user:and that and that really is something that that|user:yes um-hum|agent:that and uh extra music classes	i notice like uh i talk to a lot of my friends at schools that are more specialized and they don't have that	1
user:take courses outs[ide]- it's completely outside my area and i'm finding that in graduate school it's a lot harder [laughter]|user:i've been trying actually in graduate school i've been trying to do the same thing|user:um i'm finishing up next year so yeah i d[idn't]- i didn't take any break or anything yet [noise]	because_1 uh i just don't have the time anymore to sort of sit in a course	0

agent:oh well see that that's the spirit of the sixties and whether we are talking about the rain forests i tell you you know the situation you have right now and and all of our generations is what to do with the children because both|user:my husband is not a conformist at all [laughter]|user:but uh	uh-huh	1

agent:they definitely do|user:well they need guidance and they do need parental guidance|user:make sure that	twenty four hours a day	1
agent:yeah|user:well i know the family is really going through changes but now we're trying to go back to about the sixties when the parents you know when the mother was staying at home|user:um-hum	or that what do they call it the nuclear family	0
agent:well see and and that is uh the sort of the thing of the nineties is women working out of their own home|agent:well that's|user:yeah i'd would work at home if i could	yeah that's the trend	1
user:oh my little boy just|agent:oh|user:and uh	he went wild	0

agent:yeah|user:well|agent:French reunion	not quite French but uh [laughter] it was sort of a reunion before leaving it was fun it was on um	1
agent:um-hum|user:yep|agent:meet in the middle	where [laughter-nobody] lives	1
agent:um-hum and then there is wild blackberries there too|user:well that sounds nice do people actually pick the fruit and things|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:where everybody fishes|agent:and uh because_1 that's where the ponds are and|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:oh it is probably in there just burping goldfish|user:so we do not know if it is living or|agent:oh	yep [laughter]	0
agent:yeah they live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota and up into Canada|user:but catfish do i think|agent:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:um-hum|user:so it was really funny and you could see that you know you could see where the trap the trap was dragged and things like that|agent:[laughter-right]	and so	1
agent:you can see their whiskers come through the water and|agent:[noise] but they come up to the top and it is the best time to take pictures because they come up to the top and|user:that's funny	um-hum	1
agent:that is only about three and a half feet long|agent:that|user:do you know	that's pretty big though	0
agent:[noise]	[noise]	1
agent:yeah and in full faction yeah|agent:um-hum|user:yeah the only difference was that the government said okay if we're going to support this smaller country then we're going to support it a hundred percent and we're going to consider ourselves against in war against these people as well	which uh	0
agent:you know and i don't know if it's because_1 there aren't any oil fields there [laughter]|user:um-hum|agent:um in South Vietnam in general in helping them restore themselves	yeah i don't know if they uh i don't know if they have that resource or not	1
agent:uh-huh|user:yeah personal level and and the finances how they started you know like air attacks and stuff like that dropped off like crazy because_1|agent:yeah the bitterness is more on a personal level than on a	the Congress wouldn't approve you know	1
agent:oh i know where that is that's beautiful where you're at|user:no i'm in Falls Church Virginia|agent:ah yes is that where you're at	yeah r[ight]- right near DC [noise]	0
user:uh|user:of our uh people are voting|user:and foremost uh where we compare w[e]- that we are now doing fifty percent	we're probably making a comparison against uh some European and uh	0
agent:um-hum|user:uh that's almost a fourteen percent turnover every you know if you compound that|agent:um-hum	that uh if it is difficult to register to vote that would remove your eligibility to vote	1
user:th[an]- uh than than a positive factor and y[ou]- and you know to if you if you go on the attack|user:no the public would rather hear something negative about the other guy|agent:um gullibility	and and put some sensational thing before the public as Mike Dukakis learned in the last campaign	1
user:oh he he he gave it that he he did he did he promised the best he could and he's the president and he should|agent:well then why did he say that during his campaign then he sh[ould]- it was totally [vocalized-noise]|agent:[noise]	he should address those problems and if there needs to be a change in a period of time why	0
user:but then but you know everything is relative to when uh|agent:hum|user:and the corruption of politics in in in that situation	[vocalized-noise] you know we had higher turnouts because at that time we [vocalized-noise] talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter right	0
agent:right right but you know that just made me think of something that happened down here in Dallas last year they have this huge fight going over redistricting here and at one point they did they took another vote on it|user:conversation we can only do our own reactions|agent:well	um-hum	1
agent:there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the if the wife is going to actually be a mother|agent:at all i mean|user:uh-huh	uh-huh uh-huh	1
agent:until it and um i'm sure until at least school age and maybe longer and what this does is|user:um-hum|agent:i don't i don't know	oh that's great	1
user:you know nobody seemed to have a big problem with [laughter-that]|agent:um-hum|user:and then yeah very soon he was old enough to just go and sort of stay in my office and	so	1
agent:yeah really|user:i'm sure that they're not making quote making money for the family on this|agent:um-hum	and and probably you're right	1
agent:it's beginning i think|agent:yeah well it's it's um|user:um-hum so that might be of a positive change in society	um-hum um-hum	1
user:and that people were going basically just as you said as a social|agent:um-hum|user:the very transient nature of the area	to meet people and that	1
user:well it's just it's maybe it's more unusual now when you know somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer and in the past maybe|user:probably|agent:well i guess that's always happened [noise] maybe not as much as now but	the same percentage got them_1 but we didn't know it or	1
agent:yes he did uh-huh|user:[noise] uh he's no longer with us he passed away when he was uh he was going on eighty nine years old so he had a good long life|agent:i- i see	but he always maintained his own apartment he lived in the city he lived in uh Rhode Isla[nd]- in fact we live in Rhode Island i work in in the Massachusetts plant but i live in Rhode Island	0
user:about a year and a half ago he uh|user:no and then uh|agent:sure he it didn't have any hindrances for him	he started having mini strokes	0
agent:um-hum|user:my wife tried to call him and he wouldn't answer the phone so we kind of expected the worse so i went down|user:um	and he had had another stroke and uh	0
agent:um-hum|agent:that's wonderful|user:and in in the course of the next [vocalized-noise] during the next year towards again it was getting on towards Thanksgiving time he started having you know more strokes and then uh	[noise] uh one morning he felt real dizzy so we took him to the hospital	1
user:[noise]|user:um i was working during the day and and uh|agent:sure i understand that	uh my wife couldn't	0
agent:right|user:because we couldn't take care of him|agent:um-hum	and we started looking around and they said no	0
agent:right|agent:um-hum|user:they're very clinical they're it's like a [vocalized-noise] well it's a business	you get them_1 in uh you do what you have to do for them_1 and that's it	1
user:which was a surprise to us you know we didn't realize that they had|agent:okay|user:regular staff but it was owned by Seventh Day Adventists	i guess	1
user:but i think only because|agent:i see uh-huh|user:they took real good care of him they uh he had lost a pair of slippers uh one day and one of them out of her own money bought a [vocalized-noise] pair of slippers for him and you know that type of thing	my wife spent so much time there	1
agent:um-hum|user:he shared his room he came in he could get around fairly well|user:[noise] let's see maybe about a week after my father-in-law was in there	uh he he again had a had a stroke and he was partially paralyzed	1
agent:um|agent:um-hum um-hum|user:well most people don't do that you know they don't uh they don't they fi[gure]- figure once you're in there you forget everything and that's that's really not the case and it's it's sad	um i hope that i never get into that situation where	0
agent:okay|user:um yes|agent:do you know some folks who have been there	a couple	1
agent:then uh another friend of mine went and he was in combat but he came back and he said okay that's it that is behind me i am going on with my life much like what Roger Staubach did|user:yeah|agent:to Vietnam one man and came back another not better	right	1
agent:since that conflict|user:um-hum|agent:well you know one of the most troublesome things that i have encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast Asians into this country	yeah	1
agent:i know that they're|user:well they are probably not doing very well at all|agent:and i'd be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now	because_1 i know there's there's still people even in the Dallas area	0
agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum|user:yeah Cambodia [noise] and to Laos	and	1
agent:um-hum um-hum|agent:that's right|user:yeah and all they can do is dig in and they you know and then they try to camouflage the top	well now even i think even now in in Vietnam they could probably have done a better job	0
agent:um-hum|user:i think that's one of the reasons that they've they've pretty much avoided getting involved in South America because|agent:and and you overcome those problems and you are prepared next time	look what happened when they were looking for Noriega and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him	0
agent:and i can't blame them_1 i don't know a solution|user:right|agent:yeah well you see that's what the veterans are so angry about now they say well we're going to listen to this and we're going to look at this find out what our mistakes were and we're not gonna make them_1 again but that doesn't undo the ones that were done and that's what makes the veterans angry	um-hum	1
agent:there there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world|user:right|agent:so and and and the Asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on	um-hum	1
EMPTY	[noise]	1
agent:okay|user:i let my kids watch things like Little House On The Prairie|agent:uh-huh	and the Cosby Show is uh is uh kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money	0

agent:and i'll let him watch the TV when i am wanting to get my house work done|agent:he's four years old and he just does not like to go out there by his self|user:[laughter-well]	uh-huh	1

user:uh-huh|agent:show i have seen where every time they sit down at the table they pray before they eat and i thought that was real neat|user:you know but	yeah	1
agent:a dot [laughter] but it is real cute and like i say they they|agent:and i think the dog is the only one that's not a|agent:but it's real cute well he's bouncing around and his name is Jot and then he has got a friend named Cat	[laughter]	1
user:it's what|agent:yeah i was just wondering how did this get on my list [laughter] how how did this subject get on my list oh well|user:do you know something about how to take care of [laughter-kids]	i i don't know i've got mine	1
user:who have kids you know uh|user:i wonder actually i wonder about costs because_1 most people i know who|user:and	one parent doesn't work a part of the time	0
agent:i don't know|agent:so i would say maybe you know a day or two a week to get out to go do something else not necessarily go back to work or something but|agent:and you don't have time for anything else so you	yeah i don't i don't you know i just yeah it it just strange because people do i mean in that sense it probably is pretty good to go out and just	0
user:so we pitched a tent in the dark yard actually and his father and|user:of you know like last night we we we the six year old decided he wanted to go camping in the back yard|agent:[laughter]	and the little boy and i all went out and had you know a a b[oy's]- a boys' night out	0
agent:oh what age|agent:oh|user:i do uh um i teach a karate class twice a week with with with kids	um they're four to seven actually there's one at i work mostly with four to seven and then eight to twelve i i'm i'm the class [vocalized-noise] so i	0
user:he does lots of you know he's he's he's fast moving with them they'll do this exercise they'll do that they'll do this they'll do that|user:wonderful with kids and he seems to know how to hold their attention you know he keeps them|user:uh i i do but i'm finding there's there's uh another person there who has goo[d]- he has got absolutely no training from what i know but he's just	he keeps them moving quick enough that you know	0
user:it it it it's mixed there are|agent:is that right|user:no it's it's boys and girls	uh there are um more boys than girls but there are a number of	0
agent:[noise]|user:[noise] well uh	it seems to me that uh that i don't know whether the jury system uh i i shouldn't say i don't know i don't feel very	0
user:i think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing simply because|user:um|agent:um-hum	uh	0
user:uh uh uh uh uh|user:uh without any specific recommendation for uh|user:i don't i don't know how it is in Virginia but in Florida now uh uh uh at eighteen years someone was just sentenced to eighteen years i heard on Today	uh waving the normal uh procedures and the eighteen years will uh translate into something like uh four point seven if every if the if the prisoner is a model prisoner	0
agent:th[ey]- they give the person the option for a jury|user:yeah well i guess we do|agent:you know any felony anyways	yeah i guess we always focus on criminal trials with with the jury but	0
agent:right uh i don't think i would either|user:no i i i don't think i'd change it the more i verbalize it i i don't think i'd want to change the system|user:so it seems uh	i don't know what we'd replace it with [laughter]	1
agent:right|agent:huh|user:they shouldn't be asked uh before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision i mean i don't	i imagine there's a certain certain right of the press to have	0
user:yeah i always balanced in the in the situation i remember the jurors uh|user:no but|agent:but it doesn't matter the guy was obviously guilty [laughter]	i thought to myself how did how did they only	0
agent:yeah|user:that will will be where it is uh if if she gets it planned i have been out of town so i do not know what she has been doing but uh|agent:so you are going to have to go there	they are all getting very very old	0
user:i still have elderly parents alive so|agent:it|agent:well	uh it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date you know that	1
agent:you know have got kids [laughter]|agent:yeah she has got a huge family and every one of them have five or six kids and most of them|user:oh i see	uh-huh	0

agent:so i guess it has been seven years since we have had one and since then we've lost|agent:well i have been married almost five|user:i hope	um-hum	1
user:[laughter-no] i hope|agent:uh i won't be adding any more to the family [laughter-reunion] [laughter]|user:that's uh	it i know it takes a lot of effort right with with that with two little ones like that	1
user:yeah and i- i think i think that is right uh|agent:and uh i am opposed to anything that would limit what the Constitution allows|agent:for you know for their whatever their own purposes are as long as they are legal purposes	the only thing i object to is like uh	0
agent:yeah well i- i always wondered you know why he was so adamant about you know about being opposed to that waiting period|user:it is interesting that he turned around for some reason|agent:right	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:that there is anybody that that does not have criminal intent that would have uh any reason to object to that waiting period that is|agent:and i you know i cannot see that uh|agent:uh you know af[ter]- even with the waiting period	um-hum	1
agent:uh or a least he wouldn't have had that gun he might've had another one|user:right|agent:uh at that time to have waited the seven days so if if there'd been a waiting period he wouldn't have had the gun	yeah he might have	1
agent:right|user:with what game species there are left well especially i mean using a rifle white tail deers mostly|user:and uh and the hunters you know the hunters uh	you know that is what people hunt for the most with a rifle	1
agent:but uh you know it was really surprising but it was good you know [laughter] from my point of view it was good to see him being able to defend him you know his his property and his store|user:um-hum|agent:and uh i think he got shot twice himself and uh but he was okay you know it was just he was injured but not seriously apparently	exactly	1
user:one of the things that he did is is um any counter top that was there|agent:right|user:because th[at]- it would breach the security of the rest of the ba[nks]- the banks	up to maybe like four feet high	0
agent:you know out into the public on public transportation|agent:i guess uh well i would have [vocalized-noise] even mixed emotions about him uh somebody carrying a gun|user:um-hum	right	1
user:Fort Worth i think|user:like the the judge what was it two or three months ago the judge in uh|user:yeah right	maybe it was Dallas	0

agent:drugs wasn't as now drugs was pretty bad but they weren't near as bad as they are now|agent:well no but back even when i was growing up it wasn't|user:of course it probably wasn't that good of an idea back then either it just uh	um-hum	1
user:they uh they're so outspoken on the topic that uh|agent:well|agent:[laughter]	[noise] it's an interesting change in attitudes	1
user:well i guess there's uh|user:yeah it keeps going up and up|agent:yeah they do it's what about_1 two dollars a pack now	it's i don't know of any other major changes other than the political environment course that things are	0
user:uh that whole defense issue is just not quite as important to people's lives|user:so now that Russia's gone as a major focused on enemy|user:uh it's kind of an interesting uh interesting problem not having any one enemy to focus on as a society tends to uh let that go out of the mind you're no longer concerned with the the weapon systems and the the defense area	so that's an	0
agent:i don't do any plotting though i don't do any you know i don't do any uh device creations or anything like that|user:oh okay|agent:just all kinds of things	um-hum	1

agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum|user:well there'll certainly be a lot of commercial products on the market in the next five years	and there'll probably some be some very good systems available	0
agent:um-hum|user:word recognition or something resembling word recognition|user:uh so once we get the the basic	uh my interest is in extracting the understanding	0
user:well it's it's all of parallels techniques that|agent:that's wonderful|user:um-hum	teachers ordinarily use during the day they they're teaching a grade stool grade school student to	0
EMPTY	[noise]	1
agent:right|user:um what i don't know is where do we draw the line|user:that might be true um	uh do we say that	0
user:yes it does uh a lot of that has to do with|agent:yeah it's gets into a pretty sticky issues|agent:but gosh a[nd]- and who's going to decide which is how bad you know something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me and	the cultures that we grew up in and what's	0
user:is a|user:civil liberties of purs[uit]- life liberty and pursuit of happiness then taking that away|user:promised the	a	0
user:that|agent:um-hum|user:freely committed you know freedom of choice the[se]- these people had a choice of committing this crime	involves the taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life	0
agent:right|user:for food|user:rob a store	than	0
user:instead of|user:he deserves help|user:that to me is is a different set of circumstances where he	uh the loss of life	1
agent:for their actions|agent:right yeah what age that they're accountable|user:begins	you know i i have an eighteen year old and uh i[t]- well he's nineteen now	0
agent:uh recently but hopefully the job that i will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations|user:uh-huh|agent:i was working well actually i haven't worked for any large companies per se	uh-huh	1
agent:ah congratulations|user:great i had i had a granddaughter [laughter]|user:oh	[laughter]	1
user:but uh|user:you know they have to pay for their own insurance|agent:um-hum	uh	1
agent:so i was pretty shocked at that but the other thing that i'm really concerned about and most companies don't have some are starting to have is day care|user:oh yeah should be|agent:you know and it's two big cities that i think of as somewhat comparable	yes uh-huh	1
agent:life insurance and uh retirement plans but [laughter]|user:um-hum|agent:are probably the most important benefits i should suppose i should be concerned with	oh	0
user:right|agent:right and you you you don't feel like you're a half hour away if she something happened|user:you know with your child	yeah	1
agent:you know which many times at a large company it's almost impossible|agent:a[nd]- and|agent:yeah	um-hum um-hum	0
user:uh oh|agent:because they say they can't pay more than this and that and they're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that|user:is that right	uh-huh	1
agent:okay is uh that a sport you like to participate in [laughter]|agent:[noise]	no	0
user:but uh|agent:oh|user:and as and did some you know instructions at the country club for a while	golf tended to be s[o]- i am not really deeply involved in any following any of the sports	0
user:to stay|user:i said whoa i'm not going to i'm not going|user:and he thought he was spectacular	interested in him so	0
agent:[laughter]|user:well i myself really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf you hit a little ball you chase it|agent:for it i think those are pretty exciting	you go find it and then you hit it again and lose it again	1
user:but it is a good healthy wholesome lifestyle|agent:right|user:influencing young people i think that that is uh that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age you can't play football at fifty five	a[nd]- uh anything can be warped	0
agent:oh yeah no my husband's pretty tolerant so he's not too bad to watch [laughter]|agent:[laughter]|user:if they're not real good golfers sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long	um-hum	0
user:[laughter]|user:um-hum|agent:[laughter] did you have to listen to long stories about how on the seventeenth hole i hit it and went this way [laughter] those are it's hard for me to [laughter] act nice about that when he goes on and on [laughter]	well the one thing that is a is a drawback about it	0
user:so i am not an athlete|agent:[laughter]|user:and uh hu[ng]- hu[ng]- hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball	maybe golf is a forgiving sport i don't know	0
agent:yeah|user:yeah we're neighbors|user:oh okay	[laughter-okay]	1
agent:uh|agent:yeah|user:i do all the time i get a lot of good tips from him	i have his book too	0
agent:well what kind|agent:what|user:yes it's a disease that it's got and i don't know what happened to it uh and then it	it um	0
user:and i really hate to lose them_1 but um|agent:yeah|user:so i kind of think that maybe that uh happened to these large trees that i have	that's one of the hazards i guess of uh having a a yard	0
agent:in in terms of getting them down|user:oh|agent:uh [laughter] the wind the wind blew over uh	um-hum	1
agent:back by the garage that i filled in with and and it's filling in with with grass uh|agent:had had a pile of dirt from various things uh|agent:uh	um-hum	1
user:yeah well i was kind of same thing it's you know i was i was brought up in a small town and and women tended to just get married and take care of the house|agent:how about you|agent:astronauts and things like that who know who would wouldn't have been imagined in nineteen sixty eight or something	um but as as times changed	1
agent:yes|user:on a family to have a divorce in it|user:years ago it was a stigma	and whether it was warranted or not people just stayed together	0
user:uh|user:and you'll also see a lot more uh congressmen and senators|user:within the next ten or fifteen years you'll probably see a woman vice president or a woman president	women	1
user:uh i don't know if that's just my imagination or not but it seems to be that's uh|user:uh they have to work twice as hard it seems like to achieve the same levels that a male does|user:supervisors that are	the ones that are up there	1
user:is controlled by women now|user:and also they say that the bulk of the wealth|user:um	uh just through i guess uh uh	1
agent:yes|user:the old Yankees|user:um they're kind of uh	you know it it takes uh uh it takes a stick of dynamite to get them moving off center in a lot of cases	0
agent:uh you know it's going to get to a point i some men are going to wonder if they're falling behind [laughter]|user:uh-huh|agent:so uh	[laughter] [laughter] the	0
agent:they have a lot of drug dealers over on you know where Spring Valley is and Coit|agent:um|agent:[noise] it's been a lot worse this year	yes uh-huh	1
user:um|user:i guess it moves in different uh areas at different times|user:but um	the only problem that we have here are are you know just very minute sort of crime we have neighborhood crime watch programs and then the	0
agent:and apparently they already they already caught him or they're talking about somebody else they're talking about two million dollar bond for somebody|user:hm|agent:yeah this morning uh-huh	is that right	1
user:the guy was that over in|agent:oh i i think that was Redbird|user:and then there was a man in the um parking lot and he pulled out a gun that he had in his car and he shot the	oh oh that was Redbird	1
user:uh-huh|agent:they also they tear off the hood ornaments too and one of them costs thirty dollars|user:yeah surely	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:probably around the mall at least once every ten minutes at night especially|agent:that drives around	oh really	1
agent:small town but still you know|user:course as i say we're a small town yeah|agent:oh yeah	yeah at least they're there	1
agent:and there's it's it's kind of hard to beat TI|user:yeah i won't get a card if there's an annual fee|agent:the APR	right	1
user:uh i get uh applications for cards from|user:no|agent:uh as far as getting another card where you don't i mean you know	oh different places for various reasons uh i got an application from Home Depot for their card	0
agent:yeah and it just i don't i don't really go for them_1 and i in fact i had my own before we got married and ended up cutting them_1 up just for the fact that TI had lower rates|user:nobody bothers saving any money|agent:yeah it just bo[rrow]- worry about it tomorrow [laughter]	yeah	1
agent:when you are a good customer i don't think they report that as much as they should their delinquent customers|agent:i don't think as many companies|agent:but i think um i think what you can do as far as	right uh-huh	1
user:i've got so many uh well i don't have a lot of cards but i've got a lot that i never used|agent:you know|agent:oh oh well i was wondering how that that worked because it's like you know we'll pay you for and i'm going wait a minute	uh i stick basically with uh the Texan's MasterCard	1
agent:i think|user:public school systems uh|user:well it's been a long time since i been in uh involved with	my youngest girl has graduated and she graduated in eighty nine so	1
user:oh that's [vocalized-noise]|user:and i think the school i thin[k]-|agent:[noise] but i mean you have kids you have kids going to school with guns knives that's that's from the home	well	1
user:the many issues that are facing the public school system|user:and have a plan that is going to resolve|user:um there's somebody that needs to rise up	and i wouldn't know where to start since i haven't been involved in	1
agent:yeah|user:and then if the children are influenced i guess they're influenced by their peers|user:and i believe that uh that starts in the home	and uh monkey see monkey do a lot of times	0
agent:it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn you know that that they need to learn at the age you know|agent:that age of course everything you do they're trying to learn to do and so uh|agent:and uh	yeah	1
user:yeah so it's uh we have uh lived several places around the the US and we have where we've lived we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area|user:yeah|agent:right uh-huh	like when we lived in Tennessee we	0
agent:read the things in the history books and understand what they said when it was like we need food we need to raise food quickly because_1 thi[s]- this place gets very cold very [laughter-soon]|user:yes|agent:really made the whole thing more uh visual and you could uh	yeah [laughter] [noise] [laughter-yeah]	1
user:i was very proud when my son wrote that|user:they had to write uh a little brief autobiography of themselves and about what they had done and what they wanted to do and|user:well i can remember one of the things i'm most proud of is uh when my son was i think it was in the sixth grade	he wanted to uh have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him	0
user:looked like it could be uh make a real contribution|user:this is a very interesting program i i've heard about here on this and when i signed up for it it uh|user:we've uh	in in participating	0
user:[noise] um|agent:[noise]	i guess my music taste musical tastes uh run pretty much the gambit i listen to a little bit of everything	1
agent:it used to have like the top twenty top forty all the time you know|user:right|agent:and uh it's funny because_1 KVIL back when i was a teenager was an AM station i think yeah and uh	right	1
user:but uh|user:right yeah|agent:yeah see i liked Elvis a lot and he was like my hero and now my little girl thinks it's real funny	but uh	1
agent:we couldn't get along because_1 his rock was too rock for me i like soft rock but i don't like some of the heavy metal stuff he was listening to|agent:and so uh we never could agree on what we were going to listen to after we got married because_1 i'd want to l[isten]- hear country and he'd want to hear rock and|user:yeah	[laughter]	1
agent:Grammy it's the Grammy awards they give for music yeah he won a Grammy for inspirational song of the year last year|user:right let's see the the Grammy yeah|agent:what does it	uh-huh	0
user:yeah|user:right yeah|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:right that yeah that|agent:yeah [laughter] that's right we buy things that we know the whole family can listen to|user:yeah that's yeah so in[stead]- so instead you buy Sandy Patty and Amy Grant and	uh i was trying to think there's some [vocalized-noise] uh we go to the First Baptist Church over here in Richardson	0
user:yeah|user:right|user:um-hum	right	1
user:[noise]|agent:um|agent:well that's not the right way to say it	you mean instead of people or	1
agent:the package would do that for them|agent:had set it up correctly|agent:they have to go back and redo it all manually whereas if they had learned the package properly to start with and	um-hum	1
user:very|user:how does the word wrap work on that do you end up with|agent:and save them a lot of time but a lot of people don't spend the time to learn the package	different length lines	1
user:oh|agent:right and most computers do that most pa[ckages]- most software packages will do that for you|user:they space it out in in the line itself	they	1
agent:um-hum exactly|user:especially when you have to trouble shoot some things|agent:well i think so	-[bec]ause a lot of the times the computer [noise] the program still has	0
agent:bye-bye|agent:[laughter] okay|user:oh okay we[ll]- well it was nice talking to you thank you	bye-bye	0
agent:yeah [laughter] [laughter]|user:and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns they start showing some of their newer stuff|agent:yeah	[laughter] so i thought that was really interesting the way that they did that	0
agent:well yeah and you know they especially boys i mean they're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff and i don't think that they really realize that|user:and i thought gee whiz if a little kid was watching this you know that would be pretty violent even uh for a small child|user:and i thought oh how violent you know to kill the rabbit [laughter] so he ended up killing the rabbit in the end [laughter] uh but then of course the the rabbit comes back to life and says well see this is how an opera is supposed to be	um-hum	1
agent:[noise] we're we're in Dallas uh-huh|user:i used to watch uh Dallas i don't i don't know where you're at|user:[noise] yes yes yeah that's true that's a good show	Dallas yeah yeah i used to watch Dallas ye[ars]- years ago [laughter] and somewhere in the middle i got uh bored and uh so i in fact i didn't even watch the finale	0
user:stay um-hum um-hum|user:that's true|agent:where i don't know i never watched Knots Landing but i think they've had a lot of their characters stay around	yeah in if you notice and if you notice on Dallas they lost all the women	1
agent:where you can lock up the channel or whatever|user:[noise] they have that little parental uh uh key yeah yeah um-hum [noise] so i- i have that at home|user:one nice thing though about the cable company we use they have uh	and i keep the keys with me	0
agent:i got a nineteen eighty three Cavalier station wagon|user:oh what'd you get|agent:yeah i just bought a car	uh-huh what what convinced you to get that one	1
user:about a year ago we picked up a second hand uh|user:and then we have um|user:Plymouth Voyager Van	uh Audi	0
agent:um-hum|agent:[noise]|user:and uh so uh i we're not going to be in the market for in the near future for any new car	but	0
agent:um-hum oh yeah it it has a stereo and a cassette player|user:i guess down there air conditioning's a must isn't it|user:yeah	uh-huh	1
user:but uh|user:and that's a to me is a real drawback i wish i would you know i could settle for twenty eight or|agent:um-hum	the um the frills on that car are nice but they're not necessary for me	1
user:so i guess if we get a new car it definitely would have to have an[tilock]-|user:so uh|agent:that's right	antilock brakes i'd love to get uh an air bag	1
agent:um-hum|user:that you use uh the Audi's German and i have to say it has been pretty dependable|user:uh	yeah sometime[s]- one advantage of an American made car is if you get stuck anywhere most local garages can fix you up	1
agent:um-hum|agent:[noise]|user:oh we've had eleven days in a row over ninety	they've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that	1
agent:yeah my husband was complaining the other day because_1 he says every time i turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling like yesterday i was telling him you have to you're supposed to squish the plastic [laughter-jugs] [laughter-before] you take them_1 up there|agent:yeah|user:[noise] and a lot of people complain because_1 it's really not convenient for them	you're supposed to what	1
agent:do you um have any ideas on anything that would make|agent:yeah worth bothering to go in and do|agent:yeah it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth	you know they they charge you you know it's like a flat rate i think for picking up your garbage	0
agent:yeah my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags [noise] like you buy your garbage bag from the city and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag but then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything so however many bags of|agent:right|user:to to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then i don't have to pay for them_1 hauling it off	[noise] uh-huh	1
agent:a lot of that's that recyclable steel and i don't know anybody that takes that|agent:uh more of the cans you know like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable i don't|agent:but i wish that uh	yeah that's true	0
user:there you go|agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	[noise]	1
user:is um|user:because um you just end up throwing it away most of the time probably eighty percent of the the junk mail that you get is|user:junk mail and	something that you don't need	1
agent:don't bother me after that|user:uh|agent:say no thank you very politely and i hang up and	yeah	1
agent:pushing something down their throat that uh i don't think is a good item anyway|agent:and i'm not|user:no	uh-huh	1
agent:invasion of privacy is trying to get personal information|agent:seriously my classification of of|agent:no i think my	um-hum	1
agent:well see there's no way of knowing|user:you can't you know and and it's sometimes it's hard to screen out all the calls that you don't want|agent:that's it	um-hum	1
agent:if i have to give them so much to answer the questions to get fifty rolls of film or something like that they're taking something away from me and i don't like that|agent:no thank you i don't need it and they say well don't you want to know what's free and i say no [laughter]|agent:my answer is	right	1

agent:uh-huh|user:i[t]- well it's a bingo hall for the benefit of the Indians there|user:it was a Indian	although i didn't see very many Indian people in there [laughter] there were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because it's it's	0
user:uh and highly motivated|user:and uh part of my reaction is that uh some people particularly those that are gifted and talented|agent:um-hum	uh ought to get on with their lives and uh and do the thing that they do best	1
agent:they had to endure or they had to go through they want a better life for their kids and they do put them in this wonderful little cocoon|agent:what is out there i know that a lot of young people are raised in a very protected environment mom and dad don't want them_1 exposed to the kinds of things that|agent:of	um	1
agent:um-hum|user:uh where are you going to go and and what's going to happen to you|agent:um-hum	and they persuaded me that uh i could serve my country better	0
user:trying to solicit funds for some environmental action or|user:i have a lot of people come around to the house uh uh|user:and uh everybody has there uh soapbox	preserve some form of wildlife	0

user:yeah yeah|agent:with uh hair sprays or those th[ose]- no i think it's now is what uh from what i understand it's air conditioning units and and we certainly turned into an air conditioned [laughter-society]|agent:so i'm quite concerned i don't think it's involved any longer with	um-hum	1

user:a uh it wasn't really gun control|user:i have lived in uh Illinois at one time and they they passed|user:yeah	but it was you had to register as a gun owner you didn't have to list your guns	0
agent:before you can buy any big ammunition|user:yeah|agent:they you know take your name and driver's license number hunter hunting license number and all that good stuff	yeah	1
agent:it would definitely be gun control|agent:you know|agent:[laughter] yeah but	yeah	0
agent:and i enjoyed my guns i have a good time with them so|user:yeah|agent:oh so mine are you know i use mine for recreation i don't	yeah	1
user:yeah|agent:you know we'd start with the BB gun deal you know so he started with the BB gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows and i took it away from him i said now|agent:you know like i told him you're a little bit young for a gun let me go out here and	[noise]	1
agent:you know i don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away so|user:right|agent:knows how to use one	oh [laughter] yeah	1
user:it's amazing the|user:oh okay uh [noise] a friend of mine was just called before and uh|agent:i am still here	that they have to go through about four hundred people to get a a jury [noise] for [noise] this one case	1
agent:yeah they are i think th[ey]- uh i think they need to stay that way|user:um aren't they supposed to be unanimous though now isn't that the way it is okay|agent:you know	yes i agree	0
user:yeah|agent:well i knot that he goes it it for the murder right|user:and then you watch this guy go to jail for um i should not be telling you because you are going to want to see it	and he goes to jail um	0
user:and um|user:yeah unbelievable|agent:good grief	yet it was it was almost a type of thing where he almost wasn't guilty because they had this little flaw	0
user:uh how they determined that he was um|agent:yeah|user:or the whole the Marion Berry thing you know the the governor	oh i do not know it was set up or something	0
agent:well you know they had uh a big drug trial in Roanoke Virginia|user:they couldn't watch TV they couldn't talk about it and this went on for like six months|agent:i'm sure	um-hum	1
agent:yeah you know it would be split one way or another and and that ends in a mistrial|agent:that|user:the it's not completely unanimous	oh so what happens nothing	1
agent:uh-hum|user:they showed a guy who um he's a lawyer|user:[vocalized-noise]	and what he's like known for now is getting men um	0
user:well i've had i used to have the opinion that there wa[s]- that there really wasn't any more crime in America in the cities anyway than there was in previous centuries|user:i've|user:i've uh	uh before uh simply because the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that	0
agent:it just really grabs your attention it just makes the whole place seem like that|user:uh there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they uh|user:regardless of the racial makeup but it's it's these real	yeah	1
user:well|agent:what do you what do you think is is causing all this because it seems that there there even though crime though though i think it is increasing in number it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity and violence too|user:i guess a a quite a bit of money and and other uh planning efforts went into that	yes well i uh i have three theories about it you know three things i have one theory	0
agent:yeah i- i haven't seen that but uh yeah|user:uh per capita i mean the Saturday night special stuff so|agent:hum	that that's what i think about it that's some of the things i think about it plus uh	0
user:uh i mean i i read now where where|agent:yeah|agent:yeah	you know women are arr[ested]- young women are arrested fighting with knives over over	0
user:well i mean i i guess so what i wanted to say and i stopped uh i do not know i got diverted was uh that|user:yes yes|agent:that people come down on you it's like you know hey everybody has to be free to do their own thing and i disagree and i think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime	uh there's so mu[ch]- there's so much of a return from pris[on]- to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure	0
user:yes that's right th[at]- yeah|agent:well nobody feels responsibility to do something it's like oh boy i wish they would stop doing that [laughter-yeah]|user:any sort of	i i do not know how that's i do not think it's done by uh	0
user:and uh uh short business stints and it seems to me they are a pretty|user:well Texas has uh Texas has uh has always struck me i mean i i i have lived in and out of Texas both in the service and|agent:start uh	pretty tough law and order state but [vocalized-noise] but yet that does not seem to have effected the	0
user:so uh|agent:wow|user:but um we need a large home cause there's twelve kids in my family	we have five bedrooms uh two kitchens two full kitchens	0
user:let me think|user:uh|agent:right	that's about all but it's all split level	1
agent:really|user:we have almost an acre|agent:uh-huh	yeah	0
agent:we'll try that last resort if uh if the painting does not help|user:oh yeah|agent:and if that doesn't work we uh our next door neighbor is a roofer and he said he would help me put in a skylight so	yeah well all our walls are white you know well they are plaster	0

agent:and making sure that the rain the rain gutters from you know the roof and all|agent:and uh keeping the vents open you know during when it's warm and summer and all that and i guess spring summer fall and i guess in the winter you close the vents and|agent:so uh as far as uh keeping the vents open and closed you know this is all new to us not having a house that had this before and	[laughter]	1
agent:uh-huh|user:but we had to learn to keep like a[ll]- all the bedrooms are two floors above it|user:uh	and we had to learn to keep all the	0
agent:and so we have decided to get somebody for one year of service to help control the weeds and get it green again and then i will take over from there|user:oh yeah|agent:and when we first got here you know there's it it i guess a long time ago it uh you know we were talking to our neighbors and they said the yard was one of the bett[er]- or the best yard in the neighborhood because [vocalized-noise] really kept it up and over the years uh just people were just renting it out and all that they a lot of weeds and all that have grown up	uh-huh	1

agent:um-hum|user:experiment for this company we had about three weeks ago it|user:you know we have ice cream [laughter] or something like that and that's why when i took did this	was just a total fiasco	1
user:yeah|agent:mostly i just cook for myself|user:do you cook for yourself or do you cook for others	well when i was single i used to uh i think my favorite meal was a	0
user:yeah that but you know um|user:yeah|agent:then you have to make a salad or	i i never really enjoyed cooking for myself so i ate very simply	0

user:right|agent:they haven't solved and i don't know if they can solve the problem that weightlessness has extended weightlessness has on the human body i mean we can do all we want as far as technology goes but if a human can't stand to be up there then what good does is it to have the station that for extended stays if you can't stand an extended stay|agent:um	right	1
user:[vocalized-noise] i think that they th[ought]- thought that they were going to get a lot more done quickly than they then they really did they didn't think out all of the|user:and you know they take [vocalized-noise] take some|user:uh	the variables that uh that might crop up and then they've been hit with a lot of those uh	0
agent:right|user:you know they they've had a man in s[pace]- in space for you know a quite a long time you know in in in in the different space stations that they've had and uh|user:they've uh	so that tha[t]- you know that's been good for them they've learned a lot and they've they've made some achievements in in that respect but they['ve]- they've been	0
user:the process of of creating space projects you know we you know we've seen that in terms of computers and and the the myriad of different uh|user:from the from|user:uh i uh i think there are definite benefits from	technological advances but	1
user:know big things like that happen i me[an]- i've you know i've i went through the entire and i grew up in that|agent:but|user:you know i i mean i would love to see you	early sixties you know big big boom of	0
agent:well they keep talking about uh the space station the biggest thing they want to do up there is is test out different manufacturing techniques uh in weightlessness but are these i- i never could quite figure out whether these techniques were something that could be done|user:i don't i don't know it's if it's worth it|user:be beneficial for us and uh	yeah	1
agent:i'm not eating in there [laughter] are you nuts|agent:was out of a outside or inside of a place that we drove up and i was like|agent:some of the some of the best food i have ever had	[laughter]	1

user:well like um|user:well|agent:like like name one [laughter] i'm not sure what you're talking about	well i can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between	0

agent:crimes against children is one of them|user:i think that|user:yeah	oh definitely any any crimes against person	0
agent:innocent people could do that but for every innocent person who would be executed hopefully there would be ten guilty|user:yes|agent:uh what is it lethal injection now	yeah	0

agent:uh the only other thing i have noticed though is that uh [noise] it seems that there's been a lot o[f]- or more empha[sis]- emphasis at least in what we've been dealing with and and uh looking you know just start not ev[en]- not really looking for a school for him but uh like a preschool or something you know where he'd go maybe a couple hours a couple days a week or something|user:um-hum|agent:well i- i agree with that and i seem i seem to feel the same way you know even just when i grew up and everything and and the way it is now your it's a lot of supervision is in is in hand and everything	um-hum	1

agent:and uh you know that's just a problem that who knows how that's gonna that's gonna come out or anything|user:right|agent:and uh it seems like it's a lot of the problem is to you know you always have the lack of funds but it seems to be getting worse and worse and so they don't have the resources to draw on to give as much supervision as as as kids need	but uh	1
agent:as i've gotten older i've started listening more to the words of music|user:country music|agent:well i could pick country music	i	1

user:and just|user:and um i feel|agent:um-hum	looking at it on the surface	1
user:and|user:that they feel that this is mo[st]- the most direct way|user:and in order to uh resolve it before it happens	painless way of uh	1
agent:and in in almost all of those cases it was you know husband and wife or boyfriend girlfriend or|user:um-hum|agent:well i've known people in the in the past that have you know that uh	um-hum	0

agent:and that i think is what is scary and i also feel that that's where some of the bad images um of nursing homes come from is when people have to put people in a nursing homes and they really can not afford the best|user:right right|agent:and and then of course there is always the problem of being able to able to afford either of those solutions	right and that's right i	0
agent:oh|user:he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or|user:they said the the woman the wife said	so you know and i [laughter-thought]	1

agent:and because of the cutbacks in the economy|agent:who has the other extreme she has a a child in Connecticut who is extremely gifted|agent:and it's been great and i and i thank God i'm here because i i know i have a sister	right	1
agent:right|agent:right|user:government money to fund the kinds of programs	that these students need and i'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem they test kids before they take them	0
agent:perhaps they are because they're they're|user:right|agent:are not as good	if you choose the select	1
agent:right well you see that with the foreigners that come here|user:the priority in the family is that child's education and is that child|agent:yeah	[noise]	0

agent:going very well because|agent:before it's really|user:absolutely yeah	um-hum	1
agent:um|agent:grad[ually]- they'll work towards solving those problems more too|agent:i think that they'll	well hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past	0
agent:yeah i would think that that's where it would come through|user:in science okay|agent:i think they teach it a lot in science	what grade level would that be would that be um	1
agent:you you know like McDonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing and|agent:well i- i know it's har[d]- it's a hard problem to solve because|user:thoughts are	um-hum	1
agent:[noise] it was a mistake [laughter]|user:um-hum|user:right	yeah	0
agent:that's right|agent:yeah|user:[noise] where i can pay for those you know you could m[ake]- make the transaction over the telephone or i fly Southwest a good little bit which means i can just run that card through the machine	uh and saves a lot of time and that's what i was using it for however we had a had a	0
user:um-hum|agent:and the only way to do it is go get you know an advance on a card and so like you were paying for it but it's one of those i'm glad it was there|user:um-hum	well i never did	1
agent:so|user:um-hum|agent:i've gone to some doctors that say you know i was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards and so many of them don't anymore	well i have not i- like i said that was just one period in my life where that was critical	0
agent:that's right|user:uh you send in uh uh fifty dollars you're going to pay twenty twenty five in interest charges|agent:that's right	you only get half of that paid for the principal so i'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts	0
user:um-hum|agent:i- i just i my husband is in business for himself i work for TI but he doesn't|agent:uh	um-hum	1
user:to interest|agent:i know you're like what am i working for today [laughter]|agent:[noise] i know and	yeah yeah and that just blows my mind i my house is paid for my car is paid for i've got some home improvements but even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards	1
agent:but you have to have a very good sense of saving and or common sense not not to get yourself in trouble|user:um-hum|agent:but i- i do like having them_1 there there is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis they are there to use	um-hum	1
agent:so i think that's what they did at first was that they had metric and and i mean and there's things that we've gone metric we have metric|user:you know what [noise] what i think they'd have to do would be to have both things on there for a while and then and then start phasing things out so|user:i mean businesses and things to use it so	yeah	1
agent:right|user:i think though if there was some you know sort of government incentive program or something|user:i think	people would begin to switch over you know and i think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed and	1
agent:right|user:that all now are are familiar with the metric system not like|user:you'd have you know two or three more generations	could use it comfortably right now but i could convert you know i could carry around a little conversion card or something and	0
user:centimeters|agent:centimeters and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were in|agent:when you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore uh you'd be [laughter] a hundred and seventy	yeah	0
agent:all that began back there and i think they're the only part of the continent that hasn't changed over to metric|user:oh|agent:our measurements started in England	yeah but i mean but but	0
agent:[laughter-really]|agent:a lot of stuff|user:let's see how many cups equal that	i- i have no idea i just uh	0
user:and we did[n't]- we didn't bother buying a scale and one of my friends was a physics one of these guys was a physics major and he said well|agent:right|user:X amount per pound or quarter pound or something	just remember a pint is a pound the world around and he got the measuring cup and just measured i think a cup or two cup whatever is a pint	1
agent:[laughter]|user:he wasn't aware of jelly bean physiology i guess and he got into a snowball fight|agent:um-hum	with the jelly beans nearby and he just and and [vocalized-noise] some snow fell into one of the cartons	0
user:do you train them_1|agent:um-hum i am afraid so|user:oh so get got got one with a lot of puppies still in it	did you train them_1	1
agent:but you know what it what surprises me my neighbor has um Dalmatians and they want to be in your lap just like little puppies do|user:boy these big dogs are something else|agent:um-hum	oh really	1
user:that's good|user:really|agent:to have company and uh the the young one that's a year old they do not even notice it when it thunders and lightning huh-uh it does not bother them a bit	do they p[lay]- get along real well with each other	1
user:uh-huh|agent:and the majority is they were two two large dogs and they're outdoors and the other three were in the house but you'd never know that she had dogs she must scrub the floors every day|agent:[noise] but it's amazing i have gone over there	really	0
user:wow|agent:um i believe the the standard are the size of a collie and the giant gets bigger than that if i am not mistaken|user:i mean like the size of a Collie big	oh	0
user:oh [laughter]|agent:it oh listen i raised three of them_1 i kept three until they were about four months old i just could not part with them and then you know i had to and i didn't think i would be able to sell them_1 when they were three months old but it was amazing i have a i have an enclosed patio and so that's where i kept the dogs and there's a doggie door they can go in and out into the backyard that's fenced so the mother trained the puppies yeah to to go in and out [vocalized-noise] and it's real interesting to watch how they they take care of one another and how she corrects them and|agent:[noise]	oh yeah	1
agent:she is not able to have puppies but|user:oh|agent:she had a medical problem and i had to have she had to have surgery so	yeah	1
agent:not getting to go uh just uh|user:is it choice or just business or|agent:i have	um-hum	1
agent:and uh a lot of those people have and and at time you know they all knew one another|user:um-hum|agent:uh from that {descendancy}	right right	1
agent:well yeah|user:just|user:is that just family's lack of priority anymore maybe yes that we get so involved in our work lives and	social lives and so forth that	1
agent:uh you know and and generally when i was growing up a lot of those people the only time i ever saw them was at the reunion so|agent:but uh as for the you know for the rest of that group no not really|user:right	right right	1
agent:yeah|user:and that that's been a that's been a nice way of|agent:right	keeping us all aware of each other i think	0
agent:oh i see|user:uh-huh that that's similar to what i'm in a PhD program right now and uh my|agent:well computer science and cognitive science so	area of expertise it's information systems which is a little bit less technical i think than uh	0
user:and stayed with it|user:i kn[ow]- i know very few people that uh started in one field|agent:yeah	you know they i think that's what you just said you know having to do more with the size of the school the environment of the school uh	0
user:i hate to talk to the parents because|user:i- i hate to uh|user:yeah [noise] i- i normally and and parents hate to hear this you know because i- i actually teach college	um [noise]	0
agent:oh i see|user:and um i actually i would full time at a at a public school and then right now i'm teaching part time at a private school at a Catholic institution|agent:<b_aside> could you get me those <e_aside>	and um [noise] and i really think i	0
user:right|user:um-hum|agent:like say you know the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something might have some top specialists in my area yet if i go to U of I or CMU or you know some you know any big name school my quality of education might not be that much better but it's the same thing as you know what will the name recognition get me kind of thing	right	0
user:and technical people know that but i don't yeah i think you're right you really have to think about that for the job i went to a very small state college when i got my bachelor's|agent:yeah|agent:yeah	and when i now i was in education at first when i was looking for jobs i was going to be a teacher i was just a high school teacher so	0
agent:yeah because_1 i've only bee[n]- made this is only my third call i-|user:yeah yes i talked with um i talked with people from Richardson and Plano and uh the first three days and then yesterday i talked with someone with from Pennsylvania so|agent:[noise]	it's the	1

user:yeah|user:i'll be darned|agent:for adults also and so i thought hey i'll just try this you know and see what it was like it was very um [noise] the style was very conversational	uh-huh	1
agent:yes|agent:oh yeah by Jane Austen yes|user:[noise] uh Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen that's what it was yes	and um you know i- i didn't know what to expect except i had heard that that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist and	0
agent:in the car sometimes and listen to it|user:right i wouldn't be surprised yeah|agent:and and now i- i mean i think it's around here somewhere i'm just going to have to put it	sure oh yeah	0
agent:well that's a neat thing to be involved in because_1 i think our i think my alma mater um|agent:yeah|agent:wow that's rough that's real rough	yeah it is	1
user:w[ell]- w[ell]- well|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:[noise] does your family normally have a reunion do you have one that's been	[laughter] on my father's side we've really there uh	0

user:you know about the bread and the|user:um|user:symbolic communion of the people gathering together and	ritual placement do you have a a certain way that everything's	0
agent:to our place down at Lake Tawakoni liked to kill me because i ha[d]- it was i didn't have that group cooperation i did it by myself|user:oh that's incredible|agent:and succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one	right	1
user:people who|agent:um-hum|user:six or seven years ago and the second reunion	maybe you know had	0
agent:no i was in Europe|agent:um-hum|user:oh really oh great did did you do that in uh Texas or somewhere else	oh whereabouts	1

user:um-hum|agent:we i wish i could but i- i don't really know how to go about it without having a degree or|agent:i have i have like	yeah	1
user:the|agent:yeah i think so|user:do you come by it naturally was your were your parents that musical yeah yeah that often is the case um	you know it's it sometimes it will skip like my husband is not musical at all but his mother is very musical and um and his children are very musical so [laughter] you never know where the talent is going to show up i guess sometimes so	0
agent:unwound a little bit from our daily routine|agent:yeah and just kind of relaxed and|user:ooh that would be nice	oh that would be enjoyable	0
agent:huh|user:and that's the best place that i've ever canoed it was really|agent:uh-huh	really pretty i was a little kid then and we	0
agent:it really pen[etrates]- penetrates in your memory you know what to do because you really have a great interest in it|user:that's true|agent:i think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older to learn new skills and i think they really	um-hum	1
agent:uh-huh|user:it it's really nice i would i would spend all my time in London or most of my time and that's|agent:has a great desire to do that because the love that she um has for it now after visiting it	it was really different being in a big city because i don't	1
agent:there's a lot out there to see i'll say|agent:that's wonderful|user:it was really interesting	yeah i know i [laughter] keep wanting to get up to i haven't i haven't been anywhere else outside the United States i haven't been to Mexico or Canada	1
agent:well you've been quite a few places [laughter-there]|user:uh th[e]- most the places we went we went to Germany and Switzerland and|user:and that was even nice because there wasn't	well i yeah we [noise] have [laughter-we] just kind of	1
agent:uh-huh|user:elicited their aid for a while and [laughter-they] were|agent:they kind of guided you	very helpful so	1
agent:[laughter]|user:[laughter]|user:that's	that and sleeping late [laughter]	1
user:um|user:[laughter]|agent:okay	you say you watch evenings mostly	1
user:i just wonder if if uh they just want to go on to|agent:different things|agent:huh-uh i'm surprised that i was surprised at the ending of you know with all the funny things happening and	other projects and not be	0
user:uh Northern Exposure and and uh oh what's that one with Burt Reynolds|user:uh Monday night is real good with me you know Major Dad and and uh|user:relaxation so i like things like Golden Girls or Cheers or	that type of show is what we	1
user:involved a tradition|user:uh they were uh it it|user:well you we watched it the times we've seen it it's been like on Satur[day]- or excuse me Friday night uh but it's we've only seen it a couple of times but it it's real the first one we saw um	of when a per[son]- person reaches seventy five	0
agent:oh he doesn't|agent:uh-huh|user:teenaged son throws himself in the way and says no you can't do it and then and then uh oh well we've got to do it it's tradition and the son was you know why and so in in the end he doesn't throw her over and of course the town thinks he's just terrible	because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and	1
agent:uh-huh|user:yeah it's it they they're trying to liken the the father in there of the teenage son to like Jackie Gleason Show|user:they	uh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:but i i and i'll watch snippets of baseball games and i i just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing|agent:um-hum	and i don't ever no matter what's on i don't ever just sit and watch TV i'm usually either	0
user:that|agent:well i just i thought it was sad that they it started out as a good program|agent:with the plastic	yeah	1
user:uh-huh|agent:the plastics and the and the aluminum and the glass and the paper|agent:because we we do the	right	1
agent:uh what kind of quality of life are you leaving them and and the and i have a real concern about that|user:yeah it's on down the line|user:yep	right	1
agent:dad used to do that and pretty soon they're they're figuring out that's|user:yeah|agent:th[en]- and then they say well hey you know mom used to do this and	that's right	1
agent:to most people and i and even to people in our country who scavenge for food and|user:yes|agent:mean what we throw away is is a ransom a king's ransom	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh|agent:it's it's uh	um i don't know it's	0
agent:Lynn do you do you want to start	certainly	1
agent:okay|user:uh not anymore they uh they've been in San Diego for the last few years and they're moving to Florida|agent:y[our]- your family doesn't live close then	and that's one of those things you just have to go once a year	1
agent:and we we really love cruises we've gone on Carnival Cruise Lines|user:oh i've never been on a cruise|agent:but vacations we really enjoy i think we've been on three cruises	uh-huh	1
agent:a few places in this country we still have a lot to see though|agent:someplace entirely different we've been to|agent:i guess we just like to go someplace	where are you from originally	1
agent:yeah as i said we've done them three times we'd be going again this this year if circumstances hadn't changed we we'd probably go my husband would you know the minute i said the word he he he's chomping at the bit|agent:oh they they they really are we've|user:and i've never thought about a cruise it's so funny	uh-huh [noise]	1
agent:yeah|user:well th[ere]- there are exceptions made for special occasions like that|agent:so that will be hard to stay away from	but the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer so	0
agent:went to Panama last August our son-in-law is from Panama|user:oh that's interesting|agent:it really does i mean oh we went to Panama too	uh-huh	1
agent:[noise]	[noise]	0
agent:sure|user:each time i change jurisdictions or whatever|agent:uh-huh	so i- so i just haven't because i mean graduate school or whatever so i haven't kept track of it i did when i lived steadily in one community i always i voted	0
agent:uh-huh|user:because this one really didn't matter that much|agent:uh-huh	yeah it's probably true	1
agent:in the dark|user:yeah that's true|agent:but it makes a big difference when it's the difference in having a child run over	yeah	1
user:did they|agent:uh i haven't seen too much crime in my neighborhood although we have a good crime watch program but|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:we were having some pretty healthy|user:yeah you you were getting slandered i think|agent:well course now that's not all the time we've had some pretty	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:so you see that's very negative motivation isn't it|user:yeah	yeah	1
user:uh-huh|agent:a little bit later when Nixon was running they went to vote against the less of lesser of the two evils in certain cases|agent:uh a politician as they did	yeah	1
agent:isn't that awful [laughter] how about you what do you have there|user:oh wow|agent:um for instance the local um sales tax is eight and a quarter percent	[laughter]	1
agent:um yes we do have tax on clothes|user:do you|agent:uh-huh	that's what i thought i know New York ha[s]- also has a sales tax on clothes	0
agent:can't do oh really|user:and see i take it she was an accountant|user:uh-huh	yeah	1
agent:and i there just i don't know i guess as you say you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what you are and|user:yeah|user:um-hum	uh-huh i think they should go back i- i realize you know that we have uh graduated tax brackets	0
user:uh-huh|agent:they were saying that the the whole system was going to be um bankrupt you know before very long because so much was going out for programs that were it wa[s]- that originally it was never intended to be used for or you know programs just weren't in existence|agent:that's right yeah yeah that's i haven't heard much um in recent years um about social security i mean for a while there not too long ago they were	right	1
user:[noise]|agent:yeah|user:in the last generation or two	well one thing and i don't know how how long a span a	0
user:[laughter]|agent:so i got really lucky there but it's real funny i have a niece and a nephew now and my nephew is seven years old and something was said about my niece being a doctor and he said well she can't be a doctor she can only be a nurse [laughter] i thought golly you're seven years old and you're already opinionated [laughter]|user:right	[laughter] well and probably probably he hasn't seen any female doctors	1
agent:oh really|user:and left that when i decided to get married and leave Texas for a while|agent:uh-huh	so and i've never gone back to it in the last in the intervening nineteen years it's just uh	0
user:well|agent:[laughter] yeah it was really neat but you know i- i hadn't even thought about about fairy tales that they really do leave that impression i'm sure with a lot of little girls|user:[laughter] very creative	i hadn't thought about it but but very likely i went to a seminar a conference just uh Friday afternoon	0
user:w[ere]- were from minorities but|user:the these gentlemen were all uh VP or higher|user:and	in addition they were also addressing um	1
user:and it was refreshing to hear|user:and and so forth|agent:yeah	that uh	1
agent:right oh yeah yeah i don't want here to be neglected of anything like that but|user:[laughter] she can pick whatever she wants to be and if she would like to be the traditional Cinderella and find that prince that's okay too|agent:hopefully it will all happen and by the time my little niece gets up there she can [laughter] yeah	but there	1
agent:uh-huh|user:and then after that we always put away some money for savings no matter how much it is uh you know how little or or whatever you know and uh and then after that then we have then our our you know spending money or whatever for for miscellaneous things but one thing that we've used and it's it's it's kind of good because i[t]- g[ives]- it gives you|agent:uh-huh	uh kind of a savings plan sort of	0
agent:that's a good idea|user:you know that page on the ledger and say okay you know we have whatever saved like a hundred and twenty dollars saved for clothes so we can go spend you know whatever howe[ver]- you know [vocalized-noise] up to a hundred twenty dollars|user:and uh so that then when we want to spend money on clothes or have the car you know serviced or something like that then we just go to that	y[eah]- yeah and that's how we kind of keep track of things so that when the car [vocalized-noise] you know when the car breaks down or something you you have some money at least you know earmarked for that	1
agent:yeah|user:just try not to spend a whole lot you know with some things of course you have to you know|user:just try to uh	and uh we try to you know make sure where we go and uh	0
agent:go ahead and stock up again|agent:then when the sale comes around again|user:uh-huh	well that's a good idea yeah	1
agent:uh-huh|user:and one of the things i really learned a lot was uh there's a number of programs for the computers for if you happen to have a personal computer or whatever that a lot of programs that'll help you you know budget your money and uh|user:and that's and uh one of my i recently got a master's in computer sys[tems]- science or computer systems	and uh it's kind of really neat because it does a lot of things for you as far as [vocalized-noise] give you all your graphs and your charts and stuff and show you where you're spending money	0
user:well|user:well that sounds that sounds pretty good|agent:those are just little things you can do	you have anything else to say or any other	1
agent:like i cut everybody's hair myself|user:uh-huh|agent:helps too	oh that's good	1
agent:uh-huh|user:that's a hard question to answer because i do physical things but i don't always set out for them to be exercise|user:well um	i walk with my parents	0
user:i mean i'll voluntarily clean the bathroom but i won't do it if i|agent:i see|agent:right	have to do it	1
agent:yeah|user:yeah we i'm sure i will do i'm doing that more and more than i used to i think i'm getting|agent:sure that all i i do all that	i'm getting better about this knowing that i need exercise and doing it but it's still at the task stage	0
user:uh-huh [laughter]|user:right|user:uh-huh	right that's i never got past that stage	1
agent:but|user:i felt real competitive there and i need to find some place i could go and not feel like|user:the gym because that's very stressful to me because i feel	there's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are	1
agent:yeah|user:so|agent:that's funny	it's i guess pretty	0
agent:and uh so i- i don't i don't think you should worry about not having a program yet|user:right|agent:think what can go and what to to to to replace this thing it's i mean not just exercise but anything it's very hard	that'll come	0
user:like a|user:i guess if i was having a dinner party i depending on the number of people i might cook a|agent:[noise]	brisket or a roast or a	0
agent:let's see what else did i [noise] serve with that|agent:and uh|agent:<b_aside> oh my goodness Diane get down from there <e_aside>	bread do you have bread to go with it	1
user:yeah right right so|agent:a necessity [laughter]|user:[noise] but a time consuming place to be	wha[t]-	1
agent:n[o]- no i don't very often usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them_1 plain so it yeah|user:we don't make it very often i guess but uh|user:we've	oh do they	0
agent:yeah if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing especially while you're waiting before you serve it|user:oh does that help|agent:it helps if you it helps if you leave the pit in it	[noise] okay well	1
user:yeah yeah|agent:i don't know there's supposed to be something more healthy about it [laughter] poultry instead of the beef and|agent:it costs less than the other and [noise]	less cho[lesterol]- less cholesterol	0
EMPTY	[noise] okay	0
user:[laughter-never] [laughter-get] [laughter-them_1] at both places|user:yeah yeah|agent:and we found that if it's in a certain part of Texas some people come and if it's elsewhere other people come we never get them at both of them it seems like so i think we need to find a new place [laughter] [noise]	right	0
user:oh [laughter]|agent:yeah well i guess um ours probably isn't that big our family is dwindling for one thing [noise] and i often feel funny because i'm in a branch that's all but died i just have one aunt and my family|agent:wow	oh	1
user:[noise]|agent:but then we have the same attitude when it's out there although this year we're going out they're going to have it at Fort Davis and we thought that would be|agent:all of that group to travel right	yeah	1
agent:and it's it's good for kids to know that they have other family|agent:yeah|user:the grandkids really enjoy it because it's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from Oklahoma	yeah	0
agent:not contribute|agent:[noise] yeah and it's not fair that everybody|user:some people do and some people don't [laughter]	[noise] excuse me	0
user:yeah|agent:kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school i mean|agent:we're teaching	is it the do you think it's the values	0
user:teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then|user:you know while we're not going to worry about uh|user:of things to the st[udents]- to the kids and	uh expect them to to pick it up at school and you're not going to do that you know you're going to carry	0
user:and uh part of it's the the family i think and part of it's uh|user:than uh we may have seen in the past uh|user:probably less respect than for for people than in in other things than	the living conditions of certain people are are subjected too uh	0
user:a lot of kids who are|user:where you got|user:schools like that that	basically uh	1
user:kids are going to a public|user:well you know in a lot of cases uh like that where you know if|agent:you have like you said you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured not to learn in instance	parochial school like that it's it's because_1 the parents are more interested in them receiving them	1
user:maybe the uh|user:um|user:then and then from the other aspect	the school itself is is has more emphasis on uh	0
user:uh|user:uh uh stress the importance of education to both both the parents and the students and|user:i guess uh to see about getting parents more involved [vocalized-noise] try to to come up with more ways to do that uh	more	1
user:you're not going to care about uh|user:you know if you don't care about property and people you know|user:uh i think that's a big part of it you know people	about learning i think	1
user:you kn[ow]-|user:the pits and uh|user:just	you don't have any	0
agent:uh-huh|user:right right|agent:not be caught shorthanded	i also keep uh	0
user:yeah i can do that because i can add across then for twelve months you know on my chart i can add it up at the end of the year and see what i|agent:make a forecast of what you think your expenses and then compare what the actual costs are|agent:do you kind of forecast yourself for the year or not	spent	1
user:our house is to an age that|user:uh|agent:those	that a big part	0
agent:the whole bit yes|agent:wet plaster walls and hardwood floors and|agent:oh yes solid foundations and	well maybe homes for have always been built	0
user:i guess so many people don't know that much about construction|user:hm|agent:i would've i would have a complete fit if i saw my new home being built like that	that they know w[hat]- these things to look for	1
agent:oh dear i hope we we don't don't get in trouble|agent:yes we did we we got caught we kind of|user:well i guess we've kind of gotten off the subject [laughter-haven't] [laughter-we] [laughter] we should have been talking about [laughter] home repairs [laughter] no	well if	1
agent:is that|user:as we can you know that's ho[w]- that's what we do with|user:well something like that we put on that line of credit and then we try to you know pay it off	[laughter-wi[th]-] with things we can't afford i guess you would [laughter-say]	1
agent:well i myself really feel like the structured day care program is more successful in today's environment|user:so um|agent:um-hum	uh-huh	1
agent:and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center and of course she was she had just gotten her degree and she was so enthusiastic and she was excited about it and she was going to accomplish all of these things|agent:i recently stopped by McDonald's and i was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children|user:if you're going to have the structure and you're going to have the large numbers you're going to need really	yes yes	1
agent:well i know that when my youngsters were small now my older son was adopted so he went into child care at two weeks [noise] and uh my younger son went into child care at six weeks|user:and that responsibility so uh it is it is a lot different|agent:um-hum	oh my goodness	1
agent:that's right once they get up in sch[ool]- um-hum|agent:i know|user:yeah well that's different than most people do it i mean a lot of people do it really the reverse	and go to work after the children are in school you know	0
agent:and uh so it didn't take me long to take them out of that place but that's the only bad experience i had the rest of the time they stayed in La Petite Academy|user:oh how awful|agent:so i just took off and went there one day and uh the children were left unattended in a room you know they they were not well cared for	yeah	1
agent:boy it didn't take me very long to hot foot it over to the school|user:oh dear|user:[noise] oh gosh	yes	1
user:of|agent:do you work for TI|user:yeah [laughter] that's the nicer way right	no	0
user:IBM PC compatible it's a three eighty six|user:actually a|user:[laughter] and the other is	guess it's twenty five	1
agent:is it programming related|user:but|user:um well it depends it's very different in the different places	[noise] yeah yeah	0
user:[vocalized-noise] well|agent:word processing|user:we use the PCs to do that and mostly i use it for writing papers and things like that	more uh do you know Latek	1
user:[vocalized-noise] and also as [laughter-a]|user:doing research looking at the speech signal and then doing writing|user:or um	just as a terminal and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that	1
agent:i think that's the thirty second warning|user:so that was it|user:[laughter]	oh i didn't hear it	1
user:yeah and|user:um|user:you know people can hear so it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up	often times that i can't talk on th[e]- can't do this much later than now between sort of like six five thirty and six thirty or something like that because the traffic outside they honk the horn so loud i can't even hear the phone conversation	1
agent:um i haven't done much word processing work with my job|user:uh-huh|agent:and i have a great deal of respect for it	[noise]	0
agent:um [noise] i wouldn't say compatible but there certainly comparable|user:flexible or allows you to do more or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days|user:uh-huh do you think you D Base is more	well i don['t]-	0
user:right|user:[laughter]|agent:come in to work and fix it if i can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone	fun	1
agent:uh-huh|user:oh really|agent:uh-huh they have the same kind of station down here and when i listen to music most of the time that's what i listen to	i don't know a lot of the um	1
agent:yeah i i played the baritone horn|user:i was yes|agent:Like so you're in the marching band and stuff in high school	oh okay	1
agent:um do you go to do you go to listen to much live music|user:uh-huh|agent:well i like it i i like the low instruments better too	pardon me	1
agent:yeah|user:oh i would love to go see that and Cats|agent:so he he's been to they've been to see it several times	Chorus Line	1
agent:yeah i don't know too much but my younger son listens to some of that kind of stuff|user:yeah i guess i don't know either you know|agent:yeah like depressed mode and	oh i don't know uh really weird names like The Dead Milkman or su[re]- i don't know	0
agent:she bought that the same night we bought the Nat King Cole and the Garth Brooks|user:uh-huh|agent:so these are a bunch of old recordings	oh yeah well those should be good albums	1
user:but we have i think all his records so far and|agent:uh-huh|user:the names of them off hand	all my brothers and sisters listen to them even the ones that like the heavy metal	0
agent:they don't like it then they should not be employed there [laughter] that was you know i would not mind it|agent:to drug test employees and|agent:an employer feels that he wants to	yeah i- i especially agree that if it's an area where they could	0
agent:well [vocalized-noise] unless an employer has a reason to believe that his|agent:uh-huh|user:i don't know sometimes i think they carry it a little bit too far	but	1
user:i- i wish they would and that i think is even|user:i wish they would|agent:i i [vocalized-noise] i think they should screen for alcohol in these areas too because i consider that a drug	probably more widely abused	0
agent:oh okay|user:now TI has the random testing policy|agent:could could mean life	and and you know our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a in a pool	0
agent:at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in|agent:i would i would rather have it that way to know that i was chosen|user:you were just the lucky or the unlucky one depending on how you look at it	oh absolutely	1
user:when they do that|agent:right|user:[noise] so it's i mean it it protects us in the long run hopefully	i- i was trying to remember there was a	0
agent:uh-huh uh-huh|user:amendment|user:to protest saying that it invaded their i guess first a[mendment]- the the search and seizure	and it's still tied up in the	1
agent:away from you but i i a firm|agent:and and then they say well if you give them the right to do this then they're going to take some other right|agent:right	i don't believe that	1
agent:you know it's one of those things that i want to see more than once [laughter] yes and uh|agent:in fact uh|user:yes very much	yeah yeah definitely	1
agent:[noise] down to her level it's songs about getting up and getting dressed and getting dressed on your own by yourself and|agent:and our little two year old granddaughter just loves it and it's real|user:huh	oh really	1
agent:i would too i just i'm not interested at all [laughter]|agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:no i wouldn't go see that if i had to i don't think i'd i'd have nightmares [laughter]	no there're have been a few um they're not really spy movies i guess they're suspenseful movies	1
agent:and i don't find too many [laughter]|agent:yeah exactly|agent:but i don't find many	yeah it's kind of difficult well like i said this weekend Disney had Singing in the Rain on	0
agent:yeah um i guess i missed that [laughter]|agent:oh really|user:yeah i taped uh Funny Girl was on a couple of weeks ago so i taped that one	yeah there's a lot of fun ones	0
agent:no i don't use a family budget my father who's very old has kept one his entire life and i probably re[belled]- rebelled against it and probably should have kept one he keeps every penny that comes in and goes out|user:okay um well do you uh keep a family budget or or do you have some|user:[noise]	uh-huh	1
agent:eleven percent on something that's what it was spent and|user:um|agent:a at least a record but my dad's was so precise that i mean if it said to spend	oh my yeah	1
agent:and a similar hotel in Paris is two hundred dollars a night now and i paid uh oh between four and five dollars|user:um|agent:i know well even in nineteen sixty three i found a a record that i had [vocalized-noise] had traveled in Europe a lot and i what i'd paid for hotels	oh	1
agent:oh yeah you have to do it when you're in school my wife's still in school getting her doctorate and so i it it|agent:um|agent:oh	and you know yeah when you	1
agent:yeah it's in Dallas it's here in the Quorum so i'm i'm Jerry Hammond and i'm out at Brookhaven College so you could just holler at me out there|user:um i uh that sounds interesting d[o]- is your business in Dallas then|agent:yeah	okay	1
agent:we enjoy there's an Italian restaurant over in Garland also called Taste of Italy|agent:and uh|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:which uh serves some excellent food too in that in that style of food|user:okay|agent:there's another Vietnamese type restaurant called Yoli's Y O L I S	so what would	1
agent:but uh i used to li[ve]- work over on just off of Stemmons and we'd go over there about once a week for barbecue for lunch|agent:[laughter] right|user:well that's fine for the summer but i don't think i'd be too interested in the winter [laughter]	uh-huh	1
agent:i think we have i certainly enjoyed talking with you|user:[laughter] well i guess we probably have talked about our five minutes worth|agent:[laughter]	[noise]	1
user:uh and so let me take the lead uh Angela|agent:okay|user:okay well yes i do in fact i am at work right now	uh i think	0
agent:[noise]|user:in his benefits like uh|agent:okay	perhaps uh he has uh	0
user:from any company that we worked for whether they be a conglomerate or just a small|user:we could not do without the benefit package from|user:it's it is uh	uh	0
user:to have uh|user:my oldest daughter is uh is uh a nurse and she just received her masters degree and she is now into consulting and that's one of the areas that she is working on|user:they are getting a handle on that in fact uh	uh a day care center for the	0
user:and they would not have the quality|agent:and it it would be just basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care center which is not right|user:it would be just futile	and they would be deprived of their mother	1
agent:i think tha[t]- i think it would be fair i think if if the company could not provide it all on their own for the for the people that would be using it you know a a a certain amount of their salary would go to it but it would still probably be cheaper|user:do you think that would be|user:from your salary that you are getting	acceptable	0
agent:i'm not sure i don't think we have that on our policy|agent:eye care is good i don't|user:let's see eye care	okay	1
user:uh-huh|user:yes|user:oh okay so	yes they are	1
agent:but with with the three children|agent:okay|user:so that's it that's okay my that phone is ringing to an empty desk and she's on vacation [laughter] so it's okay	uh-huh	1
agent:and it affects his speech a little bit not not anything you know|user:oh uh-huh|agent:squared not rounded	uh-huh major	0
user:on the patient in the long run|user:i i know but it's it's it's uh easier|agent:that sounds like it would hurt more	which amazed me	1
user:i i enjoy playing tennis so i like to have a tennis court there or|user:enjoy going places where|agent:yeah	or if it's at the beach the beach is great a pool is great and uh	1
user:and uh and then actually north north of that is another town and|agent:right|user:ride that goes up to the city of Silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining	a smaller on a smaller scale i guess than Silverton but uh and then there's lots and lots of real	1
agent:i don't know quite a few uh six or eight|agent:uh condominium which will sleep|agent:i think it's three bedroom or two bedroom	right	1
user:well we're uh|agent:so|user:oh well	the neighborhood that we live in they're switching to an alternate calendar this year so	0
agent:right|user:two month break|user:and uh in and in the summer would be more like a two month	so and they hope to boost the	1
agent:[noise]	[noise]	1
user:well what i find is that outside of uh|agent:so|agent:same thing i like if i catch old Twilight Zone and stuff i like those	well	0
user:an interesting combination of a a lot of luck and uh|user:which is uh|agent:uh-huh	the it's probably as good a program as any for the audience to play along and see if you think you're smart or smarter then	1
agent:and uh so i always end up missing it|agent:you know the kids bedtime is a little after it starts so i kind of lose track of time putting the kids to bed|agent:and i but i always you know i- i got to start getting into the habit of trying to record it on the VCR because i always forget	um-hum	1
user:i tend to go more to the educational channels|user:i uh|user:i may watch something just because it's on but	if there's uh	1
user:i'm a history buff so|user:i guess i'm into uh|user:that interest me they have a lot of series uh	with all their reruns of uh the aviators over the	1
agent:let me see what other [vocalized-noise] oh there's a new TV show out called Dinosaurs did you catch any of that|agent:but uh|agent:yeah [laughter] yeah that sure is plenty	uh i've read a little bit about it but uh	0
user:that they uh|agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum	it's i think the comparison is like baseball managers this year they seem to uh	0
agent:um-hum|user:very many episodes of it|user:watched	uh again it's	1
agent:um|agent:yeah|user:okay i am too [laughter]	um	1
agent:yeah|user:um underhanded uh things going on that the public are not aware of|user:that's correct and there's too much leniency there's too much uh	and it seems as though we are uh	0
user:oh|user:um|agent:well we have uh a situation again that i am familiar with where uh the son of an acquaintance of mine was killed while trying to stop a robbery	yes how sad	1
agent:right [noise]|user:and rise up against the injustices being done something is going to change|user:i have found that out that if enough people respond	people have to be involved	1
user:well i am too i mean i i just can't i you know|user:yeah|agent:yeah [noise] okay [laughter] i think we're both in agreement on this subject [laughter]	i served on a jury for a lady that was having	0
user:[laughter]|agent:well uh ho[w]- how do you uh view this whole subject are you uh one who feels like you've um have uh benefited from the change in in roles in women or or what do you think|user:[noise]	oh yeah i yeah i think so	0
user:so|agent:yes um yes in years past i know in fact even even the the word drafter is has uh changed because it used to be they were draftsman [laughter]|user:there's a lot of us in it	uh	1
agent:you know the one thing that i have seen is that more and more women are getting into management but i think they've got a long way to go [laughter]|agent:and i think that uh|user:uh-huh uh-huh	oh definitely definitely	1
user:um-hum|agent:she rea[lly]- would have succeeded in a lot of ways that men that women were not able to succeed [vocalized-noise] in her generation|user:[vocalized-noise]	um-hum um-hum exactly	1
user:um-hum|user:um-hum|agent:but you know now for instance there are there is uh the organization women uh the Society of Women Engineers so that is recognized as uh you know a place where women should be	uh-huh uh-huh	1
agent:because i know that there now there they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles|user:[noise] oh oh|agent:um the uh the role of women in combat roles during the war	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:no i agree but i am sure that there are women who would would relish that you know kind of an a job so|user:[laughter]|agent:no i wouldn't either [laughter]	oh yeah yeah	0
agent:yeah well that's great that's good|agent:right|agent:oh yeah	um-hum	0
user:[laughter]|user:yeah that's wonderful|user:um-hum	[laughter]	1
agent:but characteristically you know the women are trained or have been in the past trained in the home|user:[laughter]|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:women at one time did very heavy physical labor|agent:uh|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:but specifically the woman's role in society has changed and|user:yeah yeah|user:than they used to	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh|user:and uh you are right uh well that's how society has changed uh you know	uh	1
agent:well in the first place it's not your homework it's your children's homework|agent:um|agent:well i think	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh|user:no i will not you know you work it out for yourself	and she said	0
agent:yeah it will be a real treat for them you know to kind of come and do that because they live in East Texas so they will be something real out of the norm|user:it will be fun though|agent:uh as a matter of fact we were going to ask uh his one cousin to try to make plans to have her uh kids come maybe visit this way for a few days and of course you know things sometime you get to be the uh the tourist folks and we will take them to Six Flags take them to Wet N Wild i mean they may not be real quality [laughter-time] but	uh-huh	1
agent:but um and it's it's fairly clean there was only one little section of it that they probably edited for TV [noise] but uh we used to watch that a lot i mean that was just real kind of [flap/slap] stick kind of fun stuff we used to watch that with her kids|user:yes|agent:it's real silly	probably some of that went over their heads anyway	1
user:i i would say that his mother is probably like one of the perfect mothers she|user:and uh|agent:uh-huh	it's just one of those kind of deals that she spends a lot of time with him she listens to what he has to say	0
agent:uh-huh|user:but uh well you still get you know particularly if you are around a bunch of people with kids they still tend to look at you a little strangely if you do not have them but i am running into more and more people who have opted not to have kids|agent:yeah	so i do not feel quite so bad	1
agent:okay do you ha[ve]- but you have friends that have children that have been|user:yep they what one thing i|agent:with computers	i have some friends that have children uh not that many actually	0
user:strange i was uh a student for many years and then|user:no not at all in fact my situation is a little bit|user:huh-uh	graduated and went and worked in France for awhile	0
user:but at the same time i really it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now|agent:right|agent:right	and	1
agent:right|user:are they going to go there and if not the infant is going to lay in the crib all day and maybe have a mobile above it to play with|agent:that's right	and you know i play with her most of the time she's awake and i think that is so important	1
agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:whereas she'll be about eight or nine months old|agent:um	and so i think you know she'll be at a i have heard it's a roughage to put them	0
agent:where i couldn't get my hands on them i'm afraid i would probably [laughter-go] [laughter-crazy]|agent:[vocalized-noise] that's nice when uh i my i have three grandchildren another one coming in September and i it would if they were|agent:right right	uh-huh	1
user:to work on a part time basis i'm hoping i can leave|user:and so if i go back|user:freelance type work from home	my daughter with her	0
user:but i think the whole you know ideally i think the|user:and so we'll just have to see how things work out|agent:uh-huh	businesses should have	0
user:[noise]	okay	0
user:now my parents are|agent:uh-huh|user:say they never want to go to a nursing home you know where others say well you know put me there [laughter-if] [laughter-i] [laughter-get] [laughter-that] [laughter-bad] [laughter-you] [laughter-know]	seventy nine and eighty one	1
agent:uh-huh|user:the nursing home there if if they had to go there there would be some of their old friends there you know and it's and|user:and so	rather than in a city where you probably wouldn't know anyone so that would be to their	0
user:is failing bad you know i don't know if he has starting of Alzheimer or|user:but my stepfather's health is|user:and uh	or what but the last say three years since he had to have some kind of brain surgery	0
user:all that kind of stuff she just wasn't doing it you know|user:got to where she couldn't take care of herself anymore in Florida as far as you know eating meals and|user:here in the neighborhood too uh one's mother just	so she has come to live with her	0
agent:in the home of one of the children|agent:uh situation to be|agent:it is a much more pleasant more caring	uh-huh	1
user:get out that much anymore|user:they you know get to where they don't|user:too uh	maybe especially_1 if they hadn't always lived in that area they're moving from	1
agent:right|user:to make up the difference|user:are the children going to help out	you know if there's two parents that might be	1
agent:don't really have that time off yet so|user:oh|agent:yeah i am in the restaurant business i run restaurants and uh didn't really	yeah that would be difficult where did you see the boat	1
agent:oh that's true|user:we're forced to talk to each other and there's nothing to interrupt us and it's just so relaxing|user:well that's another th[ing]- good thing about our boat is going out on the weekends at least	so even if we do not ski but	0
user:a school of shad came bebopping across the water|user:but uh it was really neat last weekend we were sitting out in the in the boat and a a|agent:[laughter]	and he threw the line out and caught a fish on the first cast	0
agent:yeah|user:huh was it inboard outboard|agent:no it couldn't have been that old it's	you don't know how big the engine was	1
user:i think i'll keep it in the garage [laughter]|agent:something a hundred twenty a hundred twenty a hundred fifty a month oh i know it|user:whoa	[laughter] that's outrageous	1
user:really|agent:yeah [laughter] in it's truest sense right|user:yeah you know hang out the gone fishing sign [laughter]	i do not know a lot of people say boats are just a hole in the water that you pour money into but we've been real fortunate we have not had any problems	1
agent:oh oh we are supposed to talk|agent:what was the topic i forgot|agent:so uh let's see wh[at]-	advice for people taking for parents uh help their their kids through college	1
agent:but you know i know it's some people are real adamant about you know going to a certain school or whatever|user:uh-huh|agent:i feel like my education you know you get out of it what you put into it i think	uh-huh	1
agent:right|agent:uh-huh|user:i paid for my entire education so i had to look for something that i could afford economically	you know	0
agent:oh i see where are you going to move to|user:no no not yet i am moving shortly so i am not looking around here|agent:somewhere then or	uh Maryland	0
agent:so i think you know financially that's that's one of the big aspects|agent:and uh|agent:still was a challenge to do	exactly yeah	1
agent:yeah you are right exactly|user:yeah see well i screwed myself up also there was a point in time that i decided that i did not want to in school and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said what are you going to do and i said well i am going to go because i have not whipping butter the rest of my life you know|agent:all at the same time but	so i went and i just took business	0
agent:uh-huh|user:but uh i think a lot of kids that [vocalized-noise] hold off a year or two|user:and that's what i i knew that's what i wanted	oh my gosh i would like to see the results on a study done i think they would do a lot better because they're more focused	0
agent:uh it was always my mother's fault she was not uh sufficient you know she just was not good enough what was wrong with her was she not attractive enough did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest it was that kind of an attitude|user:oh mercy|agent:and they all felt that th[ere]- there was never an issue that my father was the was the cause of the reason for the split up even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce	yeah that	0
user:yeah|agent:yeah hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back you know|user:she had high standards	oh	0
user:well i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well uh Nickie|agent:uh in the church so basically that's that's well i am done talking do you want to talk [laughter]|user:surely	and i can uh relate to that uh	1
user:and uh i think that uh|agent:uh-huh|user:so that's the main point is that we are going ahead	in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition	1
user:and they know that they can uh|agent:uh-huh|user:the one's that uh go along with that they are sure of themselves	you know uh be on the same level	0
user:and i|user:uh|agent:uh-huh	what i would like to see happen	0
agent:it's just really interesting to me i am married to a wonderful man you know who treats me very|agent:and i do not know if that's i mean that's it's a militaristic point of view i guess you know somebody can not be colonel and everybody else is infantry but|agent:uh it just seems that it seems it seems that they are more comfortable that way	uh	1
user:before|user:and i think the issue should be settled|agent:um	there's a conflict	1
user:that would be a beautiful|user:uh|agent:uh-huh um-hum	relationship	0
agent:when they have teachers' holidays and that kind of stuff i will take my friends' kids that are usually in day care|user:uh-huh|agent:when i take care of some people's kids you know when they	uh-huh	1
user:and|agent:well how did you go about selecting a college then|user:no our last daughter she didn't want to go to school she's uh but she's married now they built a home just a couple miles from us	well	0
user:[noise] oh|user:and he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh he went to aeronautical uh|agent:uh-huh	just learning to work on engines and that	0
user:more expensive|user:uh she went there two years and it was|user:to Gannan University uh or Gannan College i'm not sure which it is college i guess	and she soon realized you know even though she didn't like Clarion she came back and finished at Clarion	1
user:uh yeah they kind of|user:uh-huh|agent:when they were like in junior high and high school i mean had they did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and	had that	0
agent:[laughter] yeah i was|user:like my kids they're all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state|agent:uh-huh	you know that boggles my mind	1
user:uh|agent:i am not going to say i resent it but i was well one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and you know one of the Rhodes Scholars kids and|agent:i kind of	uh-huh	1
agent:and put into someplace else where people thought differently looked differently sounded differently uh different life style|user:uh-huh uh-huh|user:uh-huh	[laughter]	0
agent:it's very different|user:it's quite a bit different|agent:an upper class suburb of Dallas let me tell you	see that's the way we are we're more of a rural	0
user:you know they're better off now our children all|user:if it's really what they want|user:and so in the long run	pretty much borrowed for their school	0
agent:yeah if it's a it's a it presents a clear and present danger i mean it|user:deputies he is out free walking the street i have a real problem|user:a[nd]- and especially when they're assaulting people and then killing people i mean the man that killed those three sheriffs	with that	1
agent:the [vocalized-noise]|user:right well they can't get any if the judge is going to|agent:more	have any award to the victim it just puts off their collecting it	1
agent:well that bothers me that that bothers me a great deal i had a friend who was a police officer who was killed in the line of duty|user:hm and and how do you feel about murders of law officers or fire people or something that are|agent:needs to be addressed in in in that context	because they have had them they have had them killed when they've	1
agent:so i i d[o]- i do feel strongly about|agent:and that's uh|user:the	i think this giving excuses is pretty	0
user:it's it's uh|agent:yeah|user:making bad choices deliberately or anything it's	i- i i sometimes think if if i were on a jury and and had to make the decision could i	0
agent:it i think it was like a free subscription|agent:yeah well it was a special thing|user:oh and so you can keep up with when you miss with that	um	1
agent:yeah they're i've i've bought it a couple of times that or one of the other ones like that one you know after reading the front page there will be something that just catches my eye and i'll go ahead and buy it|agent:i'd forgotten|agent:yeah	um-hum	1
user:i just kind of stick to these two now but|user:some of those but i|user:yeah i used to years ago read like Ladies Home Journal and McCall's and	uh you know because they come	0
user:about|user:usually|agent:yeah	movie stars or	0
user:i'll just buy the ones off the newsstand then|agent:yeah it is getting real expensive|user:uh subscribe for a year it was like seventy five dollars [laughter-and] [laughter-i'm] [laughter] this will probably be the [laughter-last] [laughter-time] [laughter]	once a month or something when there's something i'm especially interested in reading about you know	1
agent:more|user:uh-huh and and it's|agent:because mainly i i'm like you i read books	it's more	0
agent:putting|agent:and it was saying you know what to you know how you could go about|user:[laughter]	starting to save now	1
user:a pain in the neck about it up here|user:uh i've i've i've i've discovered i mean even in my case it's sort of they're really um|agent:yeah	because	0
user:and and and it turns out that actually uh|user:right i mean uh|agent:and and yeah and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars semester uh you you never use because you just use your wife's	the benefits they you know that that hundred dollars	0
agent:but not probably not at probably not a deciding factor but uh|agent:a a negative but uh|agent:yeah that's a that that is a	yeah	0
user:in some sense that that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes|user:a news special or something like that and they were saying how|user:yeah i think i was watching something the other day about that actually on uh	you know lowers the cost of everything and all insurance	0
agent:would go for it|agent:chauvinistic as far as women go uh oh it was it was entertaining but um yeah i don't think the general audience would|user:[laughter-oh] it wasn't that [laughter-good] hey [laughter]	oh	0
user:[laughter-yes] but this one it was fairly long i i'm guessing probably an hour and|agent:[laughter-oh] that always seems to happen when you rent them you know [laughter]|user:i know we we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever [laughter] [laughter]	forty five minutes maybe	0
agent:oh we don't get out as much as we'd like we have two children so we [laughter] occasionally get out to the movies but uh|agent:oh oh God yeah yeah and we usually have|user:most of them are a coin flip [laughter]	yeah	1
agent:uh-huh|user:yeah my wife took the uh i think the kids to see that one but|agent:and uh they enjoyed that but uh i missed that one my husband took the kids to see that one so	we can generally find something at the store for them to watch [laughter]	1
agent:i think that's the one i wanted to pick up the other day and then my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me so i thought i better save that one for another day [laughter]|agent:uh-huh|user:which uh my wife en[joy]- she likes the suspense movies i enjoyed it to a degree	[laughter-because] [laughter-it's] save that for another day	1
agent:thanks for punching in and uh i hope you see a good movie soon|user:okay bye|agent:well you too Jim	h[ave]-	0

agent:[laughter] you like Fords huh|user:a four year old uh Crown Victoria that i love|user:a seventy eight Chevy wagon and then a	and	0
user:that's a good choice for a child i think to start|user:well that's not|agent:two of them_1 decided on trucks pickup trucks [laughter]	to start to drive in	1
agent:i guess they call it a midsize car but|user:oh really|agent:earlier ones i've had yeah this is supposedly a	uh-huh	0
user:like when my husband and my sons and sons-in-law all have long legs they're tall people and|user:well i e[ven]- even in our car i know|user:[laughter]	so if one of like my husband's driving then he soot scoots his seat back	0
agent:[laughter]|user:and they'll show them sometimes on TV and they've all got these real low|agent:um-hum	sports cars	1
agent:yeah|user:one thing our d[oes]- our car doesn't have that|user:you know maybe to do that they had couldn't make them where they were just real stable	i'd look for in another car is that that little	1
user:is it is it uh a kind of a dirty rain you know i i've never been down in there but you always here how polluted|agent:yeah|user:had a lot	with all the oil	1
user:well i just|user:oh my|agent:just had a friend come back from Colombia	i- i don't know i you know i just hear that	0
user:is this|user:and they tease her|agent:um	you know to see her drive up [laughter-in] [laughter-front] [laughter-of] [laughter-the] [laughter-school] everybody wonders who it is	1
agent:you know allow you the privacy and all [laughter]|agent:oh that's oh that's true the old culottes that's right but those are just real comfortable and um|user:but those aren't that new i mean i have some that were way old [laughter] yeah [noise]	oh yeah	0
agent:[laughter]|user:yeah it's pretty comfortable i had never done that and i just i could not find any hose anywhere so|agent:[laughter] check on the length well we wear the knee high ones a lot too so [laughter]	the one day that i did it and i got caught	1
agent:yeah that's [laughter] that's really [laughter-true] [laughter-because] who would want it down here|user:yeah but you'd have to go back to Illinois to have a garage sale [laughter]|agent:but like i said i'm kind of a	[noise] really	0
agent:um|user:um i've been fortunate i've found them in in a catalog and then they're a lot cheaper than you can find them_1 at Dillard's|agent:where have you found them	so um	0
agent:[laughter-um-hum]|user:but it's just kind of frustrating because_1 on the weekends you want to go out to play and you don't have any play clothes|agent:yeah	so i need to kind of acclimate my wardrobe to a lot of skirts and shirts i think where then that way i could at least wear the shirts on the weekend	0
agent:old enough that they really care what they're wearing|agent:um is when the kids get|user:[noise]	oh yeah i can imagine	1
agent:i mean they are absolutely demolished there are pieces hanging off of them|user:[laughter]|agent:and they are demolished	[noise]	1
agent:of really good you know work leather nice men's dress shoes and they were about a hundred and fifty dollars or you know something like that and you know he said i felt terrible spending that amount of money|user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter-oh] it's just awful and my husband bought i mean this year he bought a pair of	uh-huh	1
agent:the only crime we really see is uh just the kids being malicious|agent:you know we have uh it it's really funny|agent:but	uh-huh	1
agent:close by and you know they experience a lot more|agent:Washington i think is uh|agent:yeah i think that's we're about the same in Baltimore though um	uh-huh	1
user:and just the situation that's developed with the|agent:yeah|user:was reasonably unknown	the drug	0
agent:yeah|user:you know in a sense i don't i'm n[ot]- i have real mixed feelings on that because|agent:uh District Attorney before and a prosecutor before becoming becoming mayor so that's a really stran[ger]- you know it's a different viewpoint i uh	it comes a bit from the angle that the uh	1
agent:um-hum|user:society didn't try to then save themselves from it they let this person|user:uh	who had ruined it	1
agent:you know it really couldn't be a good test because Alaska's so different than every other part of the country|agent:um|agent:but i- i never i never heard results or anything like that so i never you know plus that's such a that's not a true	uh-huh	1
user:but you know the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the uh in Europe they seem to have mentality and drunk driving is a good one is that|agent:[laughter-yeah]|user:uh for mental duress or whatever	people are	1
agent:and um|agent:i i i really uh my father was hit by a drunk driver when i was in high school|agent:uh and	uh-huh	1
agent:and uh my brother became involved with them over twenty years ago as a manager and then ended up being both manager and conductor for quite a number of years|agent:so it's the oldest organization really of it's type in the country|agent:started the band like seventy years ago i think	oh	0
user:my dad enjoyed opera and classical music and ballets and so um even as a child i got to go|user:um|user:for placing so he could really relate to what you were saying but	to a lot of different um	1
agent:uh-huh|user:son just started high school this year and has been in band since middle school but this was the first year|user:but um when you mentioned the band music my	with marching band and i really enjoy band music um	0
agent:right|user:composers other than the traditional Sousa and things that everybody knows and|user:band music and some of the wonderful	so i've	1
agent:so i figured that uh i could probably listen to a different album every day of the year for about seven years [laughter]|user:oh gosh|agent:classical record collection now	God	1
user:okay well|agent:okay	i uh	0
user:yeah|agent:from murder on up to like tax stuff you know|agent:not knowing you know exactly what things are [vocalized-noise] from	because_1 i find that uh	1
user:or the fair sentence and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is|user:uh|user:come up with the fair value	uh	0
agent:or not long enough or you know whatever the case may be|user:um-hum|agent:longer you know that didn't fit the punishment didn't fit the crime	yeah	1
user:uh and we don't have uh again a lot of knowledge so we don't know what is really going on what is|user:because we see the headlines|user:gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what's what	uh	1
user:juries|user:it's restricted in the sense that|user:uh the role of juries is is restricted and uh i'm not sure i'd want to change that aspect of it one is	only decide the charges	1
agent:yeah|user:usually don't get to hear all the information|user:that you	it's what information is presented and	1
agent:most of the criminal acts that are done are done by guns that are bought in a gun shop though i believe it's probably [noise] bought across the market and i don't think gun control is gonna have any control over that at all [noise]|agent:um i don't believe that|agent:i don't think it hurts for anybody to wait for a week or two before they get a gun if somebody goes in to buy one so that they can check that person out	so uh you're	0
user:England|agent:jeez now i don't know|user:well doesn't it doesn't doesn't London have a ban on firearms	yeah don't they carry don't their policemen over there carry these billy clubs	1
user:and i worry about it being stolen|user:and i carry one in the pickup uh|agent:uh-huh [laughter]	and uh of course i'm like you i don't like to kill things	1
agent:i don't either that's the problem|user:i don't think we ever will|agent:you think we could ever get to that point where there would be no firearms	yeah so	0
agent:right i could go for that|user:the handling of firearms|user:we could put some sort of restriction on	like like you suggested	1
agent:[vocalized-noise] i'm a s[ubstitute]- i'm a substitute teacher is is this Pat i'm talking to now yeah i'm a substitute teacher in i believe the same school system we both work in|user:teaching|user:all right and and your occupation is	substitute teacher	1
user:uh|user:but you don't know|agent:yes	i guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there	1
user:add a heavier jacket or|user:maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer and|user:basically i just you know i wear slacks year round except every about once a week i try to wear a skirt and and in the winter you know i just add a	you know wear jackets more in the winter than i do in the summer	1
agent:right it might be Thursday for the high schools and it may be Friday for the senior high schools|user:right on what Thursd[ay]- Thursday|agent:i guess football season maybe all year long they wear the school colors for uh game day which	right right so that would kind of give you	1
user:and and uh|user:uh you know they'll wear it with a nice top|agent:uh-huh	i don't know that that looks that bad	0
user:right that i didn't ever understand i mean we've got coaches that teach|agent:parachute pants [laughter]|user:[vocalized-noise] right and a T-shirt	health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period so [laughter]	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:it certainly makes it easier to dress|user:well some of them yes they do and and it's not at some of the private schools but even there's a couple public schools in Dallas where where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers you know dress	in accordance with that	1
agent:yeah|user:they may get a[way]- but they said in the Dallas schools that that|agent:no not	helps their educational process there	1
user:um|agent:uh-huh|user:uh the quality of food is usually kind of is affected by how the mood is set so	i guess my favorite kind of f[oods]- foods would be	0
agent:fancier restaurants and and i thought uh i really liked the food you know it uh it was different because_1 you know you see all these things like you see all these chef's chef's shows and stuff like that|agent:but most of the time you know i was really surprised like i say going at these|user:so	uh-huh	1
agent:to occupy them_1 you can really tell|user:yeah|agent:yes so uh you know if they more you you can tell when they're oriented towards kids now if they bring something for them to play with or to write with something you know	yeah	1
agent:but|user:yeah|agent:so that was that was a couple things that we liked	well sounds good	1
user:but|user:uh|user:well in in that case [vocalized-noise] with him uh he kind of made the selections by himself and i think that we should have given him more direction and he was our first you know so we we didn't have quite the insight that uh that we would have had if he'd been our second like we did with Karen so	i i think you know i- just in terms of of what happened i think that first of all i'd i would know the reputation of the school	0
agent:between uh students i knew everybody within my dorm but that was it|agent:a[nd]- and for me i had to admit the one thing that i lacked was the uh interaction|user:oh gosh [laughter] is awful	uh-huh	0
user:yeah|user:uh-huh|agent:well i was when i was in Louisiana in Shreveport i would go to any school except LSU i did not want to school in the in the same state	same deal	0
user:uh that's something|agent:two hundred dollars as an out as an out of state student|agent:and see back when i went to school there when i first entered the school it cost me	uh	1
user:uh|user:uh [noise] i think uh on a yearly basis i'm trying to think i would just make it a rough figure of about|agent:well what about the University of Virginia how much did it en[d]- end up costing	with with the travel expenses and so on although she didn't come home that much [vocalized-noise] actually	0
user:all righty|user:yes|agent:well i tell you what i've enjoyed talking i'm going to go ahead and hang up on this end because it's just about time for supper so	yes it certainly is i got to go make it here [laughter]	1
user:well the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous i mean if one is determined that it's you know that he feels that he's you know going against the other eleven they all stay until everyone agrees|agent:and we have so many people already you know the jails are already overloaded|user:uh-huh	so i don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting you know just gives in	1
user:i think in in the end the judge has the presiding you know|user:i- i- i think|user:you know so it it's	um	0
user:i mean i think it's as fair as it can possibly get|user:i- i think it's just i don't|user:[laughter]	but	0
agent:[noise] infraction|agent:i don't know if you should ha[ve]- r[eally]- really have a jury for s[mall]- a small|agent:because uh [noise]	um-hum	1
agent:so [laughter] how long do we [laughter-need] [laughter-to] [laughter-talk] [laughter] do you know|user:yeah|user:um-hum	oh i think we can hang up anytime [laughter]	1
agent:yeah|user:uh-huh so that [vocalized-noise] th[ey]- you can't put them in plastic anymore|agent:oh really	and uh so that seems to be helping a little bit too	1
agent:yeah and i hadn't thought about that [laughter-so] i'm going to make everybody start doing that they think i'm nuts [laughter]|user:ooh that's a good idea|agent:but i was reading in a magazine the other day and i hadn't even thought about doing this that um a lady m[ainly]- mainly for cost cutting reasons has m[emo]- sent out a memo to everybody in her company that says if you're sending out interoffice memos it's got to be on the backside of a paper that's already been used	oh that's great	0
user:that's right|user:oh good|user:oh	that's right and my kids help a lot my son um	0
agent:i wish they'd get more into that|user:right|agent:yeah but i mean i guess there's only so much they can do as far as re[cycle]- as advanced stuff now but something else that i'd really like to get into more and i haven't is the like the Downy softener products and stuff that you just buy the concentrate	more people doing that yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:uh to where part of the diaper can be recycled or degraded|user:um and i i guess some companies are beginning to do some things	um but we did an interesting thing in my classroom um calculating	0
agent:okay	okay	1
agent:well i went to the University of Minnesota|user:what about you|user:um	oh so you're from the Midwest too	1
agent:areas to look at in making the decision|agent:on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford or you know there's all of these|agent:the reason i ask if you went to college is i thought well you know what were your selection criteria did you base it	um yeah those um and those were several uh	0
user:i ended up majoring in French one of the reasons i picked the school was because they had a strong science department|user:i and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing and|agent:oh how exciting	they also had a strong language department and i'd always loved working with children um	0
user:yes [laughter]|agent:well then he should come to U T [laughter]|user:think that	um and really his his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of	0
agent:but um|agent:so that's how you know my decision was made|agent:i i mean i just really couldn't look at anything else that was the one and only thing i could really afford other than a jun[ior]- you know a junior college which i didn't want to do	well th[at's]- that's certainly um	0
user:we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind does your daughter|agent:huh|user:yes he thinks that's what he'd like to do but he's really strong in math and science too and	know what she'd like	0
user:uh-huh|agent:well i think for me i i'm from Alabama south Alabama and so i grew up in the midst of civil rights movement|user:uh do you want to give a start on it	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:uh-huh|user:well like we live in the country [noise]|user:[noise] you can relate to that now see we didn't we don't have any of that because	in Clarion County and uh	1
user:uh-huh uh-huh|user:right|agent:at family in different p[eople]- family members' homes but even now you know they don't even do that	well they're so spread out i think has a lot to do with it	1
agent:but even just social visits people don't do that anymore you're right and people don't feel comfortable just to|user:uh-huh uh-huh|user:uh-huh uh-huh	no huh-uh they don't do as much	1
agent:go away i'm just one of the two|agent:most people didn't|user:uh-huh uh-huh	uh-huh	1
user:so [noise] well there's the main things i can think of i really|user:uh-huh|agent:probably	tried to think of some other things and i couldn't really	0
user:before they settle in because a marriage takes a lot of|user:yeah well even to get school finished i think a lot of times it's better if they do finish their schooling|user:uh-huh	effort and concentration [laughter] and if you're busy with school	0
user:uh-huh|user:that's right yeah|user:uh-huh	yes uh-huh	1
agent:well i live like fourteen hours from home|user:Maryland maybe five hour drive|user:Pittsburgh's not quite so bad it's just a couple hours	that's	1
user:airplane and they flew down last weekend they came down in it|user:uh-huh now my son they they flew he rebuilt a Aranca Chief|user:huh	and it still took a long time because it's not a fast it's not a high-speed airplane	0
agent:in particular had to be gray and white so|agent:and the cat was um gray and white|user:and the name stuck with you	okay	1
user:a child must have a|user:and but i believe the|agent:yeah	pet to grow up with so	0
user:claw|agent:do things in the house that i didn't [laughter-appreciate]|user:[noise]	now has it been declawed	1
agent:and we just you know one reason we|agent:and we look out at a creek and a park|agent:and we don't want a fenced in backyard we're on a corner	well what you have to do is have an indoor dog	1
agent:and after we moved in it was so bad that we had to go ahead and um recarpet the entire house [laughter]|agent:and um we did not realize that there was a problem|agent:when we moved into this house both dogs and cats had been in it	oh	1
agent:um-hum|user:i'm not sure if that was that good for them_1 or not|agent:oh yeah	but our dog does have plenty of company let me because of the uh we have a	1
agent:the other i'm not so sure about because of uh his attention span i think he's a little bit more easily distracted than was she|agent:uh one who seemed to do just fine in that tap type of atmosphere|agent:i've now had two children that are have been in the s[ystem]- in the system	oh	1
user:uh the curriculums differ so much and i'm not saying that that's bad necessarily but|agent:right|user:uh a particular group of students was doing	i think it makes very hard to tell where an actual problem is	0
user:you know it doesn't it doesn't|user:yeah i think that's kind of a good idea because|agent:something [laughter] magnet school uh next year when she enters high school	it doesn't divide people by	1
agent:oh not really uh i've not been that aware of it|user:and do you think that's healthy|agent:well	uh-huh	1
user:um|agent:yeah that's was very different uh they have middle school sixth seventh and eighth|user:now i didn't even realize that at all	right	1
user:well|agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	the weather has been certainly has been hot and it's been humid i don't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high	0
user:oh yeah|agent:well yeah see i i lived in uh Ohio mainly i lived in uh Pontiac just a little while before i came down here and you know so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather it might rain on your little parade|user:and all you know every day was cloudy almost every day was cloudy and i you you sort of forget how much it did rain and coming here and then it didn't rain it was just wonderful	that's right that's right	1
user:new career but uh|agent:okay|agent:okay	anyway so that kind of uh well i had been down here to visit so i finished school and	0
agent:you know like maybe a mile two long|user:yeah|agent:and it was wonderful being on the lake like that you know in the summer you feel like you're you know on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake and everybody's you know out enjoying the water and such and uh in the winter time the lakes froze over you could still kind of go sledding and such out there but i thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes there's lots of really small ones out there	yeah	1
agent:you know to go skiing and stuff|agent:we had uh Pine Knob|user:yeah	oh	1
agent:there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December be[fore]- couple days before Christmas it lasted only a few hours like by noon it was gone|agent:my first winter here i i came down in uh early eighty two and|user:okay at Christmas time	yeah yeah	1
agent:oh you could|user:well you know i i could uh pick the uh Chicago team|agent:that's right	yeah i got a lot of northern neighbors here	0
user:well is he a fragile uh football player you know they had an end or a a|agent:uh particularly probably down in the end zone where Troy can go back there and put one up in the sky and let him go up and get it|agent:he creates a real problem for people now	wingback or something like that that would go down the field and	0
agent:so far the players are are uh re[sponding]- responding well to|agent:that i think the|agent:bring in a new uh offense and new offensive system	and Jimmy's going to leave the offense to the offensive coach	1
agent:corrugated tin fence around it painted blue|agent:i think that was the place that had the looked like|agent:that's the one that	yeah and it had holes in it and it had big tire on it where	0
user:yeah i i i find myself uh when i go to the football games of uh|agent:well i guess i do too really|user:i've been to several games uh in my lifetime however i prefer to watch the uh watch the game uh via the TV tube	of uh missing a play by talking to somebody in the group	0
agent:they'll be successful and they'll have a lot more sellouts and fewer blackouts this year|agent:i'm hoping that|user:and yeah we just go down there and uh watch the game	yes absolutely and	0
user:and so uh|agent:that's right|user:say you know they think of one thing the Dallas Cowboys and the movie Dallas	i think that uh they will come back and Johnson while he's unorthodox i think he is doing a good job and he's all uh	0
user:is interested in making a dollar and and they've certainly gone to uh great lengths to|user:that uh owns that oilman and his partners that own the team uh|user:and i think also that oil man that uh	you know to	0
agent:is that right|user:i like well what i usually do is fresh water fishing i haven't been salt water fishing since i was about ten|agent:do you like uh fresh water fishing or salt water fishing	yeah	0
agent:uh in fact i think it had been over the spillway recently when we went it was back down|user:oh yeah|agent:one of the major major rains that we'd had	uh-huh	1
agent:i'll be|user:yeah follow that channel on up|agent:deep in the channel huh	but uh so now my cousin will i make him get up early in the morning and take me out striper fishing and then	0
agent:he had a two week period he he had to work with before he got shipped off to Germany|agent:course one year i went two weeks too early with a friend that was he at this point he'd graduated from college and was in the Army and|agent:uh	oh my goodness	1
user:that we'd you know go out fir[st]- we got everybody's tents up and camp made and all that and said come on let's go fishing|user:and uh so we go up there and we decided|agent:oh	we hauled in well we brought in	0
agent:uh-oh|user:well i have to watch it because Ashley'll out fish her brother half the time|agent:so i i'd like to break them in a little bit	and so you know that gets a little sore	0
agent:i haven't really done any of that uh|user:have you been um salt water fishing|user:anyway but	r[ight]-	1
user:coached some and went to all the games and|user:were in gymnastics or soccer or baseball or basketball whatever we were always involved in the parent club and|user:but uh we were very active with them when they were young [vocalized-noise] whatever [vocalized-noise] they	and course in Plano that's a big deal we'd	0
agent:mean that's that's one of my that's my downfall on my side of that that that aspect|user:oh|agent:it's kind of har[d]- hard hard with me just because_1 i'm in the restaurant business and i have to work weekends but my wife's there all the time and	um-hum	1
user:uh us[ually]- you know a lot of times it's a single mother trying to raise and of course i i deal with adolescents so that's where it fourteen fifteen that's where it really starts coming out this|user:at home because their parents are off working or|user:are looking for a family and usually find it within a group at school rather than	lack of of uh family life	1
agent:right|user:to your classes and things like that and and uh|user:they're the f[irst]- but they are the first ones that will come up and say you know you want to sit at my table in the cafeteria and let me help you	when you've got a a child that's just coming from a situation a move is a terrible thing on a child it's it's just such a traumatic especially if they've lived	0

agent:well they fear being dependent on somebody they they fear being a burden|agent:uh-huh|user:that's from the child's standpoint the child is going why don't you want to be close to me and your other family what does that house got attraction i never really thought of independence	uh	1

agent:yeah c[ause]-|user:have talked long enough|user:in fact i think we probably uh	would be my guess so	1
user:i guess that's [vocalized-noise] my|user:i just um|agent:grow up and mature and and realize what this country's all about	that's something that my family has always believed strongly in and um	0
agent:uh families for their friends where now i'm not sure they really do|agent:their|agent:you know for their communities for their	yeah well i think sometimes through groups and organizations um	0
agent:you know but eve[n]- even through those gr[oups]- groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to|user:number|user:but i i think that's a small uh	that could	1
agent:yeah|user:a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest so i know there is the possibility that|user:down to Austin and and i know	it could be out of the area	1
agent:i think you would have to start younger|agent:i'm not sure that that today's kids would go for it though|user:is helping others	yeah	1
user:i wish|user:um to handle it but|user:way	ah that's something that i think that has been lost in families and i think that's a good place to start again	1
agent:um-hum|user:that were common in the fifties are still there and um|user:and they've also see that there's there's a different way of life and those families are really close some of the things that we talked about	it really every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed and it's changed their perspective and	0
agent:okay bye|user:thanks bye bye|agent:you too	[noise]	1
user:but then the follow-up the next day was i was kind of glad to see because it it said that|agent:um-hum|user:working high school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades	you know yes but for those students who are determined to do well anyway	1
agent:your education|agent:right|user:but there still can be an attitude of you know this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now but but that the most important thing is still	you know getting your education well when they meant said the the topic you know of what's wrong with the public schools my my first im[pulse]- impulse was	1
agent:social problems uh mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security|agent:now are supposed to solve|agent:and school's	hm	1
user:you know at a|user:and i was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school and they said oh but we need more in the middle school because that's when kids are|agent:no it isn't	tougher and rougher age and all that but you know part of my feeling is that if you solve	1
agent:absolutely refuse to work with them on and occasionally that happens|agent:a child that really is in need of counseling help if they|user:to change yeah	right	1
user:the public education is the best|user:oh they have all these different names for things strategies and all these different things but anyway one of the key things was that that we believed that|user:uh [noise] you know	economic value	1
agent:where they don't try to educate everyone that's one of the things that we do we try to educate everyone|user:right|user:right	um-hum	1
user:um|user:the Plano school district's you know goal is that they will graduate every child that|user:and one of	that is here in the ninth grade i believe it's something like that it's worded	1
user:to be in situations and schools where we don't see that|agent:we are|user:i guess we're both lucky	my folks talk about it a lot in Illinois my mother is was a teacher for years and years	0
agent:isn't that wonderful|user:oh how exciting|user:oh	oh that is wonderful	1
agent:and uh [noise] we've just been real lucky [laughter] i think anyway to not|user:yeah|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:well that's hard it's so difficult for them um|user:uh-huh|agent:yeah yeah get the computers out and you know	uh-huh	1

agent:uh-huh|user:to see how you know it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard but we've got a Great Dane in the back and|agent:uh-huh	she has eaten everything i have put out there she's eaten my crepe myrtle trees	1
agent:um-hum|user:i know we can't either but i've got pre[tty]- two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard uh you know one on either side of the yard|user:oh i know ours don't	a[nd]- and they're big and [vocalized-noise] they're real full and everything you know in the summer time but it it's killing everything underneath	1
user:really|user:[laughter-yeah]|agent:so people can't see and hear too much [laughter] it just	and i've cut well i don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front	0
user:i'm|user:yeah|user:a lot	it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard and	1

user:you know wanted to get rid of these kittens and|user:uh|user:but we had these two that they we knew someone that uh	uh so we gave it a try	0
agent:really really huh|user:train to use we tried different types of litter|user:uh	changed it frequently and	0

agent:yeah|user:great|user:um-hum	well has the cat discovered the uh the hamsters yet	1

user:and celery|agent:uh-huh|user:and some mayonnaise and lemon juice	and that's it and some hard boiled eggs	0
agent:yeah that's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many|user:yeah that cholesterol fat free|agent:i guess i would now use the the new mayonnaise free	uh-huh	1
agent:right|user:and they don't need any added help|agent:yes [laughter]	so	0

agent:[laughter] i've had some from Plano too|user:no that's unusual seems like usually|agent:not too far away	oh yeah	0
agent:that involves a lot of different areas i think|user:uh|user:it seems to me that	does uh	1
user:let's see that's a bad tangent to get on|user:very poor|user:and they start out	what else has changed between the sixties and the eighties	1
agent:um there's and i think uh a lot of it is selfishness people have become very selfish they don't want to stay home with the kids or something like that there are a lot of|user:yeah|agent:do things with them you know	y[eah]- yeah	1
agent:um and a lot of it is discipline problems|agent:because of the problems in the schools|agent:can see more and more families going to it	yeah	1
agent:that's [laughter-right] Prissy get's you in trouble because you can't have them there|agent:that's right [laughter-i] [laughter-remembered]|user:one very old fat cat [laughter] Prissy and that's why Pat won't ever let me have a party at my house [laughter]	that's right	1

agent:yeah|user:like she always had|agent:yeah	and it's really neat for people living alone like you say with your friend	1
agent:yeah it was it was very traumatic my sis[ter]- it was really upsetting to my little sister and and um so tha[t]- it just we didn't have many pets growing up just because_1 our house wasn't conducive to that|user:that was traumatic wasn't it yeah|user:oh yeah	um-hum	1
agent:uh-huh|user:oh i just know it's going to come sooner or later so that's one reason i've been letting Emily talk about dogs because_1 i think|user:Prissy dying because_1 she's pretty old and fat and	uh we we say that's going to be the end but i think when it really comes to it we'll want another pet	1
user:and you know my aunt says that they do drug them i just went bananas when she told me that that was a fact that she had shopped kennels|agent:remember you know like|agent:yes he did i always wonder i think well now how much do they	and vets and that they all	0
user:yes|agent:-[with]out little ones at the table|agent:it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was just to you know have a moment of peace and quiet	yes	1
user:as well as|user:gourmet Mexican and uh things like that|user:and uh sort of	Tex-Mex and Italian	0
agent:their pastas were great|agent:and uh|user:uh-huh	tha[t's]- that's one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me	0
agent:i don't know you know what we read we read the uh D magazine|agent:well my husband's kind of the eth[nic]- he he's the ethnic fan so he's|agent:uh	uh-huh so do we	1
user:it's hard to resist so we'll go in and very often we'll find a place that we like and we'll stick with it once they|agent:that's right|agent:that's	give they they no longer give coupons we'll we'll uh we'll stay there	1
agent:and clear the table and|user:oh absolutely|agent:gosh it's nice it's nice to have somebody come and [noise] wait the table	and do the dishes [laughter]	1

user:personally i don't live in a|user:and uh|agent:uh-huh	real bad section of town but uh just because of the general area i live in the insurance rates are real high on your car and	0
agent:yeah there's a little boy that just got shot and killed like last weekend down in what they call the projects which is|user:just to be in a wrong location at the wrong time and and a lot of kids you know are caught that way|agent:yeah	but	1
user:uh-huh|agent:yeah they do that here too but i say you know they commit crimes let them be overcrowded [laughter] you know let them suffer a little bit|user:we can't at least in this area you know they don't have any room to put anybody so a lot of people just get out you know back on the streets because there's no they can't keep that many people in the buildings they have	i know it they have all sorts of	0
user:uh well i don't know i was watching on a movie on TV i don't know how true those can be but you know they one guy|user:and uh get them involved in things because|agent:yeah	got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them you know you won't have a record because you're under eighteen to steal cars and everything	1
user:yeah the same in some of the areas around here but|agent:yeah i think they have them in Dallas because i hear them talking about in the schools different things happening and they've had some drive-by shootings outside of the schools|user:to cover more area and i don't know if if gangs occur much down in Texas do they	i've never had any personal	0
agent:really yeah those machine guns and all that yeah that's scary it's a wonder there's anybody who's willing to be a policeman|user:some people are mo[re]- seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military i don't know where they get them [laughter]|user:it's true and the weapons my God the weapons that people have are	uh-huh	1

agent:oh|user:it's wonderful the only thing is you have to wait you have you have to expect to wait at least an hour|agent:no um but i've heard that's really good too and	so you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in and	0
agent:have you been to the little uh not for prime rib but the Cafe De France um right here on Central Expressway|user:i've i've never been there but i've heard it's real good|agent:yes i'd i had heard that too um	yes yes actually they have one in Richardson that i've been to	0

agent:you can't find them like that and|user:you can't find them yeah [noise] yeah yeah yeah|agent:uh their fruits are always exceptional i don't i'm know they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market uh	you know i- i'm originally from Connecticut and uh i was home a few years ago and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner and	0
agent:[noise]	[noise]	0
user:he had never really lived in a large town so we looked at|user:uh|user:well with uh John the first one he wanted to go into engineering so	good engineering schools in relatively small towns like	0
agent:uh-huh|user:he wanted to go into engineering and we thought that a coop program was a good way to get some experience at the same time|user:because uh	so that was kind of how uh we finally settled on small town and good engineering school with a coop program for him	0
user:to stick a little closer to home|user:Jana i think wanted to|user:and uh he was sold on the place	and	1
agent:major but not a whole lot there's a lot of campuses have business majors so that was|agent:so it was a bit of of the|user:uh-huh	sure	1
agent:yeah|user:not at all because y[ou]- you want to find something that you like to do not necessarily what your Dad does|agent:uh-huh	so uh	0
agent:when you start looking at the twenty to thirty thousand dollar price tag and you|user:uh-huh|agent:and uh their kids are are looking in on some of those eastern private schools	oh i know it	1
agent:it was it was quite evident [laughter] that|user:i haven't either|agent:uh i've never been out there but	uh-huh	1
agent:was giving|agent:um|agent:um i guess from from something that the car was	i think it gives off	0
user:uh on uh|user:what's interesting several years ago i took a course|agent:yeah	well it was actually it was put on by the power companies and about the various sources of energy and	0
user:perspective|user:so it's kind of interesting the change in|user:the accumulation of of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage	from when i took that course now a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear	0
user:uh-huh|agent:yeah i i get that sometimes um my line gets some static i don't know why|agent:yes	but uh	1
user:[laughter]|user:you know con[trol]- be able to control it i don't know how long that'll take but|user:it may not in all ways maybe they'll come up with fusion	one of these days because that's perfectly clean	1
user:uh-huh|agent:yes well and and for the future generations too uh|agent:yes	i've noticed students are are much more you know young young people are much more	0
agent:yeah|user:all right well i guess you know i- i wasn't expecting that question about AIDS so i haven't thought too much about it but i guess i think that we should have more research um i'm just concerned that it's just going to be such a major health problem|user:okay	and if we you know and if it's not	0
agent:you know at at least they're making progress but they've got to get it stopped they've got to find a cure|agent:so|user:yeah	w[ell]-	1
agent:uh-huh|user:you know i- i thought of that for myself for like for my children|user:it is really scary	this whole issue of the whole blood issue is very scary	1
user:but|user:i don't know i guess they might|user:i don't suppose anybody would give blood if they felt they	uh	0
agent:and just say well you know the research is going on is doing good enough because it's not there's no cure yet|agent:well y[eah]- that's right and they've got to do something about it they can't put it on the back burner|user:uh yeah i guess that basically i do think we just need more research because_1 that's going to sort of be the our only answer	well and i worry you know the older my children get the more expo[sure]- chances of exposure they're going to have	0
user:i know|agent:then we'll talk|user:i mean [laughter] i mean really	well it's just a	0
agent:only because he had connections that was not open to the public at that time|agent:over here|user:AZT	hum	1
agent:and he never smoked even a grapevine much less a cigarette|agent:but he i mean jeez he had everything under the sun he had hepatitis he had meningitis he got throat cancer|agent:so	hm	1
agent:yeah and his friend had died the year before|agent:yeah|user:awful thing to suffer through	well my	1
user:i don't know i c[an't]- think that i|user:well like um|agent:[laughter] we'll have some interesting discussion i guess	one of the reasons that i'm against it is that uh um i'm a[fraid]- afraid of	0
agent:or or capital punishment i guess you know and|agent:you know|agent:you know put him in jail for the rest of his life	right	0
user:you know i just recently moved to Massachusetts i'm not sure what their policy is on capital punishment and that was one of the questions but|user:that's true|agent:what they should be serving	uh	0
user:handed it to you [laughter]|agent:she picked up the phone and [laughter-when] she heard the topic she said capital punishment so she was uh [laughter] [laughter-yeah] well luckily it was for me because_1 they won't uh th[ey]- they coordinate the times so it can only be one or the other|agent:uh my wife and i are both participating in this survey and	oh oh i see	1
agent:people that are against it that may the[y]- yeah they may not even be on drugs yet they they call it an invasion of privacy|user:it|agent:yeah it['s]- it's refreshing to hear somebody that has a similar opinion as mine i mean all these	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|agent:how to administer that program just because you know you y[ou]- something can get mixed up in the mail or|agent:a well thought out sane approach to	um-hum	1
user:uh|agent:right|user:doesn't require the testing	to me	1
agent:get the same effect|user:um-hum um-hum|agent:right because it usually requires more and more of that substance that you're misusing to	um-hum	1
agent:yes i do|user:[laughter] kind of get off on a tangent here uh do you work for uh Texas Instruments|agent:yeah [laughter]	uh-huh	1
agent:it's been about three weeks since we had any [noise]|user:everything's really getting dry it's uh|agent:um	yeah it's kind of at a dangerous level here people hauling water and	0
user:objecting|user:i can see them|user:uh i can understand i know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them	you know there's a lot of people that think there's nothing wrong with	1
user:no no i'm sure it would have to affect you the same way|user:too uh|agent:yeah i mean uh uh from from a quality standpoint that's not i mean just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way	i i can't think that would [laughter-make] [laughter-any] [laughter-difference]	0
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:they they abuse it is what they do yeah	yeah	1
user:g[ood]- good understanding of it or a good|user:i guess i enjoy i enjoy jazz listening to jazz sometime although i don't feel like i have a good|user:you know	a g[ood]- good feel for maybe what's good jazz and what's not but	0
agent:my parents still do|agent:so we used to go and listen to them all the time and|user:oh you lucky thing	yeah	1

user:and i should be in a pretty good position because_1 i don't have little kids any more that i need sitters for or anything like that if i go to work it would be for our fun money|user:and well easily just [laughter-as] [laughter-you] [laughter-said] and i sat down and thought about it|agent:easily easily	and we realized that how it would [distrupt/disrupt] disrupt our travel routine and things like that	0
agent:true|user:you get everyone on your state|user:you're so you're higher but you get {out-of-towners} on that then	uh sales tax which is good	1

agent:[laughter-right] uh when you were talking about mentally losing sleep|agent:um um-hum|user:the house is starting to liven up here now [laughter] but uh that's about it that's kind of how my exercise is right now is just basically running after a three year old	so	1
user:um anyway uh i know here in here in Plano some of the things that we do are um Kroger and some of the other stores too have said if you bring your bags back to uh to the store to recycle|agent:yeah|user:that's okay it it's more uh concentrated so they know where you are [noise]	then they'll pay you a certain amount of money	0
user:so um that's always helpful [noise] and i know that we ha[ve]- we have the the can|agent:interesting|agent:um-hum	the can different can banks around the city	1
user:colored can to put them_1 in or or something in the city|user:and that might be an extra day to put out uh things that might be recycled if we had a a certain|agent:right	to put like either glass or newspapers or whatever	1
agent:yeah about six months ago i started and yeah and uh so what i do is uh|agent:[laughter]|user:recycling minded as i should be but uh that goes out with the trash and it really could be recycled	so	1
user:can you do that okay|agent:yes those also um and then of course uh cans Coke cans whatever|user:soda both liter sodas	right right	1
agent:[laughter] i don't mind the spending it's just that i trying to|user:my husband always says he earns it and i have to spend only what he earns|user:you are i think the women for the most part end up managing the money	it	1
user:and then i have another one but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point we're in a new home|agent:right|user:uh i don't always succeed at that i usually keep one with a low interest rate and i'd put things on there that i think i'm not [laughter-gonna] [laughter-give] [laughter-to]	and uh they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to	1
agent:uh-huh|user:and it has eighty two thousand miles on it|user:we had a car that we really liked	and we were kept saying boy wouldn't it be great if we could find another one just like it	0
agent:yeah|agent:[noise]|user:don't bring us the manager and all of that unless you wanna bring him right away you're gonna get one shot at us	we will [laughter-you] [laughter-know]	1
agent:i would love to just take some scissors and cut them_1 in half|user:um-hum|agent:like that [laughter] but um	[laughter]	0
user:and we still owe|agent:um-hum|user:four years ago	i mean i- i think like half [noise] of the amount that they cost in the first place	0
agent:[noise] oh|agent:[laughter]|user:[laughter-yeah] so then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before but also adding the lower payment problem [noise] so we were paying like twice	um [noise] so we didn't ever made that mistake again luckily [noise] but uh we're	0
user:[noise] yep|user:[noise]|agent:indigestion [laughter] and everything else	[laughter] sure that's true oh i just picked up my daughter and she was eating a cupcake and there are crumbs all over	1
agent:[noise] hi how you doing Doug my name's Brad whe[re]- where you from|user:[noise] i'm Doug	from Pennsylvania	1
user:and|user:whether you're able to do the job up to par|user:the measure of whether someone is to stay employed or not it is just performance	that and if that can be done it shouldn't	0
agent:sure|user:a lot are|agent:you know	probably not as good workers i think that most drug testing programs don't include that	1
user:yeah|agent:oh okay a little tribute to him or [laughter]|user:uh that's Miles Davis	uh right exactly it's on the radio	1
agent:i'll let you go ahead and start yeah|user:did you want me to go ahead|user:[noise] -[o]kay	okay	0
user:kind of realize hey there's just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all so it's it's kind of a|agent:yeah|user:right exactly and it's it's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything uh you know and then	a neat thing to see as far as equality in the households and i think that's even gonna get better	0
agent:yeah|user:you can be whatever you want to be and whether it be a welder a trucker or [laughter-whatever]|user:you don't have to stay with nursing you don't have to be a secretary you don't have to be	as long as you	0
user:i- i think that's [vocalized-noise] the gap is coming closer [vocalized-noise] as um|agent:that's right [noise]|user:well emotionally i think uh women [noise] do a little bit uh	what i've learned in uh just just	0
agent:[noise]|user:honey that's fine i will go out and make the uh|agent:[noise]	take care of the uh money making and it it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that	1
user:[laughter] okay|user:you'd organize|agent:well why don't you start because_1 you've had more time to think about [laughter-it] if you don't mind	the things that came across you know they said to make it memorable memorable but i thought first of all you needed to	0
user:um|user:some have had breakfast and lunch and it's been a whole day affair some [noise] of course just have lunch or|user:um the ones that i've attended	also like at Christmas time it'd be a dinner reunion	0
agent:um-hum|user:well that's a lot of it uh i know we tried several different ways one time we tried something that really worked but we didn't keep it up i passed it on to a friend and she won't quit doing it she loves it and that was the envelope system|agent:[laughter] i guess have self control	where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend and you put the cash in envelopes	0
user:right|agent:no because if you charge things and uh you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid or you get paid the last day or next to the last day you pay all your bills then there isn't anything left to spend anyway|agent:no	right	1
agent:and for most of uh i mean i'm a substitute teacher and i've only substituted i guess for the last fifteen years so there's only been really one working [noise] and uh [noise]|user:that's right|user:that's right	um	1
user:do you|user:it's kind of hard|agent:well we we eat out a a good deal at this point i- i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money so because i knew that you couldn't you know spending five thousand dollars on a vacation or whatever we were gonna go for ten weeks	yeah yeah	1
agent:and i never worried about saving money because we just we're in the savings plan at work and they took it out so|user:that that's excellent that's what i'm working toward i think you're probably much ahead of me there and i'm working on it|agent:yes	same here same here	0
agent:as of yet uh we're pretty small town|agent:in the works|agent:i don't really think we have anything	uh-huh	1
user:and um|user:and you put your bottles in it and paper|user:and uh just along with a trash can you have this this green plastic bin	you know all those things that [vocalized-noise] aluminum you know anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin	1
agent:yeah see it's not anywhere near that uh we uh you know as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans|user:yeah things of that nature so i guess when you live in a bigger city it it really becomes uh necessary|agent:oh that'd be good	[noise]	1
agent:[noise] yeah|user:of course there you know you have a specific place to put your paper|agent:what it's for	and uh they try to get you to go ahead and separate it but uh they actually have the door to door pickup	0
user:um-hum well the thing about newspapers and paper|agent:it it hasn't caught on yet i'm hoping it will soon|agent:usually it's	recycled paper is actually very expensive [laughter]	0
agent:you know beginning stages so|user:[laughter-okay]|agent:i can't either because_1 we're we're at a very	uh-huh	1

agent:there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs and everything so that's you know|agent:you know right now|user:i hope so too [laughter]	yes	1
user:uh|agent:oh it's very difficult i know|user:it's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty four hours a day	it she has Alzheimer's and does not remember	0
user:well|agent:i don't know what i'll do up there i- i just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes and|agent:and do the whole thing but you know if something would uh whenever something happens to one of them then	um-hum	1
agent:but i know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is and|agent:so uh|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:our|user:i think nursing homes are|user:i-	um	0

user:elderly people and and they really seen as wise and and in this country|user:a[nd]- that the older the older people in other countries that i've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the|user:like a respect issue	nobody really	1

agent:you don't|agent:[laughter]|user:well i still don't trust them_1 i'm sorry [laughter]	i probably never will	1
user:[noise] yeah but i don't i think they have just as much see bu[t]- i don't know i- i think that they have better like we you know when we go over in Iraq and Iran that's different country|agent:we would we would be on the offensive|agent:we're pretty serious and if they ever tried to do anything	but i think see that's why they don't have anything in the Soviet Union they spent more money	0
agent:right|user:they do it so|agent:right	i guess it would depend on what what state that they're in	1
agent:you know what are we doing|user:they're so into TV|agent:that that's another thing that scares me is our [laughter-country]	um-hum	1
user:[laughter] there's no way|agent:right|user:just because	especially when they've been such a	0
agent:well if it just keeps on going and nobody ever does anything that's fine with me|user:is probably the one|user:and i think whoever wins the the wait	yeah as long as i don't care about that they can do whatever they want but	1
agent:and we were laughing that we'd have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine|user:uh-huh|agent:they were talking about drug testing us	uh-huh	1
user:that's right|agent:you know people that really have other peoples' lives in their hands truck drivers it's supposed to be a|user:uh-huh	that's right	1
user:i agree i don't i won't do that|user:and uh if they say hey you can't do this work i'd say hey|user:you either need a job or you don't the the job is what provides all of your needs	and i think most of them_1 have agreed to that now although they didn't like it at first	1
user:a[bout]- about random testing|agent:y[eah]- well do we agree or unless it's it's not me [laughter] you know here we go again i mean|user:anyway [noise] we both a [vocalized-noise] sort of agree on it don't we	[laughter] well you see i	0

agent:oh uh-huh|user:Silence of the Lambs|user:uh	that wa[s]- that was uh [laughter] spine tingling	1
agent:it wasn't as well done i don't think|agent:there was they were kind of along the same lines but i i didn't enjoy that one near as much i didn't|user:um-hum	um-hum	1

agent:no not not at all [noise] if that's what is sounds like|user:so it wasn't an exploitation film uh|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:and so we would|user:and also where they were making tar|agent:um-hum	occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar and	0
agent:that's kind of the way Dallas is we're so flat and open and i live in a suburb that doesn't have much vegetation trees it was all cotton fields so|agent:[noise]|agent:um-hum	sure	1
agent:um-hum|user:ex[actly]- exactly and so my husband says well that's fine you know it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and you know the gas|user:yeah and	and no everybody has their preference to drive by themselves or	0

user:right|agent:because_1 it was so much cooler and so much more comfortable|user:uh-huh	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:i worked part time when my oldest was a baby|user:that would make a big difference	and um i had to wear a dress every day and	1
agent:that's true|user:yeah because_1 you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them_1 if you|agent:at least something cooler	especially if it's something that has to be dry cleaned which i don't have any [laughter-of]	1
agent:y[ou]- you were a bookkeeper [laughter] oh|user:i was held accountable so much i had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms|user:before we moved to Texas and the the one thing i see is changing is	for all the children everything had to be documented and i had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids it was filled with documentation	0
agent:i mean some kind of partitions you know|agent:really that much money to at least come up with|agent:well the explanation i was was given about you know they they seemed to admit that it wasn't working but they didn't have the money to restructure but looks to me that it wouldn't take	partitions or just to face the children different directions or to do something	0
agent:i guess so|user:probably so on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are|agent:how they get this this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money i don't know	so	1
user:for myself i'm|user:um|agent:okay what's your views on it	i'm personally against it	0

agent:did ev[en]- so even more than they are now|agent:um but if they|agent:i don't feel very comfortable with the metric system even though i was exposed to it	um-hum	1
user:well i don't know why the effort failed before but i have a feeling that it may have been businesses it would be costly for them to convert over|agent:what's the purpose of switching back and forth why are we different|user:[vocalized-noise] yeah	um especially some of the	1
agent:your kid into their home yeah|user:yeah|agent:so you're talking n[ow]- now you're pretty well limited to to home care then someone someone taking your your	right i don't thin[k]- well i think once my uh child got to be maybe four years old i might feel a little better	0

EMPTY	[noise] wondering how you keep up on the news	1
agent:i feel that that's not part of our responsibility|agent:well i can discuss a lot of the news that we have but um|user:[noise] right i think that you know we've we've resolved the issue and that's what we were asked to do	right [noise]	0
agent:uh the the waves were huge i've never quite seen waves like this one [vocalized-noise] and uh|agent:uh|user:uh-huh	um-hum	1
agent:we usually go up to Wisconsin at least once a year because this is where my husband and i are both from and|agent:[laughter] oh i'm|user:that's right that's right you got that	um-hum	1

agent:well if they close it in see we'll have the best of both worlds then|agent:oh i know|user:well i tell you this the weather here and there's no mountains or anything you know and when you go to a football game in Colorado it's you know there's snow and it's an adventure [laughter] and here you know you just got to drive [laughter-down] to the to the stadium and uh	yes	1
agent:course they put together some real cute songs and we all ran out and bought the records and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item|user:yeah|user:it's exciting	yeah yeah they probably i i wish i would've bought the tape when i was in uh Te[xas]- in Colorado	0
agent:um|user:exactly|user:yes	there's uh maybe some short term things that they can do and it hurts everybody's pocket of course but um	0
user:a[nd]- and the only other avenue that i can think of is um looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as|agent:[noise] right|agent:right	saying [noise] well we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at	0
agent:[noise] but then|agent:but|user:sure	yeah	1
agent:oh politicians talk a lot about waste but i'm not sure that that's really that much of the|agent:well that's right the i think that|user:of course when they get caught then they're you know they're guilty of course but uh during that time i'm sure there's hundreds of uh thousands of people that are um spending money that does not belong to them	um-hum	1
agent:[noise]|user:uh-huh thanks bye now|agent:all right you too bye-bye	[noise]	1
user:and we do have a very|user:i don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a pe[t]- you know another dog|user:and uh	loving cat that's you know	0
agent:their adoption includes their spaying|agent:and the humane societies or whatever|user:yes	yes yes	0
user:cats are usually so independent but this one you know he comes up and he crawls up next to my husband now you know uh|user:you know and and just love her and he's|agent:yeah	he's you know [laughter] right before the dog died	0
agent:you know i guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them_1 enough [laughter]|agent:it's just really awful and that's that's one real drawback but|user:um-hum	yes you will you will you know we	0
user:uh-huh|agent:yeah St[alin]- [Staling/Stalin] was a was a classical example i guess of that paranoia because he he probably killed more Russians than uh you know the Russian army killed anybody else|user:sure that happens [noise]	sure	0
user:uh|agent:yeah you're uh i think you're right there's a little more craziness down there [laughter]|user:to them that would be a suicide and they and the Russian people are not suicidal type of people but if you get the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of you know doing whatever uh for their country they'll do it	[noise]	1
agent:um|user:sometimes i have a hard time understanding the random|user:you know i don't see anything wrong with them telling you that you might have to go through one and and then	you know the i'll pick you out and i'll pick you out and i'll pick you out	0
user:yeah where i|agent:[laughter-so] you can't p[rove]- prove that|user:uh-huh	yeah where i was hired they made us sign something saying that we could be	0
agent:um-hum|user:yeah that's how i feel too|agent:um-hum	i don't know have you been in Dallas a long time or	1
agent:um-hum|user:and i've looked at an accounting positions|agent:um-hum	and definitely a [vocalized-noise] a position i've applied for has either come up	0
agent:um i think because it she's in the extracurricular thing cheerleading they they said they could but um|user:can a high school do that|agent:hum	uh-huh	0

agent:uh-huh|user:about all the gardening i want for the year so i'll be anxious to to|user:really did the landscaping this year so i've got	let it rest for a little bit	1
agent:um-hum|user:that's very okay it's very very different than ours because_1 ours ours we get into a lot of combinations of rye and Kentucky Blue|user:uh-huh	and uh plus the usual amount of crabgrass weeds and everything else that pops through and	0
user:and uh the alternative is a lot of uh nitrogen overpowering with nitrogen fertilizer and|agent:um-hum|agent:huh	certain chemicals but everybody is so chemical shy anymore that we steered clear of it and hopefully you know come s[pring]- come spring it will be cleared up and everything will be back to normal	1
agent:but uh you know the rye grass and the uh wild grass that grow makes us a nice lawn|user:um-hum|agent:uh or automatic on the sprinkler system	um-hum	0
agent:yeah and then you don't stop to realize that you know you charge this for twenty charge that for twenty charge this for twenty and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars and you don't stop to think about it|agent:uh-huh|user:six months ago and i find that i[t]- it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldn't get [laughter]	yeah	1
user:and|agent:jeez|user:she has hers is up to nine hundred dollars and she doe[s]- she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because_1 she's going to school	and so i mean that's just enough to pay rent and buy like [laughter-thirty] five dollars worth of food a month so and and pay for her like	0
user:yeah i'm|agent:you know so|user:[laughter] i bet	i don't know i'm about_1 sick of mine right now	1
agent:kind of got your head together in the credit department for you sound pretty young so|agent:well that's good i'm it sounds like you|user:hm	yeah i'm nine[teen]- i'm twenty right now	0

user:[vocalized-noise] yeah|user:[laughter]|agent:oh yeah they may not they must not have too much traffic on Saturdays	have you done a lot of this	1
user:um i think if uh they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and|user:verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits|user:everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable	uh individuals um helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how	0
user:uh i know a little bit about the uh European uh universal health care and there's some pros and cons one of the things of course is everybody gets health care but uh sometimes health care|user:yeah the only i- i know that um|agent:um	uh when you get into a universal system lacks in	0
agent:yeah|agent:yeah|user:the quality i think goes down um-hum when you have a universal system	um the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check um and also offering some kind of because i think uh all physicians well anybody um	0
user:and how they can do it i have no idea|agent:yeah|agent:that's right	um i know working for small corporations and health insurance	0
user:[laughter]|agent:[noise] well that's a good question we just got in from looking at cars and we've probably been looking at them_1 for a couple [laughter-months]|agent:[noise]	oh you have okay	1
user:and so we're kind of stuck on that kind of a car but|user:um the reason we're stuck on Fords i guess is because_1 i used to sell Fords|user:but	i really like um that kind of car myself but	1
agent:yes yes we we were [laughter] we were all in them_1 today but you know when it comes to oops|user:that is a neat car don't you think|user:uh-huh and isn't that neat though	[laughter]	0

agent:yes|user:or something like that now but|agent:uh-huh	but um	0
user:and the other thing is uh|agent:right|user:they really don't [laughter-have] enough to keep them_1 busy and keep their noses at in their own business and what they're doing	besides that i think uh two things that very definitely need looking at one is foreign aid	0
agent:but|user:[noise] yeah they don't they don't seem to|agent:and uh seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from from that direction	well	0
agent:serious|user:[noise] but that's uh|agent:[laughter] we['re]- we're being	[noise] yeah i don't know what we're gonna be able to do about it but i guess it's been around so long that	0
user:i don't think we'll be able to do anything about it so|user:sometimes feel like i'm being used [noise] but uh [noise] again|user:uh paying for some of these fringe benefits that [noise] people are entitled to but i just i just	[noise]	1
agent:um-hum|user:and i find it one of the best and uh|agent:um-hum	otherwise it's just one of the regular uh	1
user:i don't know it i kind of quit reading it oh i don't know several years ago when|agent:uh-huh|user:if he thinks there's something that i need to know about he'll say you know here you need to read this and uh	the kids were teenagers it just seems like i was so busy all the time	0
agent:you just want to know and with interest you know found some people that were members of our church which was different th[at]- that made you even feel a little more kin [laughter-to] to what was going on|user:yes yes|agent:i guess you just you know you	you found some members of your church that had been murdered	1
agent:yeah|agent:right|user:i noticed that my grandchildren seemed to kind of enjoy that the oldest one he's nine and uh he would particularly enjoy this been a couple of years ago	and uh	0

agent:and you know the recent thing with the UN going in there and the the|user:yeah|agent:if you look at um Iraq for example	um-hum	1
agent:uh-huh [noise] that's probably a bonus on our part [noise] yes it is|agent:[noise]|user:i think that's really uh probably what started the whole process [laughter] i	yeah	0
agent:yeah|agent:[noise]|user:all of the Arab bombings and terrorist attacks and whatever	and they have to negotiate	1
agent:especially not a federal prison|user:you know unless they really make it rough on them_1 that's not a going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i don't think|user:and so many of those kind of people uh they got they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway so	right	0
agent:but there have been [vocalized-noise]|user:um-hum|agent:the death penalty is not given often	it's not here either really	1
user:yeah|agent:somehow you know it doesn't really balance out too much|user:um-hum	that's right somehow it just doesn't it works and then again it takes too long for it to work	1
user:they're robbing and killing and|user:problem with the people on drugs because_1 that they with the drugs they're|user:ye[ah]- that's true it is overcrowded because there's so much drug uh	uh that's why it's filled the prisons up so much i think	1
user:uh|user:well|user:[noise]	and that's an idea that's been around for	0
user:but [vocalized-noise]|agent:uh|user:no i don't think it's it's nece[ssary]- n[o]- i think of that it it it couldn't be military service is not that much	military used to do it but the idea that	0

agent:say less advantaged areas|user:um-hum|agent:you know areas economically uh	um-hum	1
agent:uh it's it's really a gift to yourself and and that's i think that's a r[eally]- a really important lesson to learn|user:yeah|agent:and there's there's no question that doing you know doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than uh than the people involved	yeah	1
agent:why don't you start i'm trying [laughter-to] [laughter-remember]|agent:well let's see|agent:[noise]	okay i've seen uh oh Necessary Roughness	0

user:yeah|user:um-hum|agent:i find that a little irritating because i don't think it's always so necessary	yeah it it becomes it uh maybe to you and i who have grown up in some	0

user:yes that's been one of the areas for for|user:and if [noise]|agent:[noise] especially down here in Texas where we had a big a bunch of problem with real estate down here and savings and loans	for problems in that	0
agent:uh|user:uh i'm not sure but what um [noise] what that's intended t[o]- to mean|agent:[noise] anyway i think the solution in my opinion is to have something political to talk about is for the government to get out of business and leave us alone rather than get into business what's your feeling	uh	1
agent:ah|user:[noise] yes that's certainly true i'm not sure whether it's bad or not|agent:once they pulled out the controls look how many went under and say bye-bye	um my sense is that	0
user:uh well i guess the feeling as much as i hear by|agent:change of subject let's jump to Russia what's the feeling over there on the east coast about what's Russia doing and|agent:[noise]	is that uh Gorbachev is is is done for	1
user:[vocalized-noise] the old regime still wouldn't have survived but it w[as]-|user:it would've made a difference had there been violence ah|user:well [laughter-it] [laughter-would've]	it was to been bloodier than it's been through this point	1
agent:you know i mean it just depends on how brutal you know the you know murderer|agent:well uh i'm all for it in certain situations and if it's uh|user:what do you what do you what do you feel about capital punishment	sure	1

user:and for that guy to walk free if i mean he deserves|user:a rapist goes out|agent:somebody just	to be executed as far as i'm concerned if they get the hard facts on him and he is guilty	1
agent:exactly yeah there's|user:that's the damndest thing i ever heard of you get five days credit so if you if you uh get a sentence of five to seven as far as time served in one year you're eligible for parole|agent:right	that's ridiculous	1
agent:every few years like for an example would be the gov[ernments]- South American governments|agent:um you know it'll have a a coup or some ridiculous form of government there may change uh|agent:they've changed uh	right	1
agent:yeah well that that's just it i'm i'm twenty four and i'm in the military|user:an[d]- like you said unless there's [laughter-something] [laughter-really] [laughter-important] i just don't take the time|user:i for instance i haven't voted since i was eighteen just like i'm twenty two now and i don't live at i live out of the state that i'm registered to vote in and it's just	uh-huh	1

user:but uh|agent:[laughter] yeah i- i worked on some of it at TI once upon a time|user:but i guess they're going going pretty far into it now um Star Wars is not too [laughter-far] i don't think	oh have you	1

agent:research will go on|agent:no it's still probably going but i don't know whether it it|agent:oh	yeah but the economy the way it is all over them_1 they probably cut back on	0
user:but that the guy that's taken over for Gorbachev he's supposed to be uh|agent:[laughter]|agent:um-hum	he's supposed to be on our side isn't he	0
agent:so so he's able to do quite a few things like that and saves quite a bit of money|user:oh that's interesting|agent:yes he does and he's lucky in that way too because his his dad lives real close and he has a lot of the tools	that that's great what	0

agent:uh you know we have cold spells that that happen but but aside from that usually the temperature probably average temperature is thirty five forty degrees during the winter so this is kind of normal|agent:we don't usually stay below freezing uh for long periods of time|agent:uh yeah it's pretty normal today is pretty normal today it's probably about [noise] thirty thirty five degree well maybe thirty degrees out now and it's supposed to go up to forty and then that's about normal we don't	well we had we had early	0

agent:well that's fun yeah we we our little community doesn't have a movie theater but we|user:so it's it's a really nice place to go|agent:oh	yeah	1
agent:to try and make their money and so so do you watch do you enjoy movies or|user:that's right|user:yeah	yeah	1
user:yes|agent:oh a cou[ple]- um probably six months to a year before they go to the dollar dollar theaters|agent:well like you say around here we have to wait	yeah	1

agent:yeah yeah|agent:oh yeah|user:and uh i it would be hard for me to turn it down if if there was if the offer was there	uh they say it it really is something the the one of the things though that i think that's so	0
agent:well and we're probably going to be the only nation for some time now that could possibly afford or be uh far enough along to continue with this kind of a program you know with with the USSR|agent:yeah that's true|user:it it's important to take a global view and what better way to to do that than to to see it up on Earth i mean from outer space	yeah	1
agent:[laughter] why couldn't we get something simple like movies or books something more uh more fun|user:[laughter-yeah] [laughter-we] [laughter-do]|agent:uh we have quite a in depth subject here don't we	exactly some of the boring ones you just kind of babble on i [laughter-guess]	1
agent:you know i've never had any problem with being drug tested and i wouldn't think that other people should have either i guess that's sort of a personal opinion|agent:the occasion but|agent:and uh well a lot of times i think it depends upon	yeah	0
user:yeah|agent:you know they don't have to take that job if that's the way they feel about it|agent:there are people that say we're violating the civil rights and what have you but they don't have to [laughter-enroll]	yeah and i think the second part to that is you know they're also violating civil rights when they're using these dr[ugs]- illegal drugs	1
user:kind of like what you were saying that it's just i don't know to me that's it's putting the focus back where it should be you know sure|user:abso[lutely]- i think it's important that we remember that it's not the job that's important thing it's it's the individual|agent:and uh you know it's just really a shame that he he couldn't get enough help to keep his career going	some people might not appreciate it but when it comes right down to it you're more worried about the individual and where their status is	1
agent:uh seeing as how i'm sixty four i- i- i've seen them_1 all|agent:[laughter-well]|user:you wanna start [laughter]	oh really	1
user:[noise]|agent:uh uh the the women's occupations change to everything|agent:and i've seen	[noise] um-hum	1

user:yeah that would be just too much of a fall for me|user:[noise] yeah|user:[laughter]	um	0
agent:uh you get little spider web cracks all around uh windows and doors|agent:drastic changes in temperature or in uh moisture|agent:but anytime there's a change in the weather like the temperature uh	well that sounds like a lot of fun	1
user:give it a textured sort of a look|agent:i expect that's what it is yeah|user:almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall	and made for kind of a hard shell on the on the drywall	1
user:of course there's always the problem of the twelfth republic Georgia that's|agent:uh being as one political entity or whether it's really just going to be kind of a loose confederation|user:well	in a civil war right now what happens with them	1
user:i don't know if these all are really independent countries|agent:what Russia's going to bid for is the seat on the Security Council but i suppose that all of the other eleven can or the ten others or however many there are can be admitted as regular members of the UN|agent:well [vocalized-noise] i think the	or like states in the United States it almost looks likes some ways like the old Confederate States of America	0
agent:well that's true probably for any of them_1|user:oh i think one person put it aptly the ruble is rubbish|agent:and uh	course then the problem is what they do with their nuclear weapons that's the more interesting problem	1

agent:uh-huh [noise] that's right|user:uh she met my father and they married and she had to quit teaching school because she was a married woman|user:uh grad[uated]- well she took one year of normal school and then she taught school for three years before	so it it's changed a lot from then	1

user:families that the|user:uh in those|user:yes i definitely think so and especially	husband does not have a college education	1
user:i i'm grateful that none of my {daughters-in-laws} at this time are working|user:than just a wife because i'm i'm not just a wife but a wife|user:than	because they all have small families and they're just i just think it's so sad when a [noise] mother has to get a tiny baby up in the morning	0

agent:uh-huh|user:yeah and really you know they say that they're going to help them be productive but basically what they all do is they lay on their beds all day|agent:forget them_1	and it just to me that seems really sad	1
user:yeah and see that's i couldn't do it i think that that'd be super tough just because_1 the people that you learn to love you see|agent:they don't have enough help to go around|user:yeah	dying off one by one and i think that would just be really	0
agent:no they're really not|agent:no|user:it's sad because really they're not an[d]- to me at least it doesn't seem like they're very well taken care of and any of them_1 that	but	1

user:no|agent:and there's usually not very much business i mean some nights it's just real real quiet so|user:you're stuck together	i would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part	1

agent:yeah yeah me too [laughter] yeah i don't watch very much of it at all|user:well i shouldn't say i could not but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without|user:whereas uh i'm the type of person i could not s[it]- sit s[till]-	doing something	1
agent:i don't know it's kind of hard to describe i mean it's kind uh you have to kind of see it because it wasn't what i expected because i was thinking it's going to be just kind of a typical rundown of what you know you've heard the past you know ten years but um|agent:pretty much an order pretty much|agent:it's the most plausible theory that i guess um theories that they kind of pulled together in kind of a um	yeah	1
agent:yeah|agent:when it came out|user:yeah well my my even my grandchildren like it	so it it's been a good movie and we've we've really	0

user:knees and my hips|user:uh the the running was just too hard on both my|agent:but he felt like that was just too hard on his joints too so he he	and the um stationary bike keeps you toned and is keeps the stress off of the joints	1
agent:right|user:and the bicycle but today i just do the bicycle because i can do the bicycle a couple of days in a row but the weights you have to do those every other day|user:you know even even yesterday on Christmas day i was on the i did the the weights for a while	so	1
user:calories expended and you know it has levels of difficulty from one through nine and|user:your pulse and and and your miles per hour and|agent:but	so forth but i don't even remember the name of it any more	1
agent:yeah well um would like if do you think you're gonna have to it's gonna come to that|user:so|agent:i see	i hope not i we wi[ll]- we will do everything in our power not for it to	1
user:and another thing i'd check on is the food|agent:yeah|user:um-hum and i would check on cleanliness	my sister-in-law was in in one and uh she ju[st]- just had her hip replaced and so she just went to one you know for the li[ttle]- time for it to exercise and thing	0
agent:oh that wouldn't be too bad|user:well the one that i that i we would put my mother in would be about three miles from my home|user:um-hum	and so i would check her t[o]- i mean she was in there when she had her her hip replaced too	0
agent:it's a tough decision to put to put them_1 in there and then|user:what|user:[noise]	oh it is and i[t]- and i[t]- you know it's a tough decision to take them into your home when you're used to your freedom	1
agent:well it's kind of like you know you put them_1 in there someone else so someone else can take care of them_1 and then you really wonder you can't feel really confident that they're being taken care of|user:they just wither away and|agent:yeah	no no i don't	0
agent:yes uh|user:oh really|user:[noise]	there's been a lot	1
agent:[laughter] but|user:oh|agent:a low crime area because it's got great police to a higher crime area	oh	1
user:have you know increased and i|user:the murders have been on the rise where some of the other crimes have either stayed the same or declined but the more violent crimes like rapes and murders|user:um	and i think like you said it's a lot linked to the drugs to the drug	0
user:you know drugs and that and that's probably the biggest problem we have right here in the community is is these kids coming up|agent:uh-huh|user:the kids go up there for their beer parties and	up a canyon here and going up south for that kind of a thing and that brings a lot of	1
agent:they were stolen from i have three dogs three large barking|user:you're kidding|agent:that uh i used to have the windows replaced on that that i say monthly three times though	uh-huh	1
agent:[laughter]|user:[laughter] it might deter them well they say that that deters a lot|agent:they're lies but you know	a lot of would be you know burglaries	1
user:on the news said that|user:uh somebody|user:gosh i'm trying to remember where it was but recently	one of the problems with uh AIDS research	0
agent:on useless stuff anyways i mean|agent:where s[o]- so much money gets spent|user:yeah the general	yeah the general human	1
user:the uh|user:i don't know it you know|user:yeah	funding situation seems to be the same f[or]- for so many of the	0
agent:i guess once that happens and it you know it's gettin[g]- close you know|user:go running all over the place and|agent:yeah i still don't know anybody personally that's had it i mean i say	yeah	1
agent:you know si[nce]- there something like that gone on down there or|agent:i was jus[t]- jus[t]-|agent:there's been a lot of people you know protesting that lately out here and [noise] i didn't know	um right now	0
user:course then again most of the people who are protesting the cut in the budget would probably be just as upset if they raised the tax city taxes to cover the costs|agent:you know i don't know i mean|user:yeah	uh-huh	1
user:[laughter] yeah exactly|agent:yeah but what we didn't consider was coming back and forth and things like that [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [vocalized-noise] yeah really so that's kind of|user:oh is she	yeah	1
agent:so that's kind of hard too but|user:yep that's for sure|agent:and they can't always	you learn to appreciate what you had [laughter]	1
user:it became a thing like you said where you're|agent:yeah|user:yeah and it was it was it was frustrating you'd see a TA once a week and even the TAs rarely knew who you were so	where you're competing either to	0
agent:[laughter-yeah] [laughter-but] she was the only twirler they've ever had [laughter] so but that's what she's doing out in California that's why she's out there|user:oh cool|agent:she twirled	[laughter]	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah see and they say that that's average because_1 that's very common so maybe that's not such a great reason to look at a school i don't know|user:uh i have three or four [laughter-times]	yes i think for me personally when i was choosing i was looking more the overall experience instead of just	0
user:years ago|user:fish in the office may dad used to have fish in his office|agent:a female and a and a male and at the office i have tropical fish how about yourself	we've got three cats	1

agent:i don't know you know it seems like it seems like we ought to be able to get a little bit uh things ought to be a little bit more efficiently run and i i i|agent:sorry cutting it hard but um|agent:[laughter]	yeah	1
agent:and you know government just doesn't do it|agent:right right you know th[ere]- there there isn't there isn't the business cycle where where where government gets uh gets chopped down you know i mean a[nd]- they they don't go through a restructuring y[ou]- you know even IBM going through a cutbacks right and|user:that you know y[ou're]- you're you're not getting what you're paying for a lot of times whereas in any other business situation it'd be see you you know	yeah	1

agent:be successful and that they will decide to go ahead and and spread it to our neighborhood as well|agent:i think so too i i am uh in hopes that that will|user:right it seems like it would be better all the way around if there were more curbside recycling	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:but that is it used to be such a pain and it's so far away from us and that's the only one she knew of|user:um-hum|agent:and they would take everything	[laughter]	1
user:um|agent:but there are even groups of parents that are Recycling Coalition type deal where they're really making speeches to the PTA and the Dad's Club and everything trying to get more parents involved|agent:and it's uh surprising some of them_1 aren't but that probably goes right into their families	um-hum	1

agent:but uh anyway i don't know i know there's a lot of plants here when i drive down you know along the just along the freeway there's a lot of plants that they're burning things and|user:that's an interesting thought|user:hum that's a	um-hum	1

agent:well you have you have family lives too close together they see each other too often they uh they don't take that kind of thing seriously|user:so|user:it just kept growing and growing and growing and growing and we're going oh my gosh	uh-huh basically	1
user:yeah that makes a big difference too|user:oh|agent:every year everyone asks when is it happening and where is it happening and they just plan on being there	when everybody's real eager to participate	0
user:is um [noise] which is my dad's part side of the family is planning a [vocalized-noise] reunion um|user:my grandmother in California|user:my uh	this spring but we won't be going because um	1

agent:well my see my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that because they they moved into a neighborhood and bought a a real nice stone house down in in South Austin|agent:hum|user:the codes a little bit and so that's kind of why i guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any an[d]-	oh uh-huh	1

agent:[noise] i think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes|user:you know things there's been an awful lot of social change lately and a lo[t]- and uh|user:and so i think uh	um-hum	1
agent:oh yeah|user:you think that's great|agent:i think it's great	that someth[ing]- yeah because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position they they're very comfortable they lose the ability to learn	0
user:yes i agree with that i agree with that|agent:which i think's gonna be a hard thing for for people to face|agent:and not giving them_1 the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes	so i i believe that uh an individual should really learn how to to learn	0
agent:renegotiation within themselves|agent:such a uh big uh|agent:big change since Russia has undergone	yeah	1
agent:um-hum|user:uh give them_1 some tax credits i think they've done that i seems like i remember that happening once in my past i'm in my forties and i|agent:um-hum	basically remember getting some sort of [trax/tax] tax credit years ago and i think it helped i think we bought a car	1
agent:um-hum|user:every year it seems like she's got a new suggestion|user:the lady who does my taxes for me	and sometimes i go with them and sometimes i don't uh since i no longer work	0
user:so it took some while to adjust to it and it and it took some adjusting financially|agent:hm|user:i know for the i thought maybe i would go back to work especially during that first year and then they finally decided that then maybe i'll never work again	and things like that i can no longer afford [noise] things that maybe i used to take for granted	1
agent:but books i could talk about you know forever i [laughter]|user:[laughter]|agent:[noise] but i- i also picked gardening and [laughter] i mean i tried to talk about that for five minutes i don't really garden very [laughter-much] [laughter]	uh me too what kind of books do you read	1

user:yeah|agent:you know in the top ten uh of their class and their S A T scores are very low and a lot of it h[as]- has to do with their uh [noise] their reading ability you know their their language an[d]-|agent:you know there are some students who are in the top ten percent of their class even some who are maybe	oh definitely yeah	1

user:i would expect yeah yeah|agent:sometimes when you've moved perhaps your family reunion if there ever one would would be back in Michigan i mean that would be where your roots would be|user:[noise] but uh	and i know that my grandparents' families were fairly large but my father has just one brother and my mom has one brother	0
user:aunts and uncles|agent:they'd just be your great-aunts great-aunt your grandparents' siblings would be your great aunts and uncles|user:so perhaps my grandparents siblings would be my great great	[noise] right right	1

agent:do i keep a pet that i love or do i live unhappily in a neighborhood paranoid of whether he's ever gonna bark or not [laughter]|user:well|agent:i've got to live in this neighborhood so it's almost boiled down to do i	well that's a shame you know and you c[an]- i know you can have their barker taken out but who'd want to do that	0
agent:and now there's women in it and i think that affected a lot of things|user:yeah|agent:because it used to be strictly male and the views on it used to be strictly male	well i think that's a big contributor i think women have uh really	1
user:penetration of a lot of these fields by women and [noise] i think|user:uh|user:one of the best things that has happened in the twentieth century has been the	it's gonna continue	0
user:change their attitudes|user:there are a lot of attitudes that have to change and i guess that's the big thing you know as people|user:well i think	that's gonna make the biggest difference women	0
user:so it's it it's really changing attitudes and|agent:um-hum|user:uh views differ from those of her mother a generation before	um the economic necessity and the political changes as you pointed out are going to make a big difference i think	1

user:and if there's something i don't necessarily think it needs to be driven down again|agent:yeah|user:costs of dental work are pretty high	but to keep it from shooting up	0
agent:well i think that's sort of happened universally to all our industries i think our light plane industry went out of business because the uh cost of uh manufacturers' product liability was too high|user:but uh|user:you know two or three years wages down the toilet	yeah	1
user:yeah uh|agent:uh of the results|user:yeah	from what i've seen the better physicians are quick to ask you to go ahead and get a second opinion	0

agent:that the people who teach really know how to teach|user:oh i see oh|agent:um Amherst Wesleyan Williams College um [noise] those are places that that in academia are generally regarded as the best places to get liberal arts educations [noise] on the other hand you can go to a big university and do very well and some big universities i don't know whether Bringham Young is like this but some have a small college feel to them you don't get a lot of foreign TAs y[ou]- i mean in other words	oh yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:i don't think the teachers get enough support quite honestly|user:there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system i think the	but uh	0
user:your allocation's cut from the state or the feds or whatever your you you have to have a certain amount of kids in your class every day and|user:you know if you do that then|user:you're not allowed to send them_1 home	just it's it's a numbers game i don't think that's right if they're especially if they're interrupting the class and	0

agent:yeah i keep thinking that myself i|user:i would imagine a lot more people have it than they think and|user:you really i don't even think they have really a de[cent]- a decent idea of how many people really have it i	[vocalized-noise]	1
user:we're getting all this people asking us for aid outside the country you know or to [vocalized-noise] support the Soviet Union this that and the other and|user:and you just wonder i you know i look at kind of now too where|user:yeah	you know i sometimes wonder if it's not time we started you know maybe turning some of that stuff back towards home and	0
agent:i think his wife said something with well like we've got to keep these countries in a democratic mode|user:uh-huh|agent:you know giving away right now uh the president was	uh-huh	1
agent:and now that|agent:but there really should just be more|agent:you know where the money gets ate up at and	more money spent	1

user:that is it's and i say i don't have any idea how much and there ought to be probably a lot more spent to|agent:yeah|user:you know little kids and stuff like that that	to find out i just i just hope they kind of keep things in perspective and remember there's a bunch of other	1
user:well good [laughter] so you're goo[d]- you're using it|agent:oh definitely oh definitely uh it's it's boring [laughter] no no|user:do you have that set up where you can uh listen to some music or read a book or you just uh go	yes [laughter] because_1 you don't see a whole lot on a stationary bike	1

agent:uh|user:uh|agent:so p[robably]- so probably the things that i enjoy reading relative to military you would enjoy The Web Web Griffin stuff	uh not familiar with it	1
user:uh|agent:um-hum|user:it was this last summer yeah	now if it	0
agent:so i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and and spending too much money on something that was kind of uh more of a problem than it was rewarding so|user:oh|user:um-hum	um-hum um-hum	1

user:uh|user:i found out with at least the two department stores we've done business with for years they treat you much nicer [laughter]|user:and	when you have a balance you pay it and	1
user:everything was put on that they didn't care what was put on there just|user:corporate card with American Express with my company and|user:right when i work that's the way we uh i had a	and i i usually	0

agent:[laughter-right]|user:but he said it was the most reliable car he ever had purchased|agent:wow	and he has bought nothing	0
user:the American made cars are becoming reli[able]- reliable but|user:is trying to tell convince me that um|user:i have a cou[sin]- yeah one of my cousins	uh i'm not i'm not sure i just i know for example that both my Corolla and Tercel have been very good	1
user:um|agent:[noise] so what are your favorite shows|user:[noise] okay_1	i like watching Colombo and	0
agent:have you seen the movie|agent:really yeah we like it too|user:i also like to watch Star Trek but it's on so late here that i don't always get to see it [laughter]	uh i haven't seen any of the movies [laughter] because_1 i just barely just like in the last year or so got interested in it and they're	0
agent:it's not really like a soap opera but|agent:not really|agent:no it's	oh i think	0
agent:you know what i'm saying|user:um d[id]-|agent:well the it seems they always show Colombo the same ones over and over though	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:they keep showing them_1 over and over|agent:four or five different ones and then and|agent:or what but it seems like there's only about	oh i guess i've i haven't seen it before	1
agent:now i used to watch Twin Peaks|agent:something i watch on Saturdays and i can't remember what it is|agent:what is it that there's something i watch	oh	1
agent:all right well i as i say i work for a telecommunications company in Plano|user:go ahead [vocalized-noise]	uh-huh	1
agent:wait a minute now they raised the [laughter-deduc[tible]-] they raised the deductible [vocalized-noise]|user:oh really lowered it to what|user:how	yeah [laughter]	1
agent:yeah that's pretty steep|user:uh-huh|agent:for the for the employee	yeah it is but that's something i can live with you know if that's if that's what they want to stop at	1
agent:oh okay|user:i know our our company underwrites our own insurance|agent:[noise]	which in a way i think it it could be a little bad but	0
user:uh-huh|agent:in fact they're using a company down there in Austin 401K management company to administer the pro[gram]- it switched to them over the well last month|user:yeah i've heard of that 401K used as a retirement program before	uh-huh	1
agent:but i'll probably go back to buying them_1 because i don't care to lease them_1 [laughter]|agent:and i leased it on a twenty four month program it's the first time i've ever done that|agent:you know uh this last one i leased so i don't know	did this car have one of these expanding balloons or just are there normal safety belts in it that you had	1
user:well i'm relatively fortunate about that uh|agent:[laughter] my golly how about_1 you Larry|user:i would think so [laughter-that] doesn't sound like you've got very good luck with that one	here we somehow don't have many people run into us although at the beginning of each school season	0
user:and i drive a Honda most of the time and i have to make sure that uh|user:seventy seven Pontiac so forth and i have to uh|user:uh i have a sixty nine Cougar and a	salt and so forth are	0
user:that one that you had the Lincoln|user:well that's an awfully big one that uh|agent:so but last couple cars i've only driven for two years so i'd leased this one for two years so i'll probably go back and buy one and uh this next car -[wi]ll probably be my retirement car	uh isn't it too large for normal town driving	1
agent:been much in such good shape that'll probably be an eight or ten year car|agent:doesn't even have thirty mil[es]- thirty thousand miles on it so gosh|agent:soon to be four years old it only has	um-hum	1
user:uh-huh|agent:it could be any time of the day and and what happens is is they'll call es[pecially]- especially those computer ones|agent:[noise]	uh-huh	1
agent:to your life you know you|agent:uh regular type questions but really they are kind of prying into your|agent:you know you think it's just	um-hum	1
agent:credit application with with us and and sometimes i feel very uncomfortable in in doing that|user:um-hum um-hum|agent:that's always the first thing that i ask you know is about their credit and you know would they have to fill out a little	really	1
agent:yeah most of them_1 are yeah most of them_1 are but they're not all you know they're not done all at the same time|user:but most of them are checked on routinely just by someone else|agent:leisure time uh will check on those credit references but	uh-huh	1
user:i see we used to get the American Express card and|user:i see|agent:so the times of the year that he rents a car more than pays the twenty dollar annual fee for having a gold card	stuff like that and then we just kind of got back to plain old MasterCard and Visa uh because we never really had any	0
user:so|agent:uh-huh|agent:yeah	they're wonderful i mean i think credit cards are great we use it to get cash uh you know you can use it now in the Safeway out here in San Francisco and	1
agent:yeah we do too [laughter]|agent:yeah|user:it'd be great to know we didn't have to pay five hundred dollars or whatever [noise] um on the cards we look for the low rate we have USAA cards uh you know USAA	yeah but but USAA is Dallas based and uh	1
user:but uh|agent:yeah|user:yeah you know enough for a phone call and that's about all	other than that that's the that's the way i use them i know some people that uses them so bad that	0
agent:oh yeah|user:yeah well i think it's better to use credit cards too like i say because y[ou]- there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket|user:uh-huh	they're going to hit you over the head	1
agent:yeah sure i mean it's just a precaution for everybody|user:so i don't think that's right i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches you know|user:you know	uh-huh uh-huh	1
agent:and they give you a half percent of that and that adds up to you know two fifty or something|user:uh-huh|agent:but when you you know when you add up everything you've you've charged up on the Discover card for a year	oh i see	1
agent:oh|user:my parents live in Seattle Washington however all of my mom's and relatives and family are from|user:[noise] my	Utah	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:oh|user:they rent out this cabin that's up on a mountain i mean you have to go up into the hills to get s[ome]- the cooler temperatures and have a enjoyable time	and that's what we usually do and then have of course the food is one of the highlights also	1
agent:yeah|user:and usually have you know something like a talent show or|user:for for each for my father's side and for my mother's side i know and my wife also um so they try when they have family reunions they don't have them as regularly but when they do they try and make [vocalized-noise] big deal out of it	um each family	0
agent:and uh it really is nice when you when because you can get on one tape you can get [laughter-about] thirty or forty old reels you know|agent:uh there's places now that do that|agent:tape a few years ago	uh-huh	1

agent:yes that's true|user:and if it's uh financially if they can do that that's that's great|agent:um-hum	but th[ey]- they need to know about the the costs and uh how they're going to be able to pay for this whether they can get students loans or [noise] are their parents are able to help or whatever but uh [noise] uh the bottom line is uh the the college or university that's gonna give them the best training prepare them for life	1
user:crime um impact would|user:it's it's hard to know actually whether the|agent:i haven't either	be better or wou[ld]- would decrease or would increase if there were	0
agent:you know being on the defensive|user:right|agent:with your keys out being prepared	right looking less like a victim	1

user:i[t's]- it's um|user:oh|user:um that's	uh just in this general area it serves maybe twenty thousand people	0
user:or sources|agent:i you know i assume that the major sources are cars and factories but i|user:yeah one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from	that's what i would think	1
user:but i don't know if that affects outside|agent:yeah|user:people are getting sick	you know i- i think seems to think	0
user:yeah|agent:we've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment|user:yeah	i think something too that you probably see in older states all we we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell	0
user:but we're even getting it here we can drive into when we've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas and you can tell it in the mornings too my husband likes to go out and jog and|user:it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts|user:but i know in Colorado i have witnessed that where it just uh	there's just a brown fog here and we don't even have any mountains that are	0
agent:uh in this country uh whether people are willing to get out of their cars and i[n]- in this country uh the the solution that that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable for example taxing people heavily for using their cars|user:um-hum|agent:big structural change in the economy	yeah	1
user:uh we used to live in California and although we were not in the|agent:yeah|user:yeah i guess so and it's still a little bit flat around here and there's no specific mountains to hem it in	smoggy area of Los Angeles we used to visit down there and honestly you could	0
user:yeah|agent:uh and it really just like making and stuff just hang over whatever cities happen to be on the coast|user:um-hum	[noise] i- i do think that's what's one of the real problems although i grew up in New York and	0
agent:well they have no they have no pollution controls whatsoever|agent:yeah|user:is that right well what are they doing down there that causes such a thing what kind of industries do they have	i see	1
agent:which you know [vocalized-noise] that's [vocalized-noise] kind of going to be the end result you know Bu[sh]- i was reading in the Wall Street Journal today you know Bush's moratorium on regulatory|user:um-hum yeah uh-huh|user:profits i guess	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|agent:not any profit driven industry because you know they're just absolutely not going to you know sit still for anything that's going to take away from profits i mean we're we're living in the greed generation here|agent:absolutely not	um-hum	1
user:um-hum um-hum|user:um-hum|agent:because uh you know it's it's really apparent to me especially living in a city the size of Dallas that the wide open spaces that where always the justification for why worry	um	1
user:and my phone is making a weird noise|user:buy them_1 more often [noise] uh|user:you know so you have to	um	1

agent:right|user:to adequately understand|user:i was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury	what was being presented so that they themselves could make	0

user:that they should be uh|user:if they murder someone in cold uh in cold blood they know what they're doing and uh|user:i i have i've always felt that uh	pay made to pay for it but if we don't have a deterrent of some kind then it just gets to the point where	1
user:uh|user:they were actually caught and they|user:[noise] where it's so clear cut we've had a couple cases here where	and they had witnesses where they had killed two or three people	0
agent:yeah you know i don't in other countries i don't think they do that if someone does something bad like that they just|user:it's really a sad thing especially for the families of those that were involved|user:it's uh	uh-huh	1
agent:so it's the same thing you know but uh i just don't think that they should let it go on and on and on like they do|user:that's true|user:uh	well i know made in the point you made about the taxpayer paying for it when you start considering the	0

agent:that's true if there were enough opportunities|user:that might be more motivating um in relation to what you just mentioned|user:or in in an environment that's related to that field and	if it were somehow of interest to them	1
user:i think contribute to a person's responsibility and and sense of|user:to do something of a volunteer nature maybe in another country but that that's difficult for a lot of people i guess financially to to manage but it would certainly|user:i really like the idea of young people getting a chance to	maturity um to recognize what other cultures and	1
user:[noise]|user:[noise]|agent:so i- i definitely agree that it's it's good i just you know i[t]- i- i to to require it i think would take a lot of forethought and planning if you wanna get the type of service you know that you're anticipating that you're hoping for	yes	1
user:um-hum|user:um-hum|user:yes	i- i think it's terrific to have criminals involved in community services	0
agent:like if you like y[ou]-|user:i believe you do yeah you have to volunteer in a department that that provides occupational therapy or physical therapy if that's the the area you're pursuing|agent:so you have to do it in that field actually	i'm sure that there are other reasons for them wanting people to do that because	0

agent:um-hum well they have a lot of they i don't know they have a lot of different different kinds of ads and stuff in them_1|user:that's great though because_1 especially with business though because_1 i know like with business stuff because_1 when they first asked me this i was like well Go[d]- i they're like why do you like articles or or why do you not like magazines i was like [laughter-because_1] [laughter-it] [laughter-has] so many advertising but business ones don't really|agent:well there's more that i could get	and they're really informative	1
user:i guess i've just begun to take that for advantage that buttons are not gonna be sewn on i mean took that for uh granted|agent:and um|user:yeah [noise] it's in[teresting]- it's interesting i really hadn't even given any thought at all to things like buttons and seams but	that buttons are not gonna be sewn on very well	1

user:[noise]|agent:[noise] okay what are you are you doing anything in Utah on recycling	well in uh our particular area uh we're not other than uh	0
user:yes so that's uh|user:um-hum|agent:the problem that i'm finding is that uh a lot of the places i've been taking things have now discontinued the recycling policy like it's hard to find a place to take newspapers anymore	that's basically what happened up here and then uh with all the recycling the price of aluminum cans went down	1
user:uh receptacles where they put it in|user:they pick it up they have a [noise] a recycling uh garbage uh pick up where they have different|user:but i have a son in Illinois who uh	they have some for the cans some for the bottles and newspapers	0
agent:um-hum|user:the material in the dumps is newspapers|user:well i've that's what they in the l[ocal]- the local paper here they were talking about that uh half about half the uh	they could recycle that uh more than they do then uh	0
agent:well and i know uh too my mother lives in a rural area also and it she would have to go like thirty miles to recycle anything and s[o]- c[ourse]- so of course sh[e]- she doesn't and plus|user:and uh|agent:uh-huh	um	1
user:uh south of us about a hundred miles south in Utah they do have a uh area where|user:all over to do it now i know in|user:yeah i[t]- it really does if we could just get uh people uh	uh they bring all the garbage in and they uh they do have places to recycle and they really encourage this and uh you can bring it and you have different areas	1
agent:yes yes|user:isn't it a pain to look for cars|agent:yes and so uh i've actually been looking around and then then things got too busy and it's too complicated out there so	i i hate it	0
user:in[surance]- insurance yeah and|user:i understand that uh i i do i understand that|user:uh-huh	right right well i've i really have uh you know like i say i i feel like i have made a commitment now to drive the car that i've got which	0

user:piece that had no rhythm|user:and then there was this very modern day|agent:uh-huh	no tune and just sounded like a bunch of racket	0
user:but uh [noise] i like comedies the o[ther]- the other show that i like is kind of silly a lot of it but uh|user:i didn't watch it for the first season then a friend of mine d[id]- had commented how good it was and i started watching it it's just a hoot|user:but uh	America's [Hunniest/Funniest] [Fo[me]-/Home] Home Video	0
agent:yes do you find you learn a lot on those shows|user:so tha[t's]- that's interesting to me|user:uh clever people who know just a a vast amount of trivial information	[noise] yeah i do as a matter of fact they had one not too long ago and one of the questions was what is the most populous country	0
user:uh give any information on how to compete they do say that if you're going to be in the Los Angeles area|user:occasionally about it the interesting thing about Jeopardy is that they never do uh|user:you know probably thinks uh	and want free tickets they tell you how to get that	0
agent:[laughter]|user:yeah well anyway i i k[ind]- i kind of get a kick out of that one just because uh i like the uh the the husband on there he's always trying to put more power into all the electrical appliances|agent:second time	bu[t]- but uh then after that Roseanne comes on which i have uh friends who just	0
user:that that's the case or the problem i have i'm getting older and uh the wife and uh we|agent:everything seems to go [laughter-up]|user:that's true that	use the doctors more have um more health problems and that is a very important benefit that uh	1
agent:yeah one illness -[w]ill do it|user:all your savings and everything one one serious illness|user:it could wipe a a family out or uh	i think that's uh one of the benefits that we really need to	0
user:ho[lidays]- holidays so many people are losing their jobs and uh|user:this uh|user:because of changes in Europe	i don't know how you can a[s]- as a benefit how you could h[ave]- have security as one but most people like to have that security in their jobs	1
user:good|agent:helped us through it|user:good	good a good thing that uh they she had those	0
agent:yes|user:they have|user:and another one i think is uh quite important of course is retirement system that they	and uh with social security and uh the way it is if that's all you got is social security	0
user:[noise]|agent:i think the elderly needs it more than anything|user:yes	that's true and uh it seems like it goes up every year you have no control over the the cost to you	1
user:uh i- i hope that this plan that uh the President's come up with uh|user:but still|agent:[laughter-no]	is gonna help all those or help some way	0
user:i- i- i think that the last uh part of that question was particularly interesting um [noise] about um|user:yeah|agent:i mean that's what i would like to think	uh uh can all unethical behavior or how much unethical behavior can be made	0
user:um|agent:because_1 you p[ry]- start prying in people's private lives you ruin their lives as well as|agent:yeah yeah that makes sense	that's right	1
user:um so a[nd]- and and and as far as um [noise] you know myself having any particular personal|agent:um-hum um-hum|agent:um um-hum	uh knowledge or insight into	0
agent:um-hum|agent:right|user:their judgment and their insight	but the media insight as you said i just kind of read and	0
agent:i don't see a lot of change happening [laughter]|user:[noise]|user:[noise]	attorneys yeah	0
agent:everybody decides them with this the constituency in mind or or afraid that they're gonna hack off the wrong group or the other vote wise|agent:uh and rather than really honestly decide issues on the basis of what is good for the country|agent:of some kind or maybe several	um-hum	1
user:[noise] the benefits legislatures uh state and senate and uh|user:yeah|user:uh you seen the benefits that	and legislatures in [Warshin/Washington] get after they've been there a few terms is unbelievable	0
agent:yep|user:[laughter] [noise] well th[ey]- they used to say in advertising that the textbook example of good competitive adver[tising]- advertising is Hertz and Avis rent a car commercials number one number two|user:[noise]	i guess LBJ has to be a textbook example of politician without any morals	1
user:well i like Reader's Digest we get that and my husband subscribes to Scientific American|agent:what other kind of magazines do you like|agent:um i haven't gotten any magazines that have shown me anything lately	i think he's a frustrated doctor	1
user:what's the other one|user:uh|user:Scientific American and um	i think it's Ladies' Home Journal or Redbook something like that	1
agent:the fragrance is just there it's like a fold that's glued shut|agent:th[e]- well the ones aren't they're not scratch and sniff anymore the the o[ne]- kind i'm talking about you open it up and|user:with the scratch and sniffs	oh	1
agent:sometimes the book excerpts are good too but mostly i like the other articles|agent:in the anecdotes and the jokes and things on those|agent:but i like the they're interesting and plus i like to read through the	yeah	1
user:well i really feel in some areas that uh i agree i don't think any of us like paying taxes i think in some areas|agent:what do you think|user:right	we could do better in a private sector	1
agent:yeah it's needed|user:but i think because there's so many people without insurance that's what's c[oming]- you know it's coming|user:and uh we get you know gets forced into it i think socialized medicine's coming which i hate to see	uh-huh	1
agent:you know forty thousand dollars a year you're paying ten thousand in dollars a year in taxes and everybody who's in that type of income is paying that|user:yeah|agent:so five hundred dollars every two weeks comes out you know and obviously if you make	yeah	1
agent:w[hat]-|agent:[noise]|user:no i don't know i don't know what the answer is to all this i think uh	i don't know	1
agent:[noise]	[noise] i'm i'm ready [laughter]	1
user:with their family|user:i think they would be better off being at home|user:if i did have a mother living i don't think i could do that	you know	1
user:um-hum|agent:and i think that would make it very hard but on the other hand i see my wife with i guess our youngest one now is five|agent:and i think she'd really resent it	oh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:as opposed to considering her current circumstances and|user:uh-huh uh-huh	but the cost of these nursing homes are so	1
agent:and she could be around some elderly people and have some activities would be of more interest to her|user:yeah then bring her back home at night|agent:that's more readily available you know i think if we could send her someplace for the day	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:with the graying of America we're really going to have to as a as a country figure out how we're going to deal with this|agent:but i think it's an issue that you know|user:hm	um-hum	1
user:uh luckily i mean she lived by herself and then you know one day she had a heart attack and|user:had to be like that and|user:well uh my mother always said she hopes she never	she was gone so she never did have to go into a nursing home or anything like that but there's	0
agent:his drug problems|user:uh-huh|agent:actually i used to and i gave it up this year because i thought well Roy Tarpley wasn't going to make it and sure enough about a week after i decided not to buy my ticket he went down with his uh	huh	1

agent:yeah [laughter]|user:keep kids in class and|user:and that's not a good learning situation if you've got to have policemen there to	so it sound like that's it's kind of getting to that point in Texas in at least where you're at	1
user:off the wall classes that have nothing to do with academic e[ducation]-|user:and i think that is that's a good change to to get back instead of so many uh|user:a lot of the academic classes that uh they feel is necessary	you know education	1
agent:um-hum|user:[noise] we have a a there's a little of that going on here but it's all in the elementary grades it's not in the upper uh|agent:they go for three months and then take a month off or some[thing]-	in the secondary area	0

agent:uh-huh|user:it is amazing how fast you take off the inches|agent:but um so how how successful is your exercise video	and i would once i start my forty i'd like to do the forty five minutes a day on the bike for a week and then every other day i'd like to incorporate the video	1
agent:so it's a good workout|user:and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video and it's a hour long video|agent:um-hum	so	0
agent:i read the news sometimes and that's kind of helpful|user:um-hum|user:right	i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things you keep up on what's going on	1
agent:yeah exactly|user:you know kind of publicize his name|agent:yeah	i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on	1
agent:i don't really subscribe to anything else|user:i|agent:but other than that i don't really r[ead]- i don't	i used to read every month a Reader's Digest	0
agent:they're in you know tr[aining]- spring training or whatever and they did so well last year|agent:also big in big in the news right now is the Braves because they're uh|agent:i guess people want to hear about it	right right	0
user:it's rare to find someone who will|user:it's my impression that uh|agent:in the past nobody picked up	recycle magazines	1
agent:much more exorbitant rates than the uh than the volunteer you know you you pay to have your magazines recycled that kind of thing|user:you take advantage of it or not|agent:they charge	uh-huh	1
user:uh and i believe they don't pick up the plastic i think it's the two categories you talked about it's just newspapers|user:they do not pick up magazines|user:and uh picks up recyclables	bottles cans	1
user:i don't not sure if anybody really sent donations in to this private company|user:i'm|user:and i	just to be nice and i believe they're going to start charging now	1
user:this is another this is uh|agent:oh i see what you're saying|user:right we pay for our trash pickup but this isn't the trash people	um	0
agent:that uh with the volume of recyclables coming in|agent:the thing that that uh has another thing that's been in the press here has been|user:so it's uh	um-hum	1
user:yeah i- i [noise] i agree that you know capital punishment is bad but just more for the econ[omic]- for economic reasons because i- i don't think it acts as a deterrent|user:[noise] yeah definitely|user:um-hum	[noise] and i don't think that	0
user:is he prose[cution]-|agent:down in Tennessee he's a he's an attorney he represents people on death row|agent:which happens a lot a friend of mine uh does that type of work down in uh	oh he's he's a he's for the defendant okay [noise]	1
user:um [noise] yeah i'm not sure how often we how often this actually it seems like about once a year they execute someone|agent:yeah they|user:[noise] yeah they do	i don't really [laughter-keep] you know i don't really keep up after when the last one was	1
user:you know|agent:yeah in Tennessee so it puts a lot of pressure on them_1 [laughter-yeah]|user:in Tennessee	one thing that i've always that i've	0
agent:yeah sure|user:and you know where they've actually you know spent you know thousands of dollars reviving them you know just to kill them [laughter]|user:you know someone tries to kill themselves in prison you know and when they're you know on death row and	and that always that always seemed to be you know some sort of	1
agent:um-hum|user:uh you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted|user:you uh would have a problem	have you ever served on a jury before	1
agent:but it then became unanimous so|user:ah|user:yeah	oh	0
user:yeah i mean i i really i would like to uh to do it at some point um|agent:yeah well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though|user:declined it which i'm able to do because i'm a student because it was uh a very bad time	but uh i- i haven't	0
agent:turn out the way it should have so|agent:yeah they well they picked the one person and then he finally you know moderated everything and made it|user:hum that's interesting did it did it work out pretty well in the end i mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial or	so it worked it did end up working out pretty well	1
user:uh whatever|user:if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about|user:if there's really um	um you know issue is under discussion	1
user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	uh Greg uh i'm i'm not familiar i think uh you guys in Indiana don't you have the the death penalty	1
agent:right|user:of course at that time you know i thought uh ho[w]- it's it was stupid to kill anybody for uh you know that the eye for an eye was a stupid argument|user:and uh	but [noise] the uh	0
user:from society and i think i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because uh really any kind of uh|agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh	uh jail sentence for them is just another chance to uh create another power structure [laughter] you know the	1
user:do you uh are there cases where you think that that uh the capital [vocalized-noise] capital punishment shouldn't be uh|user:uh [noise]|user:[vocalized-noise]	uh sentenced	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah|agent:um-hum	[noise] [noise] so uh that was a curious case i	1
agent:been voting for years and i couldn't figure out why i hadn't been called yet|agent:[noise] yeah i finally served on one last year i've um|user:which is very similar to a jury a lot of the same rules apply have you ever served on one	uh-huh	1
agent:mix for their case so they ask all kinds of wild questions|agent:whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like you know they want to get the best uh|user:no	that	1
user:right|agent:uh i didn't like not being able to deliberate and uh i uh i- i wanted to vote guilty for the guy and the other people were kind of mixed|agent:i didn't uh	uh-huh	1
user:getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case|user:i know on a|agent:um	it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous it's s[imple]- a simple majority you know rules	1
agent:what we're allotted|agent:just spend what [noise] the amount in each column|agent:and i put so much in each one and then just subtract of	uh-huh so you pretty much keep pretty close to your budget	1
agent:we've [vocalized-noise] gone to the house but sometimes you dip into it|agent:and that was tough to get we try to not touch that|agent:that we keep	yeah	1
agent:liquor distiller|user:[noise]|user:oh i work for a liquor uh distiller	yeah and they're moving their offices u[p]- offices up to Connecticut	1
user:yeah well i wanna try to um|agent:looking for part-time work just to try off to pay off her car|agent:we have one dog [laughter] but it's good we[ll]- she['s]-	[noise]	0
agent:same thing|agent:the air bags yeah|user:automotive safety bags is that like air bags	-[a]nother term [noise] well i guess [noise] i covered all the budgeting that i wanted to [laughter]	1
agent:i see how much how much do they charge|user:really don't really have any problem with finding day care for him because i'm in the service and we just take him to the day care on base|user:and we uh	they charge about forty five dollars a week	1
agent:select whatever services they wanted for their child rather than to have the government subsidize certain providers|agent:and i came out uh very much in favor of a tax credit approach where parents would be given a tax credit and they would|user:yeah	yeah	1
agent:s[o]- s[o]- so what do you think about the about the child about the tax credit versus the subsidy approach which s[eems]- seems most appealing to you|user:you know it it worked out pretty good|user:so	uh	1
user:um-hum um-hum|agent:it needs to be done you know|agent:first just even deciding to do it and then i think feeling guilty after you know that	uh yeah i had a a good friend who just did it and and my boss too [laughter]	0
user:the nurses now i don't know that it would have been any better in a nursing home|user:and she was able to stay in her apartment but the but the cost of that was unbelievable to have|agent:um-hum	but at that point	1
user:you know that's really hard and i don't know what you know what the different things that you would look for i|user:right exactly and if the and and yet if the care is just is just so hard then that's|user:right right	mean obviously uh	0
agent:and has been independent all their lives and then all of a sudden you know|user:it doesn't feel i would think that would be easier than someone who really does know and is saying i d[on't]-|agent:um-hum	exactly	1
user:yeah|user:um-hum|agent:and would be easier for them to get out and to see those people i guess	but but it's just that	1
agent:i'm into recycling i've got several friends who use me as their recycling drop off matter of fact|user:you're you're into uh recycling|agent:yes i am	um-hum what materials do you recycle	1
agent:was going to just put it in the landfill i mean i could have done that|agent:i would really be disturbed if i found out that the place i took it to|agent:waiting for a recycling place to take it to and	well i think	0
agent:i mean like the the green and white barred|user:and|agent:oh uh-huh but do they recycle computer paper	uh	1
agent:quite a few of the children are in baby food|agent:we contribute quite a bit of glass we all have children and|agent:although with my friends helping we	um-hum	1

agent:i'm not quite at that point in my life [laughter-yet] so|agent:i'm uh|user:yeah	yeah well yeah	1
user:paying too much if i'm sure that i'm getting value for the dollar i mean that|user:middle income tax payer i'm not|user:as a	i guess sounds like a cliche but	0
user:seems to be concerned with just that you know who's who's gonna start getting more and how fast|user:in terms of of tax reform or or revenue reallocation|user:dozen years or so or maybe even longer	um i kind of came of age in the	0
user:yeah i i've never been able to reconcile that fact which which does seem to be true with the fact that|agent:and we weren't a debtor nation in those days|agent:i was just going to say there's significantly more money uh	the typical	0
agent:borrowing money to go on a vacation because you have all year long to think about those payments and|agent:when i was growing up they always warned me against|agent:[noise] where the pay later is uh is here and [noise] and uh	[laughter]	1
agent:and it seemed like that uh plastic would would would've been very helpful to recycle well finally they started plastics but only the kind of milk bottle plastics|user:um-hum|agent:really wasn't a lot that i could put in there anyway i just mostly had bottles um	yeah	1
agent:yeah that would that would be good because_1 uh you know|user:um-hum|user:hm	yeah yeah that seems like it would be you know very labor intensive to actually you know go through it all and	0
user:[noise] their you know the the the the|agent:hm|user:because you know everyone's become much more environmentally conscious and you know has moved to recycle that	the systems basically has this very large backlog of of material to be recycled and	0
agent:and i think some of the plastics are are are are among those that's rather difficult to re[cycle]- it's just to recycle them there needs to be a greater economies of scale before they become uh viable|user:um|agent:and i believe clear glass is one there is plenty of market for they can use all they can get but it's other things	um-hum	0
agent:nah not really my parents are still pretty young my father's forty five mother about the same age|user:nursing homes and the elderly that sort of thing in your own life|user:[noise] so have you had to think about uh	uh-huh	1

agent:yeah it seems that way|agent:yeah|user:put away enough money to handle it ourselves	huh um	0
agent:right|user:i mean it seems like in a case like that you'd need more help than ever to uh|user:yeah	to more more support and some way to live a fulfilling life and it doesn't seem like those people are getting it	1
agent:um-hum|agent:right|user:things that people are put through the so heroic measures they're put through when they're very sick some of them are very old and some aren't that uh	everyone	0

user:but|agent:yeah|user:is holding up a bank and shoots somebody effects a fairly small circle of people i mean the relatives and friends of the person that was killed	but a drug dealer a major drug dealer is effecting what thousands of lives	1

agent:yeah really it's one of those things that you read once and then if you if you're not worried about it you just forget [laughter-about] [laughter-it] [laughter]|user:i think our policy is that all right it's probably the same thing i'm not really sure becau[se]- [laughter-anyway]|user:huh that's	[laughter-i] [laughter-don't] [laughter-have] [laughter-the]	1
agent:you know equipment machinery and stuff|agent:yeah [vocalized-noise] especially around uh|user:that'd be just as dangerous	huh	1
agent:thing for a company to say and i personally i don't think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body|agent:you know worthy of working for us i really don't see that that's a very very valid uh|agent:um i don't really [noise] think that it's uh too many i think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say well we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're uh	yeah uh i guess i basically agree that uh do you think it's okay for a company	1
agent:right|user:if you're gonna treat me with this much respect even before|agent:yeah	you've gotten to know me	1
user:hum|agent:it should it's kind of the big brother syndrome [laughter] i mean i just|agent:and other than that i think i do not think it should be allowable i think it should be illegal for them to to want to do that	[noise]	1

agent:yeah|user:starting up a little preschool|user:it sounds like we'll be doing something similar and my wife was thinking of uh	maybe just with a few other mothers	0
user:uh-huh|agent:uh she was in college actually when the baby was born|user:now the twenty four year old was was nineteen when the five year old was born has she been at home	what kind of what's their relationship like	1

agent:we're into the grand type child period now that's much better|user:um|agent:now we've	oh yeah i would think that would have a lot of rewards does your does your daughter live nearby	1
user:but it is nice to i mean i- i find it|user:um|user:[laughter]	it really gives me peace of mind to know that my wife is home	0
user:i go to a gym and|user:just probably in the last four or five months i've been able to pick up um|user:i know um	and uh ride the bike and do the what's called the stair master	1
user:so but before that i did|user:uh last five six months|user:at least for the last	uh i did biking i like to swim a lot too	1
user:and i don't i don't know|user:i just didn't feel like it was doing much for me|user:i- i didn't	if i wasn't doing it properly or what but	1
agent:this job just involves sitting in in front of a keyboard all day long writing computer programs|agent:uh|agent:i don't know about you but uh	ah	1
user:um|user:but now it's you know i don't like to wake up but once i'm up i enjoy it an[d]- i an[d]- and i enjoy the the challenge of seeing how much further i can get and|user:really worked out but i- i really have you know first going to the gym was really really tough and i've been doing it like early in the mornings before the kids wake up so	right now i'm	0
user:biked and how many calories it's burned|user:uh levels that you can um ride on or walk on and it tells you you know how far you've walked or how far you've um|user:you have	and you can set it up where	0
agent:yeah [noise]|user:[noise] good way for companies to weed out people with drug problems but|user:uh screening for potential problems	since then i've been hearing uh	1
user:employee turnover health problems and accidents and theft and i understand that certain jobs like if you're driving a train or|user:reduce some tremendous problems they've had with|user:i know some employers have had have been able to uh	plane or something of course there'd be increased need for it	1
user:other ones are|user:so it seems kind of too bad that that one's tolerated while|agent:[noise]	are of you know are the ones that they focus on	1
agent:yeah good old boy stuff [laughter] you know well this is yeah this is natural this is tell me what do you expect [laughter]|agent:the good old [noise]|user:you know a an attorney knows they get in front of a jury and the jury will be thinking well i've done that before or he's just a good old boy [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter]	[laughter]	1
agent:uh yes i'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts|user:okay Bill have you done much camping|agent:yes	ah ha	1

agent:uh do they cook on stoves|agent:what uh what kind of camping do they like best do they like it where they have tents and|user:so	um	0
agent:so lots of times we don't even take tents|user:[laughter]|agent:it doesn't get very cold in Texas	oh is that right	1
agent:um-hum|user:i like to sleep on the mattresses|user:i like to sleep on the air mattresses i d[on't]- am not [laughter] my bones are getting so old so i like to	um	1
user:oh uh|agent:because uh we have uh armadillos do you know what a armadillo is|user:oh	they're covered with like a heavy armor	0
EMPTY	[noise]	0
agent:you know overall i'm satisfied with it we don't have the vision care we do have the health care and the uh and the medi[cal]- or the dental|agent:our benefits package isn't uh isn't quite as good in in some ways uh|user:oh	um-hum	1
agent:uh-huh|user:but here you don't get that you maybe get two or three a year|agent:right	so it's really unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever um	0
user:toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing|agent:right|agent:uh-huh	it's kind of an interesting plan it's kind of cold though they've essentially made up a list of uh	1
agent:um-hum|user:historically a lot of companies i think carried dental as a rider along with the medical|user:and i know	but i'm not sure that's that's widely followed any more	0
agent:uh for the operating staff it's on a seniority it's uh you know based on how long they've worked there|user:oh okay|agent:the main difference is in the uh the way sick time is accrued and and vacation time is accrued	right	1
agent:oh i forgot my i i had to dig through my suitcase and find my personal identification number [laughter]|user:yeah|agent:did you have to wait very long	[laughter-okay]	1
agent:kind of an impression of their system which is socialistic|agent:yeah yeah i wa[s]- so when i was living in Sweden i got uh an im[pression]-|user:but you worked over there for a couple of year	yes	1
user:for uh you know through uh red tape through|agent:i can go|user:right or if if things i didn't feel that things were wasted	waste	0
user:uh kind of leech off the system|user:so to eliminate people who continuously|user:if he's president if you don't get a job within two years then you're taken off welfare	you know you you have you get to spend your time but then you're off	1
agent:that'd be quite an exciting battle|agent:and to see how Congress reacts to that|user:yes	yeah	1
user:uh Grady Hospital where a lot of|user:i pay for a a local hospital|user:um	indigent people are go and get free care	0
user:uh-huh|agent:a reasonable doubt that they had committed a a crime worthy of it then i think it should be done|agent:uh evidence uh beyond a	and that way it can be a d[eterrent]- a deterrent	1
agent:the the problem that i see is uh what do we have instead|user:[laughter]|agent:that uh i'm almost inclined to say do away with it	uh-huh	1
user:there are people that are going to make sure that every|user:well i don't tend to agree with i definitely agree with you that|user:however i tend to agree with you that	T is crossed every I is dotted and to make sure that everything is just right otherwise you know someone gets off on a technicality	0
user:in typically what i believe is an open and shut case where the guy is guilty there are seven eyewitnesses they saw it happen they have testified what happened|user:bending over backwards uh|user:they're they're	um	0
user:[noise]|agent:[noise] think about what nursing home	well [noise] my parents were both in them_1	0
agent:uh go into a nursing home|agent:people just go down hill when they|user:right	yeah	1
user:whereas it's you know usually pretty good|agent:yeah|user:just because they don't like it in there	uh [noise]	0
user:and they just had a|agent:oh yeah|user:well you have to make sure they're clean	incident in uh	0
user:yeah|agent:uh oh|agent:[noise]	so	0
agent:yeah it is uh one of the ladies my grandmother has is apparently|user:is ever ending|agent:yeah	[noise]	1
agent:for me it's uh i mean like medical and you know uh benefits and dental|agent:and plus|user:uh-huh	okay	1
agent:are they like we[ll]- pretty much trained for a specific job and that what's their hired for and then uh|user:uh like|agent:um	really [vocalized-noise]	1
user:and i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution|agent:um-hum|user:uh it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance	perhaps somewhat even with the business	0
agent:um-hum|user:institutions and the corporate world in|user:uh so i i think there it's probably a major distinction between	uh institutions are slower to	0
agent:yeah but so what else do you think is important|agent:um-hum|agent:yeah	well [noise]	1
user:uh i guess in innovation although|user:but if you're in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for|agent:um-hum	he the you know the more complex your structure	1
user:yeah|agent:get accomplished you know|agent:whereas yeah in a smaller i think you'd be more willing to either help that person or help it	yeah it becomes the organization instead of	1
agent:yes okay you know where Dallas is|user:i see okay well anyway it doesn't hail from the area where you are|user:[noise]	uh but uh	0
user:how you stand compared to last year [noise]|user:if you if you can just print it out it gives you a lot better feel for|agent:right	um	1
user:it took about three screens to do that|user:change a transaction let's say you wanted to add in interest or put in a fee or something|user:you would make one [vocalized-noise] uh like for example if you were reconciling your check account and you wanted to	and you could only see the one transaction you were working on	0
agent:home owner's is due and when the car insurance is due and such like that and he just|agent:of course he knows ahead of time about when the uh|user:[vocalized-noise]	right	1
user:but they say [laughter] i- uh they always forget you [laughter] every year they mess it up and forget to give me credit or or or shall i say five out of the last six years|agent:well that's nice|user:you get a discount for doing that they give you the thirteenth month of month of service free if they remember [laughter]	so i called in and uh at first i got kind of upset but [laughter] [laughter-now]	1
agent:and also into a retirement plan|agent:stock plan at his company|agent:a	yeah	1
agent:yeah they say how old is he|user:you know school education and stuff for later on|user:we try to put a little away for his	he's five	1
user:for that because_1 she has to drive about twenty thirty minutes every day to school and that|user:the the uh budget part kind of falls in there you know you get unexpected expenses and stuff|user:and you know	that adds more to	0
agent:you know my husband let's go play some golf you know something like that or let let's run to the mall|agent:in this time and you know i don't know what it is it's well it's|agent:it was just this is what we have and this is what we spend but that's	[laughter]	1
agent:you know doing the sentencing|agent:i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges uh|agent:that's a concern of mine uh	um-hum	1
agent:uh too often i think they're not|user:i'd agree that that's that's definitely a problem|agent:uh	um-hum	1
agent:this is very true|user:gets unequal sentences|user:i think it becomes a lot less th[e]- th[e]- the the same crime	i uh i- i think there is more of an ability of you know	0
agent:uh|user:um-hum|agent:where uh it would appear that the crimes were very similar but one individual got twenty five years and the other one was sentenced to life for some[thing]-	of course a lot of that's also the the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer [laughter]	1
agent:so i don't know [laughter]|agent:the city has dropped their charges against him because their the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge|agent:uh	yeah	1
agent:the right to do what they need to|agent:that's an invasion of your personal privacy that's if they were to decide that you shouldn't be drinking w[ould]- would they just you know i mean y[ou]- you have to draw the line somewhere i think and give people|user:um-hum	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah it does and so i don't know it's kind of a perplexing problem|user:it does feel like it doesn't it|agent:we [laughter] and here we are we're going the other way and	i know	1
user:did people just|user:history ha[ve]- have people checked that or did people just|user:yeah it and it does it does make you wonder because i'm not su[re]- i was trying to think in in	accept the responsibility or are we able to test things now that never could be tested before so therefore we're using technology in a way that	0
user:and uh|agent:uh-huh|user:lethal injection	it's going to take at least all ready this year three have been put to death	1
user:bit then|user:sentenced by a jury of their peers found guilty and then gone through the appeal|user:that once they have been	why continue [noise]	1
agent:now where was that at|user:uh-huh|agent:that that was in the news everywhere	uh	0
user:the police found the child tied and starved|user:they they tied this [laughter-child]|agent:uh-huh	and uh there's no doubt a case like that there's no doubt in my mind	0
user:uh-huh|agent:no i- i certainly think punishment is in order but the death penalty because that's i am not sure that that's homicide because they didn't i i it's it was certainly wasn't intentional homicide|agent:well	Well you may have a point there i	1
user:uh|user:okay so what do you think about uh|user:[noise]	health care for the elderly	1
user:right|agent:and uh and|agent:there was a set of things that she knew she was covered for	that's hundred percent coverage so it's that's good	1
user:it she's not really|user:that's the big question is um what what happens when they begin to get older i have a grandmother and|user:right i guess	uh you know she's getting to the point where she almost can't be in a nursing home	0
user:but uh she's|user:my grandmother is hers is physically she's in not too bad of shape she's in her upper eighties i guess forgetting in my order|user:yeah my uh	uh	0
agent:um-hum i don't think we've had a case uh recently but|user:uh-huh|agent:sorry i said Texas is is for capital punishment	uh-huh	1
user:because she was overturning|agent:um-hum|user:being pounded on in the newspapers	uh	0
user:um|user:i don't to me it seems unnecessary|user:well i	i think that the sort of person who	1
agent:of of being for it|agent:tend to fa[ll]- come down on the side|agent:uh i probably	um-hum	1
user:uh and i would say that uh|agent:um-hum|user:the solution to the problem isn't whether you kill people or not at the end it's what happens before that	you know putting more	1
user:you're executing someone or not rather than the other end of the system where you're turning out a person who's likely to do something like that or not|user:focus more on the one end of the system where|user:i it seems like people uh	uh	0
agent:if you could put them_1 away and be assured that they would stay there|user:um-hum|agent:for you to continue you know and and possibly get out and do it again you know there's too much of	um-hum	1
agent:and nobody wanted to go for that|user:um-hum|user:um-hum	uh-huh	1
agent:destroyed those|user:[laughter]|agent:and that's the bad thing about it and newspapers we we started saving newspapers and stuff well they just packed up and i have cats well they had a field day	now what do they do i have cats too but they don't do anything with newspaper	1
user:well that's funny well i- i|agent:uh-huh so now it's just a big play play time|user:and then they learned how huh	we we do have more facilities than that around here so that we they're they are trying in Dallas to do some	0
agent:oh i know and we take the little plastic bags back to the to the grocery store|user:and and uh there's not that much that makes you feel like you've got any control over anything|agent:that's true	[laughter-so]	1
agent:but i- i- try and we have a lot of of newspapers and magazines and things like that but|user:no [laughter-please] [laughter-no]|agent:exactly they'll say do you want any no i do not	yeah	1
agent:yeah we do yeah but the but the reason the sales tax is high is because we don't have an income tax|user:you have a real high sales tax there if i recall|agent:uh	uh-huh	1
user:uh in terms of you know the per student expenditure|user:the private schools|user:get more funds than	at say Carver High School in Atlanta	0
user:and|agent:well it's cheaper to to educate uh people who are in the top ten percent than it is to have to educate the handicapped and the developmentally disabled and all that stuff|user:doesn't turn out that quality of student	[laughter]	1
user:yeah i think that uh one of the reasons our taxes are so high is just that uh on on top of the inefficiencies like what i just described is|agent:what all the reasons are for that|agent:that that's been going down and uh i don't know what uh	the government tries to do too many things that the government has no business doing you know we're spending	0
user:you know i I one of the questions i asked the representative of Bob Carey who was there was|user:uh|user:and uh	uh	0
user:yeah in New Hampshire we have uh uh no no what we call broad base taxes no|user:uh uh-huh|agent:um yes uh-huh	income tax and no sales tax	0
user:uh we do have a very low tax rate but you know combined with the federal income tax i think that Americans uh|user:so|agent:oh	generally do pay in too too much in taxes [vocalized-noise]	1
agent:yeah|user:you know what i mean|agent:yeah	uh	0
user:it|user:that's|agent:i don't know i'm not you know really into politics i don['t]-	um-hum	1
agent:hm|agent:right|agent:yeah	doesn't seem fair to me	1
agent:uh NBC|user:or what station|user:yeah what what channel do you watch	that's the one i watch i usually keep up with TV i don't i am a student so i really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff	0
agent:i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press you know which only happened like ten times in my life|agent:with the press is that like any any stories that|agent:yeah also also i have the observation with um	huh	1
agent:found it so incredibly watered down and|agent:[noise] read the story and just|agent:newspapers probably aren't as bad as television but i just you know	yeah	1
agent:oh yeah i have seen that happen lots of times you know [vocalized-noise] you know Channel X gives you the best coverage [noise] you know we were on the scene with our team players you know|user:to promote themselves i just thought that was really|agent:um-hum	that's kind of cold	1
agent:you know i mean it just it just seemed to lack any sort of debate|agent:um|user:did you	yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:and you've got to pay for them to pick it up and stuff|user:uh our neighborhood they have a recycling program	and then they get paid for recycling it so [laughter] i don't know	1
agent:the glass and the plastic|agent:and will collect|agent:will pay for aluminum	yeah	1
agent:you know uh you know uh they say all these plastics are recyclable but nobody will take anything on beyond a two|agent:on all sorts of things you know the they the diaper people advertise that diaper are recyclable and they are working on a program to recycle and well yeah in one small community they're recyclable but there is nothing around that will recycle that or recycle tires or recycle|agent:they say	yeah	1
agent:oh we have one rotten cat|agent:[noise]|user:Dave what kind of pets do you have	one rotten cat	1
agent:you know they're usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody|user:uh-huh|agent:but i i've never owned a cat like that i've had cats growing up all the time and	huh that's interesting	1
agent:you feel like [laughter]|user:um yeah right now it it is|agent:so that is that kind of your child right now	it's kind of good training i mean we've been trying for kids but	0
agent:not mutts but mixes you know like one or one or two mix|agent:well not|agent:and we had mostly	um-hum	1
agent:and he was just too big for our kids when we got him|agent:[vocalized-noise] i should say a pup|agent:and	oh yeah	1
user:they have a trial section that uh|user:we are not doing a whole lot here in Arlington about it uh|agent:so	part of the city has been given these uh	1
agent:and it's not the safest neighborhood there is|user:uh-huh|agent:the University of Pennsylvania where i'm a grad student	[laughter]	1
agent:from um a standpoint of making new paper to recycle|agent:to just|agent:right well the only part the thing is that it's probably isn't profitable	um-hum	1
user:but do you all have any place around there for uh|user:oh|agent:down at the ends of the hallways that when they get filled up you can go take them down the hall	used oil car oil	1
user:[laughter]|user:uh|user:trial by jury	uh-huh	1
agent:right|user:or that pandered to my nosiness|user:in a way that kind of satisfied my uh	-[be]cau[se]- it was a civil case and you got to hear every little detail about how these guys had dealt with each other	0
user:uh was it you know what was it and if it was something|agent:uh-huh|user:was it -[w]as it wages was it a loan that needed to be paid back	if if anybody owed anybody any money back how much did they owe	0
user:so maybe|agent:right which|user:i guess i guess all they can do is knock off the people they think would be most biased against them	maybe by knocking off extreme cases on both sides you end up with	1
agent:i mean if they haven't formed some sort of opinion i don't uh i don't know what i'm trying to say really but it just|agent:i guess that's the one thing that i [laughter-would] think is wrong with it i don't know what you'd about it but those people are are not going to be|agent:it just seems like tho[se]-	yeah it would almost be as if	0
agent:but it's going to|agent:i mean i don't think that guns should be outlawed|agent:well uh	um	1
agent:but it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it|user:there is no national|agent:um	uh in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon	1
user:uh-huh [noise] well you know uh uh other than that if you are looking at like|user:uh-huh|agent:because i mean i do think that some people need them_1 and like for protection and stuff and i can understand them_1 wanting to have them_1 but then again it's just like all those nutcases out there	you know country that you know uh where they do have a lot more gun control like England and places like that you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much	1
user:uh|agent:well is the crime that bad there in Atlanta|user:you know so it's so it's really into a kind of a complex problem	i'm not really sure how bad it is i've i've not really had that many problems with it but i mean apparently we we were ranked pretty high up	0
agent:well now when i first moved to Dallas i moved up here by myself and uh my dad gave me a gun|agent:well|user:you pretty you pretty much stop them and you don't have to w[orry]- you know y[ou]- and then and then the actual shot doesn't go that far you know a wall will stop it pretty much	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:[noise] well that's why i ended up giving it back to him i thought well you know i don't want it if i don't know how to oper[ate]- you know if i don't really know how to use it and i just didn't want the responsibility|agent:yeah	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:[noise] well the way they have you know they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module or down the hall or [vocalized-noise] a lot of people aren't going to get up walk out of their offices and go there|user:what would be more efficient about it wha[t]- wha[t]-	uh-huh	1
agent:so um what else do they do in the Dallas area|user:uh-huh|user:yeah	well um as far as TI's concerned i'm not sure um and	0
agent:anything extra|user:i guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them and it doesn't cost the patron anything doesn't really cost the uh department|user:patron is to separate them and then the the uh	right they don't pay they don't pay for the recycled items	1
agent:um but i- i don't know i know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments|user:um-hum|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:uh-huh|user:right that's that's sounds like uh probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have [laughter] i'm single so	i guess	0
agent:uh every six months i have to pay my taxes so|agent:for instance there are certain things that i know -[w]ill come up uh every so often every six months i have to pay car insurance|agent:uh i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside uh like i kind of fence off areas of my check book	um-hum	1
user:making every effort to|user:an amount in my mind and i'm|user:so i kind of have uh	to [vocalized-noise] put a little bit away and	0
user:right|user:i see|agent:well i've thought about it but leasing wouldn't i you know i don't use it for my business my wife uses hers just for pleasure and i use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away so	but if you're rolling it over every three years it might	0
agent:um-hum|user:as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brake shocks and all that so i just went through that whole set last year|user:m[ost]- most of them_1 were just kind of uh you know the	and i'm hoping i'll be have a slow period before i need that again [laughter]	1
agent:yeah it is but i'm not really from [laughter]|user:i don't know i- i shouldn't make stereo types but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think|user:i don't know coming from Texas you're probably	yeah	1

agent:right|user:you know you might do the same thing|agent:sure	and so it's like i don't know i[t]- it it does it takes the sport out of it for me i would much rather have a bow any time [laughter]	0
agent:yeah|user:have you uh you eaten yet or whatever|user:you uh	is it seven o'clock there	1
user:um-hum|agent:huh although i won't claim tha[t]- that the that that we're doing everything and it's uh you know i i try to recycle uh papers and cans|agent:so i i'm beginning to see some uh real positive effects i mean	um-hum what about glass they have glass	1
user:i see so|agent:it's still up to the individual i[t's]- it's not really part of any uh a government sponsored programs or anything|agent:uh so	so um do you actually live in Atlanta	1
user:now where's the city the city limits it's kind of odd that a city would actually spread over|agent:uh we have uh|agent:uh on that sense	um more than one county the city limits would actually fall into more than one county	1
agent:i think that we you know i think they ought to really start pushing it more you know the idea that you were talking about where they they separate each each container|user:huh|agent:uh but they but they they do indicate that service	um-hum	1
agent:[noise] uh well w[ell]- Dow Jones for example have a|user:oh uh that's interesting you said computer networks um what uh what sort i'm fairly knowledgeable about|agent:most everyday	oh okay that's	0
user:uh do you do you get any uh|user:but uh yeah it|user:um i've never uh used the Dow Jones news wire	do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader	0
agent:that's right well even if it's not technical if it's um social thing or or whatever it doesn't matter if i'm expert in it they usually make mistakes which leads me to believe that the things i'm not expert in that they're telling me lies|agent:it|agent:and	[laughter-yeah]	1
user:whatever|user:i haven't really noticed them doing that but|agent:which is which is rather disturbing i know ABC does that	again i don't watch TV news that much now if i had access to CNN i would watch TV news more	0
user:employers screening|agent:[noise]|user:[noise] so what do you think about uh	you know job candidates for drug drug usage	1
user:right|agent:and that might not be a bad idea i've see a couple that look like they might be on drugs|agent:actually [laughter] does um routine screening for their workers	yeah it always should be mandatory for some uh positions such as those	1
agent:but on the other si[de]- hand it's they need to be around people that have their lives together|user:um-hum|agent:and that's in some ways good it lets them feel like they have support	[laughter-true]	1
agent:uh-huh|user:it's something i may do eventually|user:no but i i could	so um from that perspective i can i'd see the	0
agent:no kids yet|user:oh yeah|agent:uh no i don't i'm a college student actually	[laughter] well i've got preschoolers so	0
user:[noise]|user:[noise]|agent:i mean i'm a math major and when i was in high school you know i i think i could of handled a lot of the work that i've been doing here in college at a much younger age and i believe that that's the way that it used to be in this country a long time ago and that it probably is in a lot of other countries too because your your math professors or whate[ver]- whatever will always go yeah i was doing this stuff back in high school and you're like well [laughter] you know then why the heck is it you know my third year in college and i'm just now getting to it	yeah	1
user:uh for a company that|user:one of the things that uh my husband works for|user:you know i don't feel like that's their that's their place um	w[ell]- [noise] well he works for Frito-Lay but they had a	0

agent:six or seven thousand employees|agent:yes i work for North Carolina State University which has about|user:do you uh work for a large organization	wow what do you do	0
agent:uh the additional amount you have to pay to cover a family has gone up quite rapidly|agent:and i wouldn't be real surprised if that's the case um [noise] uh yeah they people are uh complaining because the rates for families uh wh[at]- you know the the uh [noise]|agent:just for the university	oh yeah	0
agent:and you would sort of think that the people who have one income kind of need it more|agent:better in the sense that that people who had only one income in the family would get as much as people who had two|agent:if if there were a tax credit then everybody would get it regardless who they worked for and you you would also be	yeah	0
user:[noise] okay_1|agent:[noise]	um what do you think	1
user:but|user:and it's been a pretty good truck|user:i have a Ford right now	some of the things are not that good about it and Ford sales have been really bad in terms of cu[stomer]- uh customer service at least for me	0
agent:yeah|user:and he's been driving a lot of mini vans in the last like five or ten years|agent:uh-huh	and uh he generally goes with i think the Astro Van	1
user:yeah|user:you know|agent:yeah doesn't that sound neat if you were gonna if you if you could afford two cars and you were going to do a lot of city driving	um-hum	0
agent:sitting in behind our house and the kids are convinced the older two kids are convinced that that's going to be their cars|user:oh really|user:yeah	[laughter]	1
agent:it's suppposed to be|user:yeah i've heard some good things about that car actually|agent:you know is the Mazda Miata	yeah	1
agent:no|agent:[noise]|user:[noise] well do you have children	you don't have children	0
agent:and she didn't take very good care of the kids and you know you don't want to send your kids to place like that|agent:and that it was just dirty and|user:oh boy	no it's really scary and there does seem to be more and more of that if people are doing it	0
user:yeah but that's what i've heard is that that you've got to earn an awful lot|user:yeah|agent:no i don't	i mean you know	0
user:didn't set me up for a career|user:no i think it's going to be hard i feel like i was i was lucky to get to be at home and there were a lot of times that it was boring and it and it certainly isn't true is true that didn't [vocalized-noise]|agent:[laughter-no]	but at the same time uh	0
agent:i'm not really sure [laughter-i] [laughter-haven't] looked into [laughter] i don't need it [laughter]|agent:but um|user:uh-huh	well what about you and your own background di[d]- did your mother or father stay home or di[d]- did they work or	1
agent:uh would admit to the fact that that these drugs might impair their abilities|agent:uh it's obviously something that's a necessity it because_1 it because_1 the function of the job is is within all e[veryone]- pretty much everyone in the world|agent:a bus train pilots	uh-huh	1
agent:[noise]|user:and i know a lot of people refused to a lot especially at the nuclear plant or would uh you know strongly object to it but|user:for drugs	uh you know i could see the need for it so i i went along with it	0
agent:for a long period of time|user:uh-huh|agent:you know unless you ve[ry]- unless you uh uh PCP does exist apparently in the blood stream	right	1
agent:right|user:yeah i i think that people who do something that could hurt somebody else|agent:they should also regu[late]- see it's a it's a it's a disturbing trend	uh should be subject to the testing i guess that's probably the the way i'd term it and i'm talking about bus drivers as you mentioned and pilots and what have you	1
user:um|user:it's it it's quite often you know be a very hazy sort of day you know because there'll just be this pollution hanging in the air|user:and you know it's generally you know	i think a lot i think m[ost]- well i think most of our problems caused by automobile emissions	1
user:in[dustry]- industry pollution but it just seems that|user:you know having regulations at least in the last twenty years or so about|user:um	i th[ink]- i think i think we really suffer because you know we don't have any sort of an organized mass transit system any sort of you know like high speed rail	0
agent:then the reaction will go farther|user:um-hum|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:if they come along and they add new freeways so let's say they reduce traffic congestion|user:um-hum|agent:and it'll come to a balance and then	um-hum	1
agent:okay downtown|user:i basically live downtown|agent:you don't live too clo[se]- do you live close to the city or far away from it	and i go to school at Georgia Tech which is pretty much located in the heart of downtown or	0

user:and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one and then the next pay check we're|agent:checks yeah|user:um-hum	real short or	1
user:a[nd]- and we did this we're not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down|user:write down|agent:[vocalized-noise]	everything that we bought with you know	0
agent:it kind of forced us to uh|agent:in an envelope or whatever and that way|user:[noise]	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:i|agent:yeah|agent:[noise]	my husband just graduated from the university uh [noise]	0
agent:right|user:so like the the set price at the beginning of the year last May was five sixty four a share|user:and you get it at eighty five percent of the lower of the beginning and the end price for the year	stocks trading about fourteen now	1
agent:yeah but i- i get a i get a pretty good i work for the City of New York|user:yeah benefits other than salary|agent:yeah what are we supposed to talk a[bout]- sa[laries]- [noise] benefits besides salary is that [vocalized-noise]	[noise] um-hum	1
user:and you know i can always take the money off of that if i wasn't saving up for the house i would be putting money into a 401K|user:but um i chose to go into the stock program because you can't lose on it|user:yeah we we we've got a 401K here	but you know i'd much [laughter-rather] get the eight[een]- eighteen percent minimum return on the stock and use that for the house	1
agent:right|user:but you know if if you know you know so you wanna underestimate a little bit so like you know i know i easily have a thousand dollars or five hundred dollars a year of dental and and misce[llaneous]- miscellaneous medical and deductibles|user:it just disappears	so i just have them_1 pull you know five hundred it means i pay like	0
user:you know it depends how flat it is if it's um|user:um|agent:okay	i don't like working in an organization where you're really deep in the tree	0

user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter] [laughter-okay] [laughter] all right [laughter]|user:they're like late forties early fifties but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement [laughter] [vocalized-noise]	they seem to have you know they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players they keep on dying and they keep on replacing them and the new ones in his thirties you know	0
agent:[noise]|agent:i don't know|agent:that so [noise]	so um have you seen any concerts lately	1
agent:uh-huh|user:lifestyle choices consi[dered]- i i don't think|user:over uh my	considering i don't think it affects my job and like nobody	0
user:and yeah well also i what i think is a a problem is that there's a|agent:uh yeah and not to mention the legal ones which they don't even care about|user:[laughter] you know i- i don't know i think drugs are pretty pervasive in our society [vocalized-noise]	there's a lot of things out there that will	0
agent:right|user:and he he tested positive and he it ruined his career he he uh|agent:[laughter-okay]	he was drummed out of the Air Force and he spent i think something like seven years	0
user:oh you know but i but i also|user:yeah|agent:while accomplishing you know whatever you think you're accomplishing is really quite high	uh you know you read things about uh like train car conductors	0
agent:well i can see there be yeah i mean i actually it's some some mixed mixed feeling about feel i mean i feel like okay if you're going to do testing|user:i wouldn't want to have to like you know piss in a little paper cup whenever [laughter] you know|user:yeah but then again uh you know i also if i was a conductor i- i i wouldn't want	[noise]	1
user:should we really be talking about [vocalized-noise] what should we be should we have legalized drugs|user:[laughter] you know and [laughter] and i'm beginning to i'm i'm i'm starting to think a little more a little more about this is that i guess|agent:[laughter]	you know	1
agent:right|user:[vocalized-noise] yeah that sh[ouldn't]- shouldn't happen but unfortunately it it can|agent:to close the case do you know what i mean	uh i i'm in i think we're pretty much in agreement uh in Texas this	1
agent:um i think that in my belief i bel[ieve]- we uh i believe that if a person has killed|agent:right|user:and every now that was in the sixties every now and then he comes up for parole it just scary that he could actually get back out	[noise]	1
user:um-hum|agent:if that shouldn't be capital punishment but if they're the high ones that are making these drugs and importing them i think that you could consider that because in essence they're taking lives|user:oh yeah	oh i'd i	1
agent:[laughter]|user:fairly quickly i don't have uh you know [vocalized-noise] we're in so much agreement i guess i'm try to play the devil's advocate|agent:so	uh	1

user:yeah|agent:oh yeah|agent:uh-huh	so i don't know it's it's	0
user:that was good|agent:yeah|user:a a nice nice sideline of it so	but uh	0
agent:um-hum|user:i attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling|user:the other day	and uh	1
user:solutions actually they were|user:they really didn't propose any|user:oh	the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the EPA	1
user:yeah we're doing some here in|agent:which isn't good for business on the other end either i suppose|agent:i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore	in Cash Valley the community here	0
user:so one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for uh paper or something like that to go is to|agent:well that's good|user:and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them_1 because they're actually buying it and shipping it in from outside	get some sort of business to actually want it once you've collected it	1
user:he came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's|agent:[noise] oh really|user:and it was really quite amazing because_1 he says well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them_1	it's low weight but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space	0
agent:and it is a tough decision to make [laughter]|agent:care of the elderly i am looking at this right now with my father|user:[noise]	um-hum	1
agent:when when this is what what happens|agent:but there comes a time|agent:and i hate it	yeah	1
agent:other solution there is eventually we're going to have to put him in a home some place|agent:but uh i don't know what|user:yeah	oh it it right now though he's independent enough to to take care of day to day or or ha[ve]-	1
user:yeah|agent:New York okay i'm in New Jersey|agent:state	uh-huh [vocalized-noise] yeah	1
user:you know so due to the nature of the business it um|agent:oh okay|user:yeah yeah i'm a consultant	you know my base line is average and i don't get that back on the other half back	1
agent:and you don't uh|user:yeah if you're unfortunate enough not to buy a house which if your life style doesn't|agent:where if you don't happen to buy a house or something like that	make it desirable	0
agent:yeah|user:you know|agent:um-hum	so uh you know what's going in -[ha]s got to be a lot more -[th]an going out if it can pay for all that stuff	1
agent:progressive|agent:worse|user:i'm not too familiar with that expression regressive versus what does that mean	yeah	1
user:paper container|user:and if you buy your orange juice in a|user:i'm sorry on[ly]- not for necessities only for non essentials	it's not taxed but if you buy it in a can	0

user:but|user:and|agent:yeah	well i just i never find the time i had rather do other things	1
agent:and then is it you[r]- your quadriceps that are this worst you mean your legs and|user:a year if i do go and i am really sore after|agent:and	yeah	0
agent:uh here in Georgia they just passed a law for example that every health insurance policy|agent:uh even though you could you might never have any need for them_1|agent:that all insurance policies include particular benefits	[noise]	1
agent:don't get some of those programs but shuffle the money over to another place to lower your deductibles or something|user:yeah|agent:uh uh there might there might be a lot of things that the company [vocalized-noise] is wi[lling]- willing to pay for but that you're simply not interested in and what you ra[ther]- prefer to do is say	the other things they do seem to be willing to spend money in strange ways for instance i know	0
agent:uh everyone tries to be the secondary carrier and it's very difficult to to get it worked out uh i know at at Hayes uh|agent:but um|agent:they dea[l]- they deal with coordination of benefits and and no no particular illness who's the primary [carrer/carrier] and who's the secondary carrier	[laughter] yeah	1
user:pay based on eighty percent of the customary reasonable charges for the physicians visits and won't take into account the fact that by seeing that doctor you're saving them|user:physician yet at the same time they will only|user:you know hundreds of dollars in in billings by going to a research uh	you know a couple of hundred dollars over going to somebody else	1
user:[noise] any of the recycled products uh we're in a community of about a hundred and eighty thousand people [noise] uh [noise] there are areas where we could uh [noise] actually we have a couple of the uh|user:[noise] well here in Saskatoon um [noise] much the same thing there is no curb pick up of uh|agent:drive it like a mile down the road and split it out down there what are they doing up there	handicapped societies type of	0
user:[noise]|user:and so we're able to uh [noise] take it to one of the uh|user:bottles	rehabilitation centers and then they	0
user:uh it's fairly|user:uh with the handicapped group will also accept those so [noise]|user:the recycler	fairly extensive but again it's uh	0
user:and then i have a then then they in turn will get [noise] some money from the bottlers and from the|user:pays back the cost of that deposit|user:run by the handicapped society	the people that do the	0
user:although um|user:employing people to do that kind of thing|user:there's psychological pressure against	scouts and	0
user:collects or people can drop their used newspapers and other papers|user:virtually all of the shopping centers like the shopping malls there are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries|user:collecting uh newspapers they're actually at	in the bins and then the bins are collected	0
user:my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now|user:and she is only about sixty four but she's had some pretty close calls and|agent:um-hum	and so she's phasing out and but she's also a very very very independent person	0

agent:and their body just hasn't kept up with them|agent:but i think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active|agent:and and can get up and move and everything like that that is one of the best things to do	uh-huh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:tell stories about the old times i guess you know you were talking about you're was it your grand mother|agent:well that's true	that was having Alzheimer	0
user:to me because i was just|user:um the question was kind of interesting|user:[noise]	trying to put together a uh long term financial plan and a monthly budget the only thing i do now is	1
agent:medium range planning on finances|agent:well how do you handle the the long range or|user:um	uh	0
user:hm|agent:putting away for her college fund|agent:the money that i'll be making this summer we'll be	sounds good	1
agent:significant travel and that kind of thing|user:um|agent:long range goals like college and	that sounds good	1
user:uh|agent:um-hum|user:are uh going to be involved in this but	well that's interesting i'm uh	1
agent:um-hum|user:experiment and|user:it'd be interesting to see how the data base [vocalized-noise] well i guess we're talking about the	probably try to get back on the	1
user:i guess we'll have to|user:uh|agent:um-hum	factor that in if we['re]- if we're not working for employers that happen to fund that it	0
agent:yeah that sort of a problem|user:so|user:that then it goes through the moon	yeah so um	1
agent:Africa Nigeria|agent:so|user:i see so overseas where would you be going	really	1
agent:uh i'm terrified to speak it in um|agent:my French is pretty good but it's uh Senegalese French so|agent:um about five i guess i can do better in it and	in France	1
user:pick a job uh to choose a job that|user:uh it was important for me to|user:that's true unless it's a large corporation that has a lot of different branches	was in the northeast uh because i like the region and my family is here	1
user:i'm not a clock watcher|user:no one raises an eyebrow but because of that|user:it it works out that if i have to go in late for a reason or i have to leave early for a reason	[noise] if i if i knew they were expecting me there	0
agent:uh the com[pany]- i just just transferred jobs about a week ago [laughter] [laughter] so but uh for the last five years i was in a company that had four weeks vacation|user:um-hum|user:another [vocalized-noise]	wow [laughter]	1
agent:yeah|user:on TV you have to t[o]- put up with all the happy talk and the commercials|user:i get almost all well the majority of my news from radio and news letters which is kind of unusual but it's a pretty cost effect[ive]- or time effective way to do it because	and um	0
user:most of the time s[lanted]- tends to be pretty slanted to the left and you just can't tell really what's happening for i mean take for example the economy|user:yeah that's right well i mean the the only thing about them is that they the the their news uh|agent:yeah exactly	where they've not not not them alone but	0
agent:yep|user:no no on on radio they have an hour a day news program|user:uh	but that's	1
agent:yeah i think uh what is it the fourth column of page one is uh kind of famous in it's own right just for human interest stories or business interest stories i me[an]-|user:they they have good in depth articles mostly on things that have to do with you know credit cards or other things relating to to financial things or or financial planning but they also have some good in depth articles beginning on page one|user:so that's that's true yeah bu[t]- now i like the Wall Street Journal if i subscribed well let's see if i subscribed to a newspaper i probably would get it it's it'd be that or USA Today but um	um-hum	1
agent:so well what what are you guys doing with recycling|agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	uh	1
user:it's like um mean personally|user:[laughter]|agent:anybody who wants funding or doesn't want their landfills closed and sued [laughter] has to uh recycle	i've never been a recycling nut	0
user:i mean generally when i'm right when i if i go by the waste bin|user:normal waste i'm not really sure and there's trash cans too|user:i don't know i guess they recyc[le]- i guess they can recycle	i'll put something in there if it fits	0
agent:well maybe that's a good way to uh promote recycling is just to make it more available|agent:right well i think|user:if the the recycling bin is not there i'm pro[bably]- i'm if it was there i'd use it	yeah	0
user:i mean if it's there they're going to do it|user:make people do it|user:would um	still i mean some people won't even go that far out of their way	0
user:[noise] people more aware|user:green thinking should call it|user:type of thing	more aware they need to save the environment and all that	1
user:[noise] um they do have reusable cups that people can|user:well i think it's possible to recycle styrofoam but it's more expensive|agent:because_1 the paper doesn't break down either	uh i mean basically you've got carry around this cup if you want to	0
agent:uh sometimes it is there's no alternative|user:hm|agent:well i think that it it varies on on the individual basis	um-hum	1
agent:yeah|user:yeah and it depends on how how sick the person is too and what you're capable of like if you have a family to take care of you know of your own [noise]|agent:what do you think	yeah um	0
agent:so|user:that's true yeah [noise] but i think nursing homes can be good just depends on what kind they are you know an you need to check them_1 out|user:[noise] yeah	ahead of time	1
agent:um-hum|user:and she really liked the idea of of moving there she's not ill yet|user:well my uh grandmother's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it [noise]	but um she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years	0
user:right some support|agent:a security there|user:uh-huh	and then there's also a sort of a wing for those people that do get sick	0
user:sh[e]-|agent:so it's not sort of like uh uh a sick place [noise]|user:yeah	um-hum	1
agent:okay we can start off there let's just get started i don't wanna we[ll]- you know uh talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it [laughter]|agent:oh okay|user:you know and and we need you know better health insurance and	you know cau[se]-	1
user:like S[aturday]-|user:forty hours is just too long you just don't have any time to do anything it it seems|user:and	Saturday you you get off but Sunday you're getting ready for Monday	0
user:well what happens is that if if people start becoming having chronic illness and|user:okay and so they get a specific rate|user:a policy where they have s[o]- X amount of of users in it	and and things like that	0
user:i don't like bosses that that you know wanna|user:one of the things that i- i really hate about jobs i don't|agent:[laughter]	yell at you and you know and are are down your back and all this and that i- i just really can't deal with that so	1
user:[noise] okay|agent:[noise] so uh what are your camping experiences like	[laughter] lately they haven't been much but as a child i used to	0
user:they are|agent:uh a tent of some sort but they're really expensive like the good ones|agent:i haven't been [vocalized-noise] lately i have i've i've wanted to lately but there's a i'd like to i need to get some equipment first and i don't really have the money for it now i've i've been looking into like buying uh	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah|user:like i say i it brings back memories of|agent:[laughter]	my real young years and uh	1
user:[laughter]|agent:they're getting started early this year i'll tell you that much the so the dogwoods are already starting to bloom|user:really nice place for camping	have they oh well that is really nice	1
user:and uh|user:live in New York and capital punishment is illegal in this state|agent:[noise]	it's just coincidental that that's the way it is but my feelings happen to be that i'm against capital punishment	0
agent:does he really have the right to [vocalized-noise] continue living and be a burden on society|agent:just blatantly slaughtered painfully killed ten people|agent:so if some person	i don't think it's a matter of the of the murderer's rights i think it's a matter of our uh	0
agent:def[initely]-|user:and making them earn their their pay|agent:yeah i agree with that part yeah	but i think life imprisonment is a much better alternative	0
user:i can't see executing|user:but uh i i can't see|agent:yeah	people it just seems so barbar[ous]- barbaric	0
user:okay|agent:i'm one of those guys [laughter]|agent:yeah	um	1
agent:let's see no disability insurance no va[cation]- well i ge[t]- in a way i get vacation pay because i get to se[t]- totally set my own schedule|agent:um|user:yeah	uh-huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:but i don't know i think that it would be great if instead of having health insurance and all those things tied to a job the way they are now|user:yeah yeah	uh-huh	1
user:right that's|user:right|user:yeah	that would be a wonderful idea	1
agent:and then after he retired from that he w[ent]- taught school for a while and he had taught school early in his career|user:um-hum|agent:and he was in the soil conservation service	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|agent:can be a real big important thing to get|user:{yipes}	right	1
user:and uh we do research uh the one i'm in the lab i'm in does research in microwaves and antennas|agent:i see|user:oh oh it's the Georgia Tech Research Institute it's affiliated with the university um	and uh we do a lot of research for the federal government	1
agent:i they they've never had a job i mean they've never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes i know they pay taxes but they don't|agent:and|user:um-hum	um	1
user:and expect you know his first day to be an effective|user:and that you know you can't just send someone off to Washington|user:the bureaucracy in our government as is in with most governments is just so complex that there's a very lar[ge]- you know there there is a learning curve	uh Congress person	1
user:uh bothers me about our system is just that|user:uh the other the other thing that that|user:yeah	um	1
user:we're going to just we're [vocalized-noise] i'm i'm just going to you know vote vote against the incumbent every time|user:the uh you know the idea of well|user:so unless you have actual you know across the boards uh limitations	doesn't work you know it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time	1
agent:i think there are i mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain|agent:not having a complete turnover every some small number of years|agent:turn[over]- or	uh-huh	1
agent:that other part of New Jersey exists actually very|user:yeah|user:yeah	right	0
agent:oh e[ven]- even where you do have the inspections you know the inspection is once a year|user:so you get you get a lot of people out there without ETR emission control systems on their cars and things like that|user:don't have a uh inspection law	yeah and it's like	1
agent:of uh the uh freon|user:right|agent:i mean the uh car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources	right	1
user:exactly exactly uh those of kind of yeah those are joining arguments but uh|agent:or or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way where we got to|user:our mistakes [laughter] if if that makes any sense uh in terms of	i don't know that's that's kind of an interesting situation there uh	0
user:yeah you don't get that that source of cleansing anymore|user:yeah|agent:replacing some of the pollutants	are have you been in big cities a long time	1
user:exactly|user:you can|agent:yeah there it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of uh heavy industry you know that would be causing it	yeah	1
user:seem to recall that uh many many other countries have higher tax rates than ours|user:i was also trying to think of whether our tax rates are high compared to other countries i|agent:uh-huh	but they may also get better value for the dollar that's the real question	1
agent:what s[tate]- what part of the country are you from|agent:but uh|agent:um a lot of things i can't change	i'm from Texas but now i live in California	1
user:uh my feelings are is that i i don't really think that they should test for drugs that|user:this is for everybo[dy]- for for private and commercial sector|agent:[vocalized-noise] this is drug testing for government employees only or was it for everybody	you if you gonna take a job	1
user:a|user:and your your your privacy is is just taken away from you just you don't really have|user:there's too many false positives	a recourse if they say well it's it's do you have a positive you know and you say well no that's not really true and they say well okay well here	0
user:i really don't think that uh there are any crimes that|user:[noise] oh let's see um crimes and circumstances actually i'm i'm against capital punishment um probably not for the reasons that a lot of people are i'm against it because|agent:[noise]	warrant executing a person and the reason i think that is because i really don't have the	0
agent:well um yeah in a sense that you know that individual is removed from direct contact with society but that individual then becomes a burden to society a non productive burden|agent:so|user:uh-huh well is isn't locking somebody up i mean equivalent to that	yeah	0
agent:[laughter]|user:so so you kind of get into this hotel phenomenon you know where you|agent:um-hum	got to set up you know some incredibly safe rubber room but	0
user:to|user:that to have a society you necessarily have to|user:i kind of don't buy into the idea that uh	you know terminate somebody if they have stepped across that line because_1 i think there are probably a lot of instances where	0
agent:i think it's pretty expensive to do|agent:collect it but i think the|agent:and collect	uh-huh do you have to do you have to do the sorting or do they do the sorting for you	1
agent:yeah|user:i think i could do more|user:as as much	and i	0
agent:i'm not sure i|user:this bottle bill do you have a bottle bill down there|user:they put in	that's where it's like every ev[ery]- every every can is stamped with like a a nickel return on it	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and he said like some things like the aluminum cans|agent:uh	they they could make money on because aluminum can be	0
user:it kind of i- i don't i don't and well|user:uh|agent:yeah	should i be buying things that can't be reused	1
agent:any number of other things as well|agent:um concern over somebody being under the influence while they're at work but they could easily be under the influence of alcohol or|agent:i made the decision that i would not work for a company that did that um it just doesn't seem right that a company would do something like that i can appreciate	yeah uh well tha[t's]- that's a good point the only uh	0
user:um having drugs|user:if someone knows that there's there's an even greater chance that they['re]- they're going to get caught|user:well i mean i would think that uh	that	1
user:in thinking that that it's we're not doing a good job at fighting the war you know in in trying to crack down on people|user:um|agent:uh-huh	that are using drugs maybe legalizing them and and trying to help those that you know having the resources there to help someone	0
agent:the consequences of that and it's ultimate uh repealment|agent:i guess one uh one other data point is the old um prohibition here in the US|agent:yeah it really is a dirty mess very difficult to come to conclusions	that's a good point that's a good point and although although alcohol consumption did jump	1
agent:uh|agent:i guess not being not being involved in it|agent:or happy you know either way	well i'll tell you the truth when it uh when it was introduced to Texas Instruments it was a lot of hard feeling now my initial reaction was	0
user:uh a dangerous|user:uh drug use is|user:and i don't really consider it uh an invasion of privacy uh in the se[nse]- because	influence on	0
agent:but you know|user:and of course there're problems with doing that you realize because|agent:um	uh this requires a very strong minded management and uh uh a supervisory	0
user:u[nproductive]- unproductive nature of it that basically uh|user:the um|user:uh right um i guess the other objection that i was exposed to at Texas Instruments was	drugs is not a problem at Texas Instruments and the corporation i think are going through this exercise mainly to remain in the good graces of their customer the government	1
agent:so you have to know what night they're doing it and you're not allowed to put anything out any other night so [laughter]|user:oh okay|agent:there's curbside but um for items like glass and and plastic it's only like once every three weeks or something crazy like that	right well we have it once a week they just started it not too long ago and we have newspaper and glass and then like a very select group of [laughter] plastics	0
user:um we have a couple of collection places around|agent:[laughter] uh-huh|user:you know good luck [laughter]	but they're pretty inconvenient to get to and and those you do have to sort and and most people don't have room	0
agent:right|user:but there they've tried and tried to get an area allotted to them for a collection center|agent:okay	and the school keeps saying no because uh there's a lot of people in in town homeless people who collect cans	0
agent:[laughter] yeah|user:well that's great but that's a dollar [laughter]|user:and when you start figuring how much glass you need to make you know if you figure you can fill a big trash can with glass and get a hundred pounds	so it's not a real profitable thing for for people to do	1
agent:i get to pick my own doctor and they have really good benefits|agent:and they're it's pretty cheap per month and they|agent:all of them	uh-huh	1
agent:no that's just me but they can be i have that option but it's more money|user:and uh is your whole family covered or do|agent:but anything minor or just checkups that's all covered	uh-huh	1
agent:not much not for the good but it's really good the benefits are good|user:but not much|agent:yeah	uh	1
user:you know like everything|user:um so you can choose all these different plans some of which pay|agent:oh really	and some of which pay very little	0
agent:coverage but there's|agent:optical|agent:i wish we had some kind of	yeah it's nice	1
agent:especially when they're younger|user:you know you have these periodic appointments and|agent:um-hum	yeah the doctors end up having to come up with some ailment	0
agent:and if and if your doctor's on that list then most of your benefits are better because those doctors are in a chain that works with the insurance company|user:uh-huh|agent:they give you a list	i see so they they're preferred providers	0
user:oh okay|agent:uh every evening at six thirty i believe i watch the national news|user:so [noise] when you say the morning news or evening news or [vocalized-noise] national news is when	well i would probably be a junkie or s[omething]- watch CNN a lot but i don't uh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:the want help wanted ads and so often they they tr[y]- the newspapers are trying to|user:you know my fiance well she was unemployed for a while so she you know really needed to look at the	compete with a lot of other sources of newspap[er]- of news	0
agent:sure was|agent:[laughter-right] yeah|user:i guess a year ago you're probably watching CNN a lot right had that invasion or whatever it is	uh but i- i don't know i guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype look at the [noise]	0
user:but uh one of the ways that i get information is uh everyday when i log in on the computer|user:yeah i guess that's true|user:yeah	i subscribe to this this thing it's free inside the company and it's called Intellect and and they basically uh	0
user:yeah if it was designed with reasonable prudence stuff wouldn't get loose and um|user:either whether the problem's due to leaks or due to failures i would think that um|agent:um-hum	i mean you don't want it to it's not cheap and the thing fails when it does	1
user:so i probably contributed my share there|agent:[laughter]|user:to a car that gets about twenty four miles per gallon on uh the cheapest garbage you can put in it	and um	0
user:that's moderately high|user:and if it flies a hundred hours a year|agent:um-hum	so the amount of dollars spent per	0
user:you know i've always viewed it as um|user:sounds like another issue um|agent:[laughter]	the pollution issue as a property rights issue if um somebody dumped their garbage in your front lawn	1
agent:or innocent i you didn't say which way it went|agent:then|agent:who weren't convinced that the fellow was guilty	i think it was ten [laughter-people] [laughter]	0
agent:the judge does all sentencing for everything except capital cases here|user:oh is that right otherwise the judge does it|agent:[vocalized-noise] um here in Georgia the only time that the jury gets involved in sentencing at all is in capital punishment cases	do you think that's appropriate or should it be changed	1
EMPTY	[noise]	1
agent:i'm outside a lot i work on airplanes so i do a lot of walking there [laughter]|user:yeah|agent:so	okay_1 so you consider that your exercise	1
agent:a little bit i don't you know really particular like running but [laughter]|agent:and running|user:um-hum	yeah [laughter] well it's kind of hard on the joints	0
agent:[noise] yeah|user:or get out when it's cold or whatever|agent:yeah	yeah	0
agent:[noise]|user:yeah after you do it|agent:yeah	so and we encourage each other	1
agent:yeah [vocalized-noise]|user:it's kind of hard to it's like you have to schedule a time and stick to it|user:yeah	but it's hard when	0
user:you can um|user:yeah well maybe you can|user:um-hum	i don't know do a lot of walking like you are and	1
agent:oh|user:thirty minutes three times a week|user:she just does it thirty	and that's not too much time	1
user:okay i thought it was supposed to give a recording but anyway|agent:okay|user:[noise]	um	1
agent:i don't really have this major budget or anything i just really i'm real thrifty i take care of you know two children and me and|user:yeah i|agent:you know so they come in i pay them_1 and that's it [laughter-you] [laughter-know] that's about the extent of it you know	um-hum	1
agent:i don't have too many weaknesses but i found out a credit card was one of them_1|user:because they come in at the end of the month|agent:i don't have too many wea[knesses]-	uh	1
agent:do you|user:yeah|agent:you know	i don't understand the idea of paying somebody to	0
user:i don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer to too much stuff like that because i wanna make sure|agent:things to add up so|agent:you know	that that i	0
agent:[noise]	[noise]	1
user:but from i understand there's sometimes whenever the juries make the verdict i mean the uh the sentencing|user:uh as far as sentencing goes i'm not real clear on|user:and so exactly some of the procedures that they go through for the jury	and sometimes they don't	1
user:yeah|agent:persuaded or or or how shall i say this th[is]- it's easy to hoodwink or it's it's hard to hoodwink him that kind of thing|user:persuaded	yeah yeah	1
agent:it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed|agent:nature of the uh courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that|agent:yes we do practice capital punishment but the	yes that's similar to Georgia uh	1
agent:quicker maybe yeah|user:in a more expedient manner if there weren't so many appeals|user:well i think it would be more successful if it was applied	yeah if	0
agent:and i have the same thirty seven in my office every day|agent:five hundred of them_1 are good solid kids|user:um-hum	um	1
agent:that's true|user:[laughter]|agent:to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard	i'm sure it is yeah	1
agent:well you know somebody elected that recently|user:well you always have [laughter-castration]|user:um-hum	yes i read about that	0
agent:diseases like that|agent:does does like d[o]- do health insurance policies like for companies and things do they cover|agent:exactly	i think they cover AIDS but what they do is um if you know you apply for for to get a a insurance policy	0
agent:yeah|agent:[laughter]|agent:uh-huh	but um	1
user:um-hum|agent:i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it's you know where it's predominated so far because it's you know it's bound to spread|agent:and uh	i mean it seems that you know	1
user:so do do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support|user:um|agent:yeah yeah	of	1
agent:[noise]	[noise] personally prefer sports cars and responsive cars i like	0
user:heard things about|user:it's uh an eighty seven and it's the first turbo charge car i ever owned and i was a little little reluctant about that because i|agent:um-hum	uh other people that owned turbo charge cars that the	0
agent:the the off road that kind of thing hauling things around|agent:and i'm more interested in|user:oh	oh sure	0
user:which we do|agent:right [noise]|user:would ride a little more smoothly especially when when you travel	a a fair bit of traveling	1
user:yeah i was a little uh surprised to find|agent:yeah we just got that a few days ago here in Wisconsin so|agent:yeah	i	0
agent:well it kind of goes the other way with the vehicles that we've had because_1 the Toyota we have now was built in i think Tennessee|user:about as American as you could get as far as manufacturing goes at least|user:i it surprised me i always thought Jeep was	really	1
agent:stay at the the repair [laughter-shop] it just|user:oh no [laughter]|user:oh really	oh really what sorts of problems did you have with it	1
agent:um-hum|user:the inside of the house i always do the i[t]- all the painting in it|user:oh things like uh	and uh	0
user:uh-huh the fitting i think is what is [noise]|agent:ninety percent of the time it was very frustrating takes a long time to get that house done|agent:electrical work and [laughter] the fixtures and the appliances and it seems like	took us so long you know the measurement and fitting it trying it taking it down fitting it again that	1
user:he races cars|user:on it and my husband has a workshop in it [noise] or uh|user:and uh but we did all the finishing out	and we needed a spare [laughter] garage there	1
user:for us that|agent:uh-huh it can cause a lot of damage i know|user:a mess	yes and so	0
user:and you can get them_1 at discount stores fairly cheap and uh|user:and uh|user:like it did before	[noise] we can do it ours[elves]- it's not that much trouble just	0
user:because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time|user:it's really being used today it it you know it it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything|user:you know my feeling is that uh	the people end up waiting on appeal	1
agent:yeah but|user:right i mean it's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon you know i'm invulnerable i don't need to care about this|agent:well that's committing them mostly is you know either crimes of passion or at the moment or they think they're not going to get caught or	you know i- i- i'm never gonna get caught	1
user:[laughter-right] you you can apologize nicely but you know|user:[noise]|agent:yeah it's it's yeah once you've made a decision that way it's a little difficult to go back on it	you know i think you know the the price you know it	0
user:yeah and and you know [noise]|agent:that yeah the the risk is almost not there|user:[vocalized-noise]	uh especially you know i live in in Massachusetts you know w[e're]- w[e're]- we're gonna get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something	0
user:and you know i- i think|agent:right|user:put on death row from what i've seen	when you listen to like the uh the the victims' families and things they're always talking about you know	1
agent:yeah well i- i think on some of it you have to say someone's responsible for his actions i never like the uh|user:is someone responsible for their actions|user:you know you really get back to the question of you know	society made me do it yeah	1
user:and they were talking about how Dukakis his statements were like in a tenth to twelfth grade reading level while Bush's were down around an eighth grade level and by that|user:uh reading ability or something or other and things like President Bush's uh statements to the public and they were comparing him with Michael Dukakis back during the old uh the the last election nonsense|user:it [vocalized-noise] talked about the uh uh level of	uh being able to convey to that lar[ger]- much larger of an audience you know he	0
agent:they're not neighborhood uh press anymore|agent:how should i say is becoming|agent:uh	yeah and national	1
user:oh that's cheap|agent:uh subscription type thing where you can pay the guy forty dollars a a year which is pretty small potatoes|agent:bookstore that has a uh	and you get to call in across a modem	0
agent:uh-huh|user:any information on the candidates i mean i- i voted yesterday and|user:i to me it's really hard to find um	and uh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:yeah i that's um i don't know what it was that we had that i had yesterday got it from someone in our church|agent:but uh other than that it was a very good way to to see who you sympathized with and you could vote on the basis of that	that uh	0
agent:uh-huh|user:of questions and it wa[s]- it probably had twenty or thirty questions on it it was really you know that was really good and helpful and it you know it had them|user:and so it had kind of a variety of of um	you know supp[ort]-	0
user:[noise] so uh|agent:[noise]	whe[re]- where do you -[g]et your current events	1
agent:get interested in a news article so i guess a little bit leaks through there|agent:my roommates watch the news sometimes so sometimes i'll get|user:uh-huh huh	uh-huh	1

user:what you owe|user:keep going into debt you're not going to payoff|user:that's kind of a basic thing of economics i guess keep spending	so i guess the	0
user:a proportionate amount of taxes to i guess|user:so i i kind of don't pay|user:i guess i'm a i'm a student right now and i don't make a whole lot of money and	uh	1

agent:well that videotape was just horrible|user:um it's in Ventura and there's there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously and it's kind of it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that uh that|agent:oh	yeah it was everywhere	0
user:and a lot of the usually fatalistic|user:i haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but i- i rather imagine there's [noise] there's some snickering about it|user:they well i guess it depends on who you talk to i haven't talked to uh	oh here we go again folks kind of stuff	1
user:[noise] uh i[t]- something else along those lines there was a girl out here|user:i don't know you know and and again there's something else th[at]- you know there was a|user:[noise]	named Latausha Harlins i don't know if this this got this got as much notoriety but it's rather	0

agent:i see|user:the[y]- you know they they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes|user:they would've had a hard time retaliating because	they basically would've you know had a had a f[ly]-	1
user:[noise]|user:you know it|user:um-hum [noise]	well to begin with you know i pretty much question our what what what the US's motives were in uh in in in actually the original involvement	1
user:but i- i think i think that|agent:right|agent:um	that um	1
user:there were there were a lot more|user:i think i think it was it was|user:and i- i really don't i really don't think that	demographic related interests involved than	1

user:i doubt about that are are is America i mean are we pretty|user:[laughter]|agent:well maybe maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's [vocalized-noise] rolling towards whatever it's rolling toward	pretty steep compared to most countries	1
user:uh-huh|agent:and all the A T M transactions and everything and i've got a file for each of them_1 and|user:and all the credit card	how do you categorize these things that's what always sort of stumped me when i sat down to do it	0
agent:and that|agent:right|user:okay so that insures that the bills get paid before other things get paid for	now do you uh-huh go ahead	1
user:oh yeah so do you do anything about|agent:because_1 you're always got to have money when you have [laughter-kids]|user:uh-huh	you know saying hey i'm willing to spend this much a month on food and this much a month on	0
user:okay|agent:right|agent:right	and things like um	0
user:uh-huh|agent:no usually i just pay it out of whatever paycheck uh is in that month because_1 after i pay my regular bills i usually have approximately a hundred and fifty dollars and with that hundred and fifty dollars i pay things that come up like insurance|user:and and so you i mean each month before that do you put away you know one tenth one twelfth of it or	uh-huh	1
agent:an annuity is an account it's like a uh it['s]- it's a type of savings account okay but you don't touch it you just deposit money into it but you don't touch it other than that|user:um so now what exactly in an annuity i've always found those a little confusing|agent:so	okay	1
agent:very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden|agent:one thing that i noticed is it's very|agent:um the bad was more apparent i think at least for me because i think it affected people's lives on in a way that you could see one	oh really	1
user:uh that is something i've heard i- i had a friend uh|user:i that is|user:yeah	that i worked with that was from Sweden and that was uh probably the m[ajor]- the major concern i have is that	0
user:and uh|user:in a lot of ways is is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor and|user:uh the the competition i[n]-	they have to compete to be to be good and to be knowledgeable	0
user:i[t]- yeah and so i[t]- i[t]- it's i think i to me i think|agent:oh i see you're not saying it's right you're just saying it's common|user:i don't think that is that is uh abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all	uh something that's going to help our medical	0
user:don't keep on top of it but there are other things that just happen|user:mistakes because they just|user:there are some people that i'm sure make	that you can't you know you can't	1
user:ah|agent:for the speech group uh here|agent:work and uh implementation work for the speech	what is that how you heard about this thing	1
user:exactly|agent:they've got you slaving away at [laughter-at] [laughter-this] [laughter-point] [noise] yeah|agent:[laughter] right so your pretty they're	exactly what about you	1

agent:right|user:with my dad's uh health plan at his where he works but|user:part of it there because_1 that that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems my dad i think my i'm still covered on	it definitely be something to look into i guess once i get my own	1
agent:um income caps on Social Security to the point [laughter-where]|agent:yeah i figured for [noise] and they've just raised the|user:you know pay an extra five percent or so	hm	1

user:yeah|agent:it could be part of continuing education maybe for judges [laughter] i don't know|user:um-hum	right	1
agent:is driving by with a forklift and he pushes the wrong button and he drops a load of lumber on somebody and it injures them_1|user:sure|user:oh okay your talking about corpor[ate]-	okay	0
agent:of that|user:sure|agent:you know the thing that they know maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there and they continue to do it even after they become aware	okay_1	1
agent:going to be able to to cover the unusual expenses such as property taxes and others things that come up from time to time|agent:and try and figure out for the for the year whether we're|agent:not getting a beyond uh what we should be spending in any particular area	um-hum	1
agent:you know the the nice record keeping that it gives you is worth a little bit of extra time|agent:think i think generally people do find that that probably is just as quick to keep by hand the only question is whether whether the additional reports and the uh|agent:yeah i	w[ell]- that's kind of the way i feel and uh	0
user:well it's it's nice to have something you know people say that if you're if|agent:and then hoping the hoping if i get a few raises that i'll [laughter] be able to get beyond that but right now that's all i'm able to save|agent:and i feel like that's at this point the uh the the most important part of our long-term uh savings plans	you're not saving money you're spending more than you earn	0
agent:[laughter]|agent:oh yeah|user:we just bought a house which is another reason why we're really keeping track of the pennies and that stuff	[laughter] and so	1
agent:[laughter]|user:said well you just do this and you fight once and and that's it once a year and that's it|user:making these big financial steps and all this stuff and he	because you've worked out the budget and what you're going to spend	1
user:yeah what we've done see we've only been married three years and i|agent:pay everything else|agent:like a third of the money for the household and i	my wife isn't real good with checkbooks and math and all that stuff and so what i did is i just gave it all to her and i said you have to do it	0
user:the in|user:one of the things that we talked about as being very important is the um|agent:um-hum	the teacher to uh the number of kids	0
agent:um-hum um-hum|user:you can you can request to see if they have had any problems in the past|user:agencies to care for kids like ho[me]- either home or day care	is what i've been told	0
agent:um-hum|user:because then there's some places and i w[ould]- and i would don't this would be a a big minus for the places there are some places that state that you cannot come in unannounced|user:right	you have to have an appointment or you know or whatever	0
agent:yeah it's a scary thing my daughter's been in Houston and had to do it you know just out of the cold she's had to|agent:your sister is um-hum [noise]|user:[noise] no um i like i said my sister's in the process of trying to find one for hers	um-hum	1
agent:um-hum|user:if you've got older children that you just don't want to leave at home|agent:um-hum	sometimes a day c[are]- a a a private home or a day care setting is not the best	1
agent:yes right and what you would want done right yeah|user:and you you really have to find a discipline that that matches your beliefs|agent:um-hum um-hum	or yeah	1
agent:right|agent:um-hum um-hum|user:the hea[lth]- that's right the certification of the of the t[eachers]- teachers	because there's a new state law mandating that	0
agent:you know it just goes straight from me to him and we don't have to go through a bunch of people like you're saying but|agent:but it's just me and him so if he needs something done i do it or|agent:it's it's real easy we don't really have much to do	right	1
agent:so|user:um-hum|user:oh wow	you know one other benefit that tha[t]- just occurred to me i didn't take it as much advantage of it at least not yet in [noise] sometimes big companies will pay for like education	1
user:i would think that a a smaller company you would have a i mean if if if a small company hits|user:yeah but|user:yeah	some niche in the some niche market that that it	0
user:uh stuff for|user:so uh um the only other thing i can think of is uh|agent:yeah	things like uh like if if there's some kind of child care if if someone were married and had kids	0
agent:no|user:oh you had family in San Antonio|agent:that i would have been able to move to to get to San Antonio very much so	oh	1
user:and like i don't know|agent:yeah|user:at least	i mean there's well there's i i've kept in touch with some people from college but but i don't i mean i don't really know	1
user:you could create or maybe create is wrong but|user:you know one of the uh things they're trying to think of is ways|user:um	advocate a societal imperative that would have the same goal	0
user:my uh my interpretation of history is is is that uh [noise]|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:then i'd say uh possibly i mean but it would to be an emergency type thing and i and i don't see that ever happening uh	when there's a real need	0
agent:right|user:you know keep keeping us out of may make it a little more difficult to get into war|user:[vocalized-noise] by volunteer may be a powerful incentive for keeping people out of uh	you know there are times you need to	0
agent:right|user:i'll take the enthusiasm any day cause you can train|agent:um-hum	that person	0
user:hm|agent:so uh someth[ing]- you know uh unskilled people could could do things like that as long as they had a positive attitude|user:yeah yeah	yeah my only concern about projects like that you know there [vocalized-noise] my concern is uh	1
agent:didn't need to be looking at uh two family income at the time|user:uh-huh|agent:we didn't do it very much and we i guess we were in a situation where we	uh-huh	1
user:uh what kind of|user:that are in the child care|user:the number of kids	you know	1
user:we uh|user:we uh|user:so you know depends also upon the the level of the child	take a very close look at finding a a preschool a	1
user:i don't know i i guess we're kind of in the same boat we haven't had to|user:so|user:get to know and work with kids	look very carefully for child care	1
user:[noise] i'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids and i don't want to just take them to somebody i pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere|user:uh|user:i think it's uh important like you mentioned that's a good idea on the uh parent co-op because	i want to trust the people	0
agent:yeah [noise] you know we've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here|user:hope that we can stay in this [laughter-situation] for awhile so|user:to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children and	uh-huh	1
user:an absolute last re[sort]- resort|user:and now i don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore but i i certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was|user:i went to one and it just had a very good activities director everyone was cheerful	um i have a sister that is in nursing school and she's real interested in geriatrics	1
agent:and you know it's the the type of thing that she was living down in Florida my families was up in Maryland|user:oh|agent:and she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died	um-hum	1

agent:[noise]	[noise] well	0
user:yeah i know the my only major objection is that uh|user:right|agent:on the other format newspapers and so forth	i don't think American media spends enough uh attention on	0
agent:Canada those people are usually pretty uh familiar with the politics going on and and the news events in the US and|agent:which is a shame because_1 you go to other countries uh and and they carry quite a bit about the US on the other hand and if you go up to uh|user:[laughter]	um-hum	1
agent:a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it and and ca[me]- came and it was a big thing going on there and i came back here and nothing in the papers|agent:you know picked up a|agent:percent of the people here would never have heard of and i think that i heard of it about the first time when i was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and	right right	1

agent:and it's more in depth|user:what you'd generally think of as news but it's recent material|user:immediate	yeah it's it's more in depth less broad well actually it's probably isn't less broad but it's just more in depth	0
user:[noise] yeah that that's about what it ends up being|agent:news item interesting so you have to wait twenty minutes to to hear about it|agent:uh	listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something [laughter]	1
user:i think it will|agent:that's gonna affect our uh economy quite a bit|user:um-hum	um	0

agent:yeah you know Treasury Certificates and US Savings Bonds and whatever|user:okay who are holding bonds and whatever|agent:yeah nongovernmental	okay	1
user:right and uh|agent:that just goes to pay interest on the debt|agent:and then we're doing a borrowing on top of that of fourteen percent	then the question i mean do other countries do this or is this a distinctly American phenomenon	1
user:you know if you were in charge what would you|user:so what do you think is the uh|user:uh-huh	what parts would you change to	0
user:well it does seem like the uh|agent:i very quickly get in trouble with creditors|user:[laughter]	the quality of the bonds that United States sell would eventually be downgraded doesn't it	1

agent:right|user:yeah well i- i mean i think there's some people there y[ou]- there clearly are some things where you need infrastructure and you need|agent:and a lot of it and if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of its going to waste	you kn[ow]- you know there are things government does better you know i think government does a better space program	0
user:um|agent:instead of real you know good programs|user:you know like we we	yeah i mean we we spend a fortune for things like VA hospitals	0

agent:[noise] okay um so we're talking about drug testing on and how we feel about it in in in the work place|user:[noise]	correct i- i assume this is involuntary drug testing from employers	1
user:with it not being a hundred percent accurate that that leaves open you know quite a bit|agent:um-hum|user:or you know accurate uh	of room for you know false positive	1

user:[vocalized-noise]|user:[laughter]|agent:[laughter] well if you want to move here uh all you have to do is find a job so i guess you trade things off one way or another [laughter]	yeah i suppose so	0
agent:yeah|user:well that that's about the attitude here is just that you know if if you're paying for your local tax you're paying your local school district you can see some results of it but it's if you stop and think that some of that money is going to go get shipped off to South Texas or something|user:huh	you it its almost like i don't know socialism or something isn't it	1

user:i think it is demonstrating by the fact so many people uh graduating from high school and can't even uh perform|user:well i think there is a problem with with the public s[chool]- education system and i|agent:yeah	some simple uh math problems and uh or or even read a a decent uh book	0
user:children to schools and allowing|user:parents a choice of where they send their|user:some competition between schools to give uh	uh the school to compete with one another the become better i think that is the American way	1
agent:not only can not compete they simple didn't you know those kids really felt uncomfortable|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:you know there are some children in this world who i accuse of perhaps [vocalized-noise] you know and and they just	right	1

user:in that [vocalized-noise]|user:um it also simplifies|user:debits req[uire]- require more discipline	doesn't require the discipline to say oh yes that is due on this date and then	0
user:yeah|agent:and that help an often lot to look forward|user:great	oh i would think you know i would think it did	1
user:yeah and that's|agent:but you know it's the same kind of thing where they always thought i was getting mi[xed]- mixed message about that|agent:th[at]- that more of a value [laughter-added] to there house then me going out and getting CD's or something	[noise] that becomes the biggest challenge you know if i think about	0
user:well i fill|user:yeah uh|user:[noise] [laughter]	like uh there should be some gun control but	1
agent:and the and the only thing between the assault rifle and that is a stock is a stock change|user:yeah|agent:rifle for years	yeah that's for sure	1
user:[noise]|agent:it just you know wha[t]- you get up here it gets really weird|agent:and so	yeah	0

user:they they one of the thing that they've tried doing|agent:uh-huh|user:yes and up there they're doing quite a bit	is they've had it they got a uh deposit on all	0
user:so i know that they're doing and up there and several community down here they're not doing a hole lot down here|agent:oh that's really|user:right	uh their actually are some community where they mandating that uh most i think it's aluminum from everything else	0

agent:but um but Plano just needs to get more of these trucks|user:sure|agent:they've they've been doing it for at least [noise] a year or two	unfortunately i think that what we are seeing though is like areas like Plano i where it's not as densely populating	0
agent:or something big whatever you can do|agent:you know you just each person have to consciously think about doing of something little|agent:well it's i just i just think the more you	sure	1
user:yes|agent:are they really well that's neat|user:i- i believe in Baltimore they're recycling glass and using it as part of the asphalt	which they also think it is good because it makes the roads prettier	0
user:she also get paid once every two weeks but her pay checks don't|agent:um-hum|agent:okay	come at the same time mine do	0
user:so that we could approximate how much each bill would be and then budget our pay checks accordingly base on|agent:um-hum|user:and then tried to average it	the minimum amount that we would expect to receive	0
user:no|agent:well i mean you don't want to do it that way you rather just keep it all in the in the bank but uh [noise] my gosh no i you know it's it's funny because when they came on they talked about|user:so uh	right	1
agent:correct and we've been trying to live off my money which is not working [laughter-out]|user:a different account huh um-hum|agent:we've had her money direct deposited to one account and my money direct deposited to another account	[laughter-right] so you can the her money and then save it or	0
user:right|user:um-hum|agent:uh it u[sually]- it it well co[st]- it cost us you know uh five hundred dollars a month to live it doesn't work that [vocalized-noise] one month it's five hundred the next month it's it's a thousand because you get the car insurance bill and then and then it goes down to two hundred because uh you're off on vacation or something or you know you you went traveling and and you didn't spend as much but then you come back and it goes up again and i mean it's	um-hum	1
user:a uh|user:uh disciplined ourselves where we can have|user:so that means that uh uh everytime because we haven't	certain amount set aside each month for when that bill comes	0
agent:right|agent:i rem[ember]-|user:-[a]nother th[ing]- thing is that when doing your drawing you can scale them_1 so much easier thing because their increment of ten's so much easier	i mean your your life is just uh so much easier i	1
user:the screw machine and stuff that makes all those thing they're just they cost millions of you know thou[sand]- hundred of thousand's of dollars and thing and that's|user:well most of them_1 have the matrix set now but it's it's it's uh i think it's more in the the the the bolts and threads and stuff it self i mean the|agent:that right if you think that every gar[age]- corner garage has to buy a whole new set of tools	and i guess maybe they could be re[sented]- some of them_1 could be resented but the comp[any]- the business community just doesn't want to do that i	0
agent:which is a um|agent:{toundar}|user:in what	[vocalized-noise]	1
user:and i guess one of the problem is is that the goal isn't to pro[duce]-|agent:right|agent:right	pro[duce]-	1
user:so you just|user:yeah well i guess|user:um-hum [noise]	[noise] yeah i guess that's that's true	0
agent:what about cardboard|user:or just plain regular paper like computer print out just only for news print only|user:telephone books	that's not included that's that's completely different	1
agent:there's no more municipal trash pick-up|user:um-hum|agent:[vocalized-noise] basically a [vocalized-noise] sign that forces people to recycle you have to pay for all your trash all your trash bags	i see	1
user:out of a container that you've mark only for biodegradable plant clippings lawn clippings|user:uh once a week they'll come by and|user:uh biodegradable type pick-up	uh it has to be decomposable matter no	0

agent:you know she would take her nose and she would flip it open and get out|agent:it would just be she's gone she's gone and she's gone that's it she opened up she opened the gate by herself|user:[laughter]	really	1
agent:oh my goodness|user:just went right back into her pin|user:and then i she came wondering back later that day with a rabbit in her mouth and	and i went out there the next mourning to feed her and i put her food in there and i walked out the gate and pretty soon i heard the gate slick open and she comes walking out behind me i was like	1
agent:uh less then a hundred people|user:but uh the advantages of a [vocalized-noise] h[ow]- how big is the company you work for|agent:uh-huh	okay less then a hundred	1
agent:[noise]|user:and uh that's one of the nice thing a about a company uh interaction with other people access to internet uh do you have internet how did you|agent:yeah	get hooked up to this	1
user:if you're the only|agent:um-hum|user:is uh access to other people that do the same thing	computer programmer in your company then it's it's it is kind of isolated	0
user:uh let see a hundred or so|user:to people uh they they tend to departmentalize and and uh move away where as in a company your size|user:to uh	i[t]-	0
agent:so we're [vocalized-noise] we're in a we're in a bubble diagram and uh|user:[laughter]|agent:um we're not suppose to be talking about this anyway uh	[noise]	0
agent:well that a mile a good way each way|user:to the bus|agent:[laughter]	in the morning yeah and and then then a mile back	1
user:right right it's something i had to do where when i tried you know running around the track|agent:reach your two miles and say well i really should walk that extra mile [noise] [laughter]|user:it's find i right	i felt just a little pointless	0

agent:yeah go head|agent:oh|user:um	well let's see i guess uh	0
user:that's interesting but uh|user:hum|agent:in those situation and all that money adds up and you have enormous cost in the government and people get angry and upset	i guess that's uh something that happen when there is so many people involved	1
agent:would we be able to do what type of oversight would you like to see|agent:uh|agent:but what sort of involvement	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:the ideal of the higher taxes is help us to pay off the high deficit in the state|agent:and|agent:are are angry about their taxes being so high	um-hum	1
agent:yeah|user:yeah b[ut]- it but also uh it this seems kind of it's kind of bad but i think it needs to be more convenient to recycle i mean that that almost seems like it's it's as re[cycle]- as convenient as it could be|agent:well it's a matter of people starting to respect it and understanding what it's for and understanding that it actually does help everybody if they all recycle	but the problem is that you have the garbage dump right there and then you have the recycling d[umpster]- bin right next to it	1
agent:but whereas if you're living in an apartment building there's no way of tracing back who put in what|user:right well that's|agent:or they at least they can i i haven't really heard of anyone doing this if you put recyclables in with your regular trash they can refuse to pick up your trash	right well what they do uh	0
user:how do you uh|agent:um-hum|user:m[ajority]- m[ajority]- majority of the news that i get is from uh AM radio in the mornings but going to and from work i we have like uh a a WCBS station which which just kind of fires through all the top topics	how do you generally find out what's going on in the world	1
user:top topics were in in like a half hour span|user:Headline News was always good because i could get a quick roundup of whatever the|agent:[laughter]	and in Around the World in Thirty Minutes i think was their big thing	0
agent:yeah it's on i guess it was on PBS for a while|user:yeah that's actually on a network isn't it|agent:that that's a good show i like that one a lot	that's exactly right	1
user:like uh|user:typically what i've heard maybe it's just the people i hang around with but typically i hear people saying that|user:like these pre digested sources you know like the like the	the news on TV and what not tends to be um more on the left hand side it tends to be a little bit more liberal and if nothing else it does tend to be more editorialized than these are the facts	1
agent:huh you can stop wondering|user:stop with just the the straight spoon fed you know|user:but i wonder how much of the rest of America takes the time to to	[laughter]	0
user:yeah i- i i agree uh y[ou]- you pay a lot of money into them_1 and then when you finally do have a claim they uh|agent:they're|user:yeah	they really stick it to you they say that it doesn't meet their uh	0
user:for the st[aggering]- skyrocketing uh medical costs like you've said uh|user:and since then you know they've|user:uh when i first came here five years ago they really had like the best i thought that i'd ever had	they've really had to cut back on what they give people because it was just taking too much money out of the company	1
agent:the number of vacation days we have uh only two weeks vacation a year|agent:yeah that that that is a very nice benefit one of the things that we have lacking is|user:i really like that	does it depend on how many years you've been there	1
agent:very short|user:with th[at]- how ma[ny]- how much time did you spend with each one|user:oh okay	oh okay	1
EMPTY	[noise] so	0
user:i understand the principle behind capital punishment i don't agree with it ever a[pplying]- applying capital punishment to anyone|user:even though|user:uh	um because_1 i sort of believe that	0
agent:maybe|agent:eye for an eye hand for a hand kind of thing|agent:yeah i mean it kind of seems going back to uh	yeah	1

agent:[laughter]|user:oh yeah [laughter]|agent:isn't that funny how there's always a story behind something	well that's basically how she got the dog too	1
user:so that's|user:[laughter]|agent:oh i see	uh that's the name there and uh	0
agent:you can't get all three today you [laughter-got] got to give up one or the other|agent:i want something that's reasonably reliable and something that's not likely to get expensively damaged in a small crash and|agent:the thing i want always wanted a car with a big trunk so i can carry a lot of stuff that's one of the prime considerations	hm	0
agent:um-hum|user:has the uh lean burn and all that stuff supposed to be very fuel efficient|agent:um-hum	so it gives you about the same kind of horsepower	0
agent:but uh|agent:so y[ou]- or you or you just can't see around it like somebody could come in from an intersection you couldn't see it because the van blocks your field of view|agent:um so many times you get behind somebody and you wonder what's up ahead and if that person stops then you might have a hard time stopping	what do you have a station wagon or a regular [vocalized-noise]	1

agent:yes|user:yeah that's real frustrating um|agent:that's painful	that's that's one aspect of it i think something that's really important	0
user:true|agent:in their science department in that you could choose the whichever professor you felt was the would be the most enlightening for wh[at]- particular field you were going into|agent:and uh they were kind of pioneers	um-hum	1
agent:um-hum|user:sounds similar to what most schools do in i[n]- on a graduate level|agent:so uh	um where as it sounds like A&M does it more or does it also on an undergraduate level	0
agent:um-hum|user:i think i'm gonna opt for a larger one|user:uh	just because i i think it forces people forces students to be a little more independent	0
user:exactly it's it's an active state it's not something that you can kind of|agent:it isn't gonna just be sitting there and life is something that you have to search out everything you're going to do|user:right um-hum	you know be passively involved in and expect to do	0
user:no|user:i[t]-|agent:does your mother have any help	no and and my grandmother's pretty self-sufficient uh	0
user:i think one of the the toughest parts about the decision would be finding the home|agent:it was exhausting|agent:a proper way and	uh i know in Texas we hear so many of so many abuses in nursing homes	1
agent:oh|user:uh for a number of years but i actually they moved away from there with a daughter before|user:my late in-laws lived at Leisure World	they needed the final care i guess it had graduated levels of care or something in that facility i don't know if you're familiar with that or not it's in Southern California	1
agent:right right|user:i think i can picture that those are the little long haired|agent:she's a little bit oh good she's playing with the ball she's a little bitty white dog	fluffy kind of dogs	1
agent:oh yeah|user:um [noise] but speaking of pets um my brother just got a little Labrador puppy th[at]-|user:yeah well she's really cute and sweet	and i'm living with my brother and	0
agent:well my my little dog has a playmate from uh down the street|user:yeah|agent:that's not good	uh	1
agent:we think it's kind of fun it's better than watching TV to watch the little dogs play|user:huh|agent:yeah	oh definitely and it's better for them too emotionally	0
agent:does she imitate the mocking birds yet|agent:oh yeah|user:i really like the sounds she makes the chirping and all that she sings and all that stuff	no i don't think she's heard a mocking bird	1
user:yeah|user:um-hum|agent:you know i used to do that for my dog too to give her some stimulation but she didn't seem to appreciate it she kind of likes the quiet	yeah i i don't know if if and the dogs are real sensitive with their ears	0
agent:that's right it's just like|agent:[laughter]|user:oh yeah that's a delus[ion]- [laughter]	so you learn quick	1
EMPTY	[noise]	1
user:apparently i heard about it later the guy started it|user:fairly obscure it's published out of Berkeley it's a futurist magazine|agent:no	as a on inheritance money he just wanted to have a magazine of his own and he wanted to be future oriented	0
user:all the rest of them_1|user:and Bloom County now Out Land and|user:oh yeah absolutely	but yeah Doonesbury is great i mean	1
agent:what lie did you catch them_1 in|user:i used to watch them_1 but then i caught them_1 in a bald face lie and i ha[d]- didn't really care anymore|user:yeah	it was a long time ago they just did a hatchet job on ultra light aircraft	0
agent:i know and it's like especially like if with the network news they always comment about everything and their comments are always biased|user:if you assume they're biased and then look for some opposite biases you get a fairly good idea of [laughter-what's] [laughter-going] [laughter-on]|agent:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:[noise]	okay well um let's see	1
user:uh you know something that i always put off because_1 you had to haul the stuff and|user:so we were amazed when we you know recycling's one of these things that we did kind of once and awhile but it was|agent:uh-huh	and so i you know we didn't do it much but i was amazed at how much we reduced	0
agent:i suspect we're having some of that here too|user:after this when it you know after the rates went up|user:there's i don't i- i don't know i hear that there's more of a problem with illegal dumping	a[nd]-	1
agent:uh few things they pay you for most things they just take|agent:oh about eight or nine m[iles]- well i guess it's about six miles from here where you can go and|agent:now my daughter's really a[ctive]- active in some of this and she there's a place	yeah	1
user:they played uh with uh Primus|user:uh-huh|agent:oh yeah	have you heard of them	1
user:but um|user:he was i think he's i read in the paper i was thinking about going down to the Jazz festival in New Orleans it's like a i think might be the end of April|agent:he is he's very good	i think he's supposed to be playing there he played in he played in town in here in Atlanta a little while ago too but i didn't have the money [laughter] it was like eighteen bucks or something	1
user:um|user:i'm i'm kind of i don't know i'm into a lot of different kinds of music too i like th[at]- k[ind]- that kind of jazz and|user:that seems like a long time ago	a lot of different kinds of rock music not really	0
user:but uh they just put an album out|user:they've they've they've gotten in Rolling Stone a couple times|agent:yeah no i haven't	um	0
user:um-hum|user:right|agent:you know in two or in four even meter you know i[t]- they they they mix it up they they do interesting things with rhythms and they do interesting things with	yeah their drummer's unbelievable	1
user:uh-huh|agent:it's mostly remedial work for us [laughter-because] we we we're both out of shape|agent:uh	yeah i bet	0
agent:yeah well also if y[ou]- if you take lessons you might be able to uh|user:i'm improving but slowly and i think i could you know|user:get like i know this guy that i think i'm going to try to get to give me lessons and stuff because_1 there's lots of stuff that i do[n't]- i mean i could	learn a lot	1
agent:[noise]	[noise] so i get most of my news i i am sorry to say from CNN Headline News	0
agent:you know i work in engineering so you get engineering uh stuff uh what i found is that uh|agent:um and then of course there are lots of specialized publications for|user:um-hum	right	1
user:where in Europe|agent:uh but uh you know it's it's it's unfortunate but even even now i mean i used to live in Europe and we still get uh we lived in Germany|user:um it's a possiblity	um-hum	1
agent:it's their view and from wherever they happen to be|agent:the uh the the people who write the history|agent:well it's also again um you know the	um-hum	1
agent:do you really|user:[laughter] what|agent:oh do you	well i walk and i take the bus	1
user:and i s[ort]- been listening to sort of|agent:um-hum|user:and uh i like listening to classical although i'm kind of ignorant about it	like sort of an old foggy station	0
agent:uh-huh oh Metallica's been around for ages|user:now some of these have been a l[ong]- -[a]round for quite awhile haven't they|agent:bands like Nirvana and stuff i don't know if you've heard	how many years do you think	1
agent:my favorite ones to play are uh stuff like Mozart i love Mozart and uh|agent:um|user:what kind of pieces do you play	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah|user:and that i still keep up with a little bit but|agent:oh that's neat	you know i'm s[till]- i'm doing what kind of sounds similar to what you're doing i i have pieces i could play in high school	0
agent:hm|user:oh God course the name just uh the name just slipped my mind but it's the Peace of Parliament|agent:uh	is that like	1
user:uh-huh|agent:i- i- i think i think that Primus gets a little air time on like MTV and stuff but i don't think i i don't think i've ever heard one of their songs on the radio Fishbone either|user:uh-huh	so you have to get the albums	0
user:[noise] when we did it [noise] we we didn't really have child care we had uh like|user:it uh|user:uh uh i haven't thought about that as much as i	uh day school	1
user:day care for kids that are|user:uh|user:but i guess there is a difference between	couple years away from school and and uh	1
user:to rely on|user:lots and lots of kids it's [noise] it's much tougher to uh|agent:um-hum	it's much easier to rely on one person if they're good they're good and if they're bad well you know	1
user:you won't have the|user:but|agent:yeah	the uh	1
user:you know with an individual than i would with a school because with a school if they lose|user:uh stay with uh|user:would rather have my kids	if they have two or three good people and they lose one	0
agent:uh she she has like uh occasional help that comes in|user:doe[s]- does this lady have any help or does she do it all herself|agent:type of uh environment	okay i i wondered about that because uh	1
user:and generally entertainment expense so uh everything seemed to work out pretty smoothly|user:because we would divide up the bills she had her own checking account and she would take responsibility for paying so many bills and i had my own and i would take responsibility for so many and|user:uh in the old days when my wife and i both worked we we probably a little bit more organized with it	but uh that was for about the first uh eighteen years of our marriage	0
agent:too it seemed to work better|agent:the two method|agent:we finally switched to	yeah i think wh[en]-	0
user:yeah well ho[w]- how do you manage control uh or limit your spending or or you know|agent:if it's something that one or the other of us is handling in its entirety then then we just pay it like you do|agent:if it's something we're doing that way if it's uh	do you	0
user:well we went through six years of infertility|user:yeah we went through a period uh|agent:thing too so	and it uh	1
agent:uh-huh|user:but a really prominent sign is that until recently they accepted those plastic milk jugs|agent:uh-huh	and they're probably the main you know source of those things in the first place but they've quit taking those now	1
agent:i think it's like plastics glass paper|agent:you know all the different ca[tegories]- categories of stuff i don't know if they break it out in plastics between milk jugs and other things but|user:yeah	hm	1
user:[noise] that|agent:[noise] yep [noise] so|user:that's an interesting one never heard of styrofoam recycling before	seems like a prime candidate for recycling though	1
user:yeah tha[t's]- that's one problem with uh engineering jobs is|agent:pension fund was amounted to less than three quarters of a year of salary|agent:my vested interest in my	it's	0
user:set the benefits based on|user:what also seems like a lot of company|user:yeah	your last salary when you left the company	1
user:you know it's well it's actually can go both ways someth[ing]- some ways you have|user:well that's one thing you do get with a large company they're|user:um-hum	more opportunities because_1 there're so many things going on within the company	0
agent:yeah|user:this is also possible|agent:or whether it's part of the uh switchboard system	somewhere between Texas	1
user:i guess|agent:[noise]|user:[noise] okay um	i'm not real familiar with recycling because i've been in the army for twenty years so uh	0
user:and uh so we|agent:uh|user:th[ere]- there again there was no recycling program and now there is	we're recycling uh all the cans the glass bottles all the plastic and the newspapers which	1
user:right|user:uh|agent:crops if you will just to because they're the most uh lucrative i think and the most uh technologically feasible to recycle	ours our regular trash pickups are also twice a week	0
user:came up with an idea as well on my own in that|user:now i i kind of|user:hm	i think part of the recycling responsibility falls	0
agent:[laughter-right] [laughter]|agent:uh-huh|user:it's neat that they uh they will rake it up for me off of their own yards bag it for me and put it on the curb for my easy collection [laughter]	and uh	0
user:hm|agent:pe[ople]- people say it's just part of my Karma i'm not a complete vegetarian as a matter of fact i've got some corn beef on the stove right now but|user:gee that's odd	oh [laughter]	1
agent:okay|user:[noise] okay Michelle well since i started off i uh since i called in i guess i'll state my opinion first|agent:[noise]	and uh i i guess i'd fall in the same category that i don't think there should be any restrictions i think that if unless a weapon is self-propelled or has to be towed Americans should be able to own it	1
agent:what do you mean the criminal records are a mess|user:they'd be able to identify those that shouldn't have|user:if the government were to invest in that then there wouldn't be any problem they'd	well there isn't any computerized system that can tell you	0
agent:so you're from New Hampshire|agent:um-hum|user:so it would require an investment on the part of the government to to bring their records up to shape but i think it's uh probably a good investment anyway uh	yes um-hum	1
agent:yeah i know how to use it|agent:uh-huh uh-huh|agent:[noise]	but if it	0
agent:um-hum um-hum um-hum|user:discussion about it and what and now and then it becomes a heated argument in both sides but|user:there's a lot of uh	but i i've i just feel that the founders of our country the co[nstitution]- people that wrote the constitution didn't intend for us to	0
user:figure out the severity based upon his own personal scale the only thing i worry about is|agent:[noise]|user:yeah yeah as as uniformed a[s]- i mean he would he would	like	0
agent:[laughter] Wheel of Justice we [laughter-could] have a game show you know we no there|agent:um [laughter]|user:[laughter-oh] [laughter] oh man	uh	1

agent:um-hum|user:basic busing services and travel|user:provide uh	uh	1
user:um uh actually n[o]- i have tried to get it fixed for example i've had a|agent:um-hum|user:inertia to get through that process [laughter]	i guess a uh a VCR	1
user:i'm saying well you know i'm paying this a lot of money for this uh|user:and the maintenance said it was due to weak signals|user:thing that was being recorded it was very bizarre	VCR and you're telling me just because it hasn't doesn't have a	1
agent:that uh you have trust in their competence|agent:and you almost end up bringing a third party in|agent:considerable knowledge and uh you're not really convinced that they do	[laughter]	1
agent:uh well uh i was just reading something on it as a matter of fact uh|agent:[noise]|user:[noise] okay_1 so what do you think about space flying	oh yeah	1
agent:you can use it to uh pull yourself out of like a low earth orbit|agent:um and it also works uh|user:oh interesting	um-hum	1
user:and you know the offspring technologies can benefit a whole lot of different aspects of society|user:you start to develop things specifically for space use|user:space per se but it also benefits technology you know	so that's	1
user:uh the whole thing with uh|user:um primary of which in my mind right now is|user:this space exploration could give us a lot of different view points o[n]- on current problems	the depleting o[zone]- ozone layer	0
user:and if we if we don't look at that|user:i think that's real important|user:uh	closely we could be really screwing ourselves	0
user:and they're very prevalent you know things like world hunger yeah that's a big uh that's a big problem|user:they're logical and they're|user:problems which you know	um but you've got to have a long term view as well	1
agent:um|user:oh okay great|agent:uh running uh a ga[me]- or one of the three principal partners in a game company	yeah i was just i was asking because it's interesting to see where we're both coming from	1
user:[laughter] and the the vet assures me it he has a large bone [laughter-structure] [laughter-so]|agent:[laughter]|user:nearly twenty pounds	but [vocalized-noise] just a big old Tom [laughter]	1

user:no|user:no|agent:i guess that's a good plan he wasn't fixed when you got him though huh	yeah i it's [vocalized-noise] uh i've never	1
user:oh|agent:yeah yeah but you know but get l[ittle]- i got little kids and they they do a pretty good job of taking care of the dog and so forth so that'll be fun for them|user:the the hardest part is the stage you have right now i think	i think pets are wonderful for kids	0
user:but most of the time it's fun|agent:yeah that's true are you a member of a club or anything is that where you go lift weights are you a member of a club or|agent:yeah	huh	1
user:uh-huh|agent:yeah i i'm trying to like i said i play softball of course not in the winter up here but uh i usually do something for about two months just to get me in shape for that i do a lot of sit-ups and push-ups but|user:but uh	uh-huh	1
agent:i have just one little daughter|user:do you have any kids|agent:there's a lot of area we can go in up around there	oh my goodness	1
agent:okay|agent:um-hum|user:well i think they do some voluntary on the beach but i live in apartments and we don't have it here	um	1

agent:yeah|user:and so it's like a a big hassle|agent:okay	you know to try to get everything together	0
agent:[laughter-we're] in trouble and we got to fix this problem|user:um-hum|agent:yeah that's going to change at some point you know [vocalized-noise] a couple of years ago nobody around here talked about it and then one day everybody just kind of woke up and said gee you know [laughter-we're]	but i know i went to see my brother in Philadelphia	0
agent:okay well|user:no actually we don't we don't have fences it's just uh a tall hedge|agent:well you've got pretty good fencing around your parameter parameter	so	1

user:you know this is a big election this year and everything we all these guys running for president and uh|agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:what to do about it though uh	i	1
user:yeah well the you know the the thing is we get these people in there that are like career politicians|agent:can i say that on this|agent:i'm not agitating for it that's for damn sure	and they're grieved by so many people	1
agent:shotguns you know so i can't imagine what it'd be like if they're doing it with automatic weapons|user:oh really|agent:just [vocalized-noise] help you kill li[ke]- i mean up in Virginia a lot of hunters get killed anyway just with	what kind of gun do you use when you hunt	1
user:but|agent:you have to try to get it out of there|user:shot	yeah	0

user:uh|agent:yeah|user:obviously they don't have a whole lot of fear of	being caught	0
agent:yeah contributing maybe contributing factors too n[obody]- nobody knows about|user:that can be if gun control would solve that problem|user:i don't i don't know if there's anything	yeah	1
user:you know|user:it should go much [vocalized-noise] for|user:i don't think really	rapist or	1
user:i think um|user:yeah|user:[laughter]	i think it's kind of sad people who	0

user:[vocalized-noise] i guess that was it|agent:well uh|user:[noise]	um	1
agent:[noise]|user:and then i guess there's the things for like personal growth like uh|agent:[vocalized-noise]	educational	0
user:you know there wasn't really it wasn't really designed to provide real opportunities for advancement unless you happen to you know like [vocalized-noise]|user:um i guess on research staff there and i i got a feeling that uh|user:that's interesting yeah i- i was actually at uh Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh doing uh	a doctorate in something and then you could	1
agent:they're not doing so good they're not a threat anymore so|agent:since uh|user:well that's interesting	yeah but it seems like other uh	1

agent:because_1 i i- i because_1 when i go to other|agent:yeah there was a lot of uh thought put into that|user:now that the whole idea of them pumping white noise over the speakers to mask out the telephones and things like that it's kind of interesting [vocalized-noise]	yeah	1
user:um|agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	at what age did your father enter the [vocalized-noise] nursing home	1

agent:has to address|agent:there was a greater range of students that a public school has to uh|agent:uh i had mixed feelings on it uh because i thought that	yes that's true they can't root out the troublemakers as easily	1
user:and by spreading thin you mean they|user:uh-huh|agent:on the areas that they taught best	too many students or too many subjects per teacher or	1
agent:trained machinist to tea[ch]- teach the metal shop course let's go find one they just say well you know we have this course we need a body for it|agent:is a|agent:well what we need here	um-hum	1
user:uh|user:in general|agent:um-hum	but i think that	0

user:hey there you go [laughter]|agent:no no that's a thousand pointless lies|user:yeah that's right well as i always like to say back when he was talking about a thousand points of light that's a nice way of saying our platform is full of holes	i'll make that into a tag line in my system	1
user:we had a situation here in Des Moines when um|user:yeah and it's been a long time since i've seen any [vocalized-noise] you know source of the media do anything really gutsy|user:um-hum	it was right after Jeffrey Dahlmer had been apprehended	0
agent:unfortunately not completely these days since that's where a lot of their funding is coming from is corporate underwriting|user:yeah|agent:is for the most part they're some what distanced from that but	well	1
agent:yeah|user:oh good yeah i'm not that mu[ch]- i've gone about i guess about twenty twenty five times|agent:to uh see if i can work on my swing a little bit	no i'm not a beginner but i'm not a [laughter-novice] [laughter-either]	1

user:sometimes we have uh family get togethers probably every oh|user:but i would say that every uh couple of weeks uh we're together with one of the you know one of the kids|agent:um-hum	couple of months	0
agent:we might even overcompensate|user:uh-huh|agent:we miss that environment but and i think partly because of that because our family's a thousand miles away	um-hum	1
user:um|agent:and no children so we had Caribbean vacations and new cars and expensive cars down to|agent:um i mean our lifestyle changed drastically we went from two incomes	right	1
agent:that maybe one parent will go off with one child and another parent will go off with the other children|user:um-hum|agent:that families are spending more fractional time together	um-hum	1
user:i read the paper almost everyday and|user:current events and news so|user:uh	um	0
agent:nope|user:no uh i used to|agent:what about USA Today do you read that one	uh uh the New York Times is my favorite newspaper that's what i grew up with but uh i don't spend the money on it because i know i only	0
user:the|user:i wonder if they use their uh the same ones all the time or if they just grab uh|user:um	best of the Washington Post and the New York Times and they probably have a few syndicated columnists that they rotate	1
user:but um|agent:yeah|user:rely on the paper for is the local news	i i'm finding that [noise]	0
user:well it's actually it's on a couple of times it's on channel two at|user:ten o'clock|agent:now um when does that come on	seven i think and it's on channel thirteen at uh ten o'clock usually	1
user:um|user:that['s]- that's what i tune to regularly|agent:oh really	KRLD if i need to	0
user:[laughter] right|user:[laughter]|agent:see you have a shorter commute so that's why you get to stay home and read the paper in the morning [laughter] me i [laughter-just] [laughter-have] to rely on the TV or the um the newspaper i mean th[e]- or the	right	1
agent:well um it was family owned and everything so we didn't like th[e]- the way a lot of the stuff was run there|user:uh-huh|agent:oh really	was it a weekly	1
user:uh-huh|user:uh-huh|agent:yes [laughter-actually]	well that['s]-	1
agent:uh-huh well we're not all like that um|user:talking to a New Yorker i thought that i'd hear someone who was totally for gun control|user:[laughter]	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:um-hum|user:and you know guns were a fact of life|agent:ah	uh my granddad hunted and what not you you mentioned uh	1

agent:and um|user:is that right|agent:card carrying [laughter-um] it's about uh i think it was renewed for the second or third time	my ex was a long term member of the NRA	1
user:a lot more time than the average father with his kid i mean he took his kids out|user:was gladdest about in in the relationship that he was in before that uh he spent like|user:he was talking about that the thing that he	um	0
agent:travel in a wide social circle but it's my impression that a lot of people today a lot of men are are trying to change uh anyway|agent:you know it's it's hard to say i don't|agent:and i	i think it has been changing over the generations you know i see my granddad	0
agent:attached to mom and when i say i love you you know he says i hate you|agent:who you know goes through periods were he's particularly|agent:yeah actually i've heard a lot of that from uh my son	[laughter]	1
agent:um-hum|user:i don't know if individual ownership|user:maintained in a a certain location i don't know but	is necessary	0
user:a lot of people would come back and say well uh|user:yeah mostly i guess handguns a[re]- are create the problems but|agent:but	you they need it for shooting range and that sort of thing but	1
agent:yeah and i think even with a total ban there'll always be guns available|user:so without a total ban there's always going to be guns available|agent:um-hum	but	1
agent:that's right but you know it's interesting there was an incident here in Rochester a a few days ago where uh some people were having a real heavy argument and the guy pulled out a knife and killed the other two people|agent:that's right|user:uh you know they had some kind of disagreement or whatever and next thing you knew he was shot and dead	um-hum	1
user:uh low ratio of of children to to care giver|user:i uh i- i had to go back to work i wanted to find someplace with a very|user:about nine weeks or so	so that the so that my infant could	0
user:and we switched over to|user:quite a number of of demands on her time|user:so that they were really now	to a uh a commercial day care service	0
user:it's really true|user:uh your child looks like maybe he has conjunctivitis come get your child immediately whether or not|agent:yeah	uh come get your child immediately uh it and that's it's it is a big disruption uh it's particularly bad in the first year	0
agent:well that's an interesting yeah|user:out of their hospital facilities|user:as a way of defraying their costs they run day cares for sick children	but	1
agent:uh okay uh i've got a PC|user:course [laughter]|agent:sure i do don't you	a[ll]- right	1
user:i you know i was into|user:and to human factors and i uh|user:well actually uh i just go with the times and and actually	when i was in college i had a	0
agent:oh rea[lly]- you did your dissertation with Hypercard|user:and i needed to use that for my dissertation work|agent:uh-huh	yeah so i didn't i had to uh use uh i didn't have access to computers at work very easily everyone was wanting to use it so i	0
agent:that's when i decided that a PC was like re[ally]- was more cost effective even though it was the inferior product|user:um-hum|agent:when i started like uh investigating the cost of software	um-hum	1
user:um-hum|user:[noise]|user:uh-huh	uh	1
user:like about a hundred and fifty people [noise] before they could actually|user:although i uh i did have a chance at a criminal one they uh actually had to interview|user:this was uh all civil	uh get together a jury because there had been so much publicity about it but uh i was not selected for that one i would have been interesting i think	1
agent:incident and award large damages that were really undeserving from a legal point of view|agent:uh any of the legal aspects of the|user:and it meant um-hum	right	1
user:and when you got right down to it|user:that bothered me was the fact that i was holding in my hands possibly the life of that individual|user:so it's it's really tough and one of the things when i was on the jury that	uh you i really never knew who was really telling the truth and who wasn't	0
agent:uh all the civic duty yeah|user:it's an awful responsibility but it's like voting and all the other things that we're responsible for it's|agent:so i[t]- it uh it ge[ts]-	one of those things you have to do i guess	1
user:[laughter]|agent:i don't know|user:um-hum	right	1
user:the uh|user:um-hum|agent:that that they should even have that option for for such a small amount that our founding fathers didn't understand the economic principles involved	right	1
agent:my family was [vocalized-noise] they were okay because_1 i mean my dad uh he um was in the military and then he also had like two other jobs so we lived comfortably i'd say but|agent:i|agent:well i	uh-huh	1
user:you know|user:and i never actually checked to see if my balance matched the bank's and the other day i was well a couple months ago i started thinking|agent:yeah	i should really do that [laughter]	0
agent:um for the most part yeah i i i've got a real good banker uh personal bankers i mean if if i do if i am ever overdrawn she always calls and tells me|user:does your balance ma[tch]- balance match the banks at the at the end of the month|agent:i just don't want to write bad [laughter-checks]	uh-huh	1
agent:[laughter] how long were you hanging around for|agent:uh|user:well i guess i had to wait a long time till they found somebody	[laughter]	1
user:i'm kind of um [noise]|agent:what about yourself|user:yeah i uh well [vocalized-noise]	waffling i don't know i	0
agent:deserves to be uh punished|agent:they uh the person that perpetuates the crime|agent:you know because_1 as you stated earlier there are some crimes that's so barbaric	um-hum	1
user:um|user:if uh if you don't execute sick people|user:well but um	for acting out their sickness	1
user:i don't know i don't know whether you can you know morally take the power of the state|agent:well then|user:amateur lobotomies i mean is obviously not rational	to end that guy's life	0
agent:and those are the people you probably read about all the time in the news you know somebody's somebody's trying to you know get rid of evolution or something and|user:um-hum|agent:uh a lot of people take religious exemptions	[noise] yeah	1
agent:the oldest one the eight year old|agent:a[nd]-|user:the four year old	oh uh-huh	1
agent:in uh the home schoolers associations there that just they were just blatant cheaters [laughter-and] [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] if their kid didn't do well yeah i mean they just filled it out themselves it was absurd you know|agent:i mean that testing can be really bogus you know because_1 we knew people|user:yeah	[laughter]	1
user:right|agent:t[o]- you know my opinion is that they should there should be a public school they they shouldn't make everybody go to it i mean you should be able to go to other schools or if you know if people have the credentials to home school well leave them_1 alone but|agent:oh actually we didn't really begrudge that you know because_1 i mean it's like you know [vocalized-noise] me i mean it's g[ood]- it's good that uh	uh	1
user:all all substances the|user:you know a a general question is|user:to me uh a general uh uh	particular question in my mind is uh	0
agent:um-hum|user:yes alcohol is uh one of the most and|agent:that's true of lots and lots of things	when i was growing up uh	1
agent:um-hum|user:i kind of thought well this is a strict house and|user:off limits and at the time i	then as i grew older uh in	0
agent:question|user:yeah that was a definite opening for the|agent:yes it's definitely the do as i say not as i do	for the you do your thing and i'll do mine	0
user:and if they have to spot the occasional user in the process and and when i say extreme i mean they can you can go from|user:the drug testing in my mind is is really to spot the extreme user|user:uh how should i say it it has to be traditionally accepted that	[noise] from little or nothing to to extreme very quickly	0
agent:that doesn't effect their job performance|agent:yeah but you know i[t]- it i i think there's a broader issue there is does a company have a right to know something about a person|user:uh friend's parents fits	uh and i you know	0
user:that i think it does effect performance and|user:uh the problem is|user:but uh	and	1
agent:i'm getting used to calling them that since they're all prepared for their birthdays|user:um-hum|agent:yeah we have two we have uh a four year old and a two year old at least they will be in April	[laughter]	1
agent:[noise] uh younger kids uh early teens|agent:it's not that we don't trust but we just don't feel comfortable with uh|agent:because of the ages we don't really	um-hum	0
agent:yeah and that was you know after three years but she just has|user:oh really|agent:and we were asking Denise one time well how much do you pay for babysitters she goes i don't know i've only paid one [laughter-once]	wow	1
user:two boys that lived uh right next door to me they uh|user:my job pretty much my junior year in high school was sitting uh for|user:my	and i d[id]- i did that everyday	1
agent:choosing not to to have her on a regular basis making a conscious decision and|agent:we ended up uh|agent:but	right	1
agent:different attitude towards child rearing|agent:uh different|agent:just different value systems and	um-hum yeah my my father's girlfriend um	1
user:United States space program to|user:for the uh|user:uh limitations on what could be done but it it seemed like a perfect opportunity	uh at least offer to get involved with them in in	0
user:although i guess uh|agent:um-hum|user:halt	certain logic could be [laughter-applied] to figure out how much spending	0
agent:n[ow]- now that's only one side of the story you know i'm sure if you ask someone from McDonald Douglas they would tell you there's|agent:is minimal but|agent:in the amount of information that can be gathered is	oh really	1
user:yeah i agree i think that's definitely been worth while and like you said it's very cost effective and|agent:and tha[t's]-|user:yeah	probably yields as much information as as having somebody actually up there	0
agent:so so four five years ago you had someone|user:i think that was the case|user:uh that you had a recent uh just like about_1 four five years ago	or i i think California had a uh	0
user:um|user:certain crimes um i think they ought to|user:yeah i i i feel sort of in favor of you know for	like y[ou]- you i think you should have one appeal	0
agent:they're getting people through but does it still cost a lot of money to do all this|user:um-hum|agent:i don't know i don't know if it's any better uh i mean Florida has more executions but i don't know if it's any better down there than i[f]- if the process is is any better i mean	yeah	1
user:some of these guys you know it's just like uh|user:yeah some uh|agent:that they're just going to have trouble o[n]- on a lot of these	you know a dog that's got rabies or not rabies but just a dog that goes around biting people you know you just	0
user:you know just course it it probably have to be pretty bad crimes i would think but|user:and and uh|agent:i agree	you know there's a l[ot]- plenty of them_1 out there you know	1
agent:yeah i mean we we have so many things on our ballots here in California to increase the jail size and it's just so much crime that's going on now|user:[laughter] i think we can spend the money you know better elsewhere|agent:it's like Jes[us]- [noise]	[laughter]	1
user:after i graduate i don't know how it would be set up|user:[noise] oh sure i guess this sort of relevant for me because_1 i'm a college student so you know i would have been affected by it you know a couple years ago i guess probably or|agent:[noise]	um i have sort of mixed feelings about the whole thing i mean i think it would sort of be	1
user:um for everyone in the country sort of|user:worthwhile work|user:uh y[ou]- you know it's a it's a small program and i don't know whether they could find	uh and also you know and still still manage it well i think they might be tempted for example to	1
agent:[noise] items that have been contracted out and paid for and th[at]- that in the end hadn't been built to specifications all kinds of stuff like that that was really disturbing|agent:and they'd been through many times before|agent:but before i left i saw those very same radios rotate through again	hm	1
user:waste of people's time|user:i don't know i mean i i think if if it could be made to work well it would be a good idea if it would just be sort of a giant|user:so i yeah i	then i think it would be you know exactly that a waste of time and money	1
user:yeah i think they have that tendency|agent:passed its tenth birth date but|agent:it was quite reliable when it was less than ten years old it started to get a little bit less reliable once it	i've got a Ford Ranger that i drive and uh	0
agent:um-hum|user:the the truck has not been too bad to me|agent:um	but	0
agent:no no no no Gainesville i know Or[lando]- Orlando aren't they about an hour and a half drive|user:oh you mean Minneapolis' a long way|agent:yeah	two two and a half	1
agent:yeah|user:and engine repairs things that had to be done|user:no this is strictly uh structural	like new new transmission [laughter-things] [laughter-like] [laughter-that]	0
agent:and just didn't feel that it provided the kind of quality care that that we want for our child at this point|agent:we tried to use the child care facility at the tennis club that we belong to|agent:well y[es]- uh yes in fact we have had a uh a minor problem we've	um-hum	1
agent:right|user:and do you put chil[d]- child in day care some[where]- along that lines|user:make ends meet	and the reality is that we'll probably have to have a child	0
user:it's used specifically and only for day care|agent:right|user:um and they it's you're reimbursed out of that out of that funds provided	it's probably one of the few programs that i've seen	0
agent:day care and [laughter-i] [laughter-just] [laughter-tell] [laughter-her] [laughter-that] you know it's just it's not a matter of choice for most people we're fortunate we we have a choice|agent:to uh|user:what's	you know most people i know who have had to make that decision	0
agent:yeah|user:as she dreads that date too i imagine|agent:[laughter]	but i[t]- uh unfortunately it is a reality you just can't get by without	0
user:oh you go skiing eh|agent:and i go skiing that's about it [laughter]|user:yeah what do	yeah well out here in the west you've got some nice places to go skiing	1
agent:yeah|user:so you like regularly do volleyball|agent:so that's regular	yeah i used to i used to regularly run and then about a year and a half ago i had some back problems	1
agent:great|user:no|agent:running that doesn't bother your knees at all	no i've never had problems with my knees at all	1
agent:well it's hard to get no exercise while running i mean you pretty much got to move don't you|user:run around together and it's not like we go real hard or anything but it's enjoyable|user:we jog and like kind of just go see places and kind of	oh yeah well you do i mean it's it's really jogging but i mean you can push yourself at different levels how hard you run	1
agent:but that's good exercise|agent:but|agent:just uh	um	1
agent:yeah it was all urine testing|user:were they like urine tests or were they bloo[d]-|agent:regular random uh drug testing for that as well that i actually had to sign an agreement saying that uh	um-hum	1
agent:an invasion of your privacy and uh that sort of thing|agent:i guess so there's uh still a good bit of discussion and controversy about whether it's|agent:right exactly	yeah	1
agent:it but yet if tha[t's]- that's in any kind of a computer database [laughter] somebody's going to get access to it that and uh real easy to abuse so|agent:yeah and it's|user:yes th[at]- th[at]- that stuff should be kept confidential far as that goes	it's accessible that's right	1
agent:[noise]	i'll start	1
user:[laughter-okay] is that|agent:[laughter-um-hum]|user:so there's a fundamental problem	y[ou]- you get into this to impose your will upon others	0
user:um there was a time when the government wouldn't think of um|user:the governm[ent]- wou[ldn't]- wouldn't think of telling you what you could eat or smoke|user:um there was a time when	imposing heavy taxes on transportations o[n]- on your means of transportation to uh build uh roads where they wanted them	0
agent:um-hum|user:um i hope it happens peacefully|agent:um-hum	because it will happen	1
agent:with your TV set and you feel that a fitting punishment for|user:with your TV set yeah|agent:well then the question is so he's climbing out the window	um	1
user:you know it's it's it's it's y[ou]- y[ou]- you it's it's a um|user:yeah one way or another um so when material objects are destroyed|agent:right and you're pay for it eventually	how can i better say it	0
user:okay you're moving|user:you're just moving stuff from one place to another|user:um you're not creating anything	some kind of uh you know if if you um	0
user:well|agent:i don't think one pers[on]- one adult should have like twenty children to keep after|agent:and so on	well do you think that how many children do you think they should be allowed	1
user:well i think that|agent:and so it saves the company money it's in the company's best interest|agent:uh paid holiday to take care of their children	really am i am	0
user:and um|user:his baby got sick in child care|user:a case where um	all the babies at the child care place that he went to	0
user:uh-huh|agent:much different situation than we had even three years ago you know|user:what do you think is uh	well you know we	0
user:and are the gangs uh|user:uh-huh|agent:enough that you know which one's you pretty well pick out which ones are in the gang type	selling are they in enterprise are they selling drugs is that one of the reasons for gangs	1
agent:uh realizing that they have to start in the primary grades|agent:i do but uh us all that basis that they start but i i think they're pr[obably]- finally|user:right and i think that's an effective program	um-hum	1
agent:that they've come in with all of those|user:uh-huh|agent:right but that's all recent you know that's all been in the last three about_1 four years	right	1
agent:uh-huh|user:[noise] talk about home repairing i understand|agent:[noise]	di[d]- have you had any recent experience	1
agent:and they're heavy too you don't think about how heavy it is|agent:oh boy|user:and all my clothes were on the floor and i said oh my word [laughter] oh yes they're very heavy	and um	0
agent:six hundred dollars|user:they wanted to charge me six hundred dollars to replace the side door and i thought no you're not|agent:um	i'm not paying six hundred dollars	1
user:and uh so i mean|agent:yeah that's kind of yeah that would|user:had made it so that nobody [laughter-could] [laughter-get] [laughter-in] because they put two by fours over it and nailed it shut	if they wanted to get in they would have had to use a mac truck to get through the bars	1
user:um-hum|agent:the local home stores here and uh i'm sure that you can pick them_1 up down there but it's a really uh the way they put them_1 together it's really not hard at all to put them put them in it takes about an afternoon it was a Sunday afternoon you know and|agent:they have all sorts and uh you know they sell them_1 in our	um-hum um-hum	1
agent:or do anything that's a little ou[t]- out of the ordinary they get really thrown|user:uh-huh|agent:so if you start asking questions right away	oh i see	1
user:but|agent:yeah well another thing you can do is you can pretend that you got them on call waiting|user:and see how long yeah see how long they'll wait	yeah	1
user:right|agent:uh if i want to move money around over the phone or check my balance or anything the pin number they want is the last four digits of the social security|agent:yeah and those are used as pin numbers a lot like with my bank uh	exactly	0
agent:yeah because_1 they cou[ld]-|user:but the the police reader could get more information you might say|user:but the yeah but in other words so they can ver[ify]- they can go in and and get the card and get information off it	but i i just i d[on't]- i i don't like the i[dea]- i don't like the idea of business	0
user:yeah|user:i see|agent:and at home as Tad Cook	yeah i have an account at school so i'm able to do that	1
agent:[noise] <b_aside> tell you what this is later [laughter] <e_aside>	[noise]	1
agent:uh do you have a do you have a minimum requirement for your community service is there a commitment like a term commit[ment]-|user:i do you know like one weekend a month type thing|agent:[noise]	no	1
user:they'll rebel on it and at least the ones i've seen|user:if you can if you can f[ind]- help them to find their niche you know they'll they'll really grow to love it but if you force them_1 in to something that they're not real keen on|user:and um	you know and and they a[nd]- they they struggle against it and they want out of it as fast as they can	1
agent:a little more conducive i think to a to a fellowship feel in that c[ould]- they could draw a support from|user:um-hum|agent:because of that isolation [noise] even if they were in teams it would be [noise]	right	1
user:and you could do as little or as much|user:and it could just be like an extracurricular club that you could become involved in|user:you know the way i got into mine was they did it it they started it in junior high school	and you decided how much involvement that you got	0
user:um|user:right well that's true|agent:does making of going over[board]- o[verboard]- overboard almost	and and it one other thing you've got to really look at is uh depending on what age group you're going to involve you know be it high school or whatever you've got to have good adult mentors	0
agent:oh i bet she just uh was pleased|user:sixty five|agent:wow how old was she	oh yeah she	0
agent:grandkids|user:uh|user:well we just had uh just immediate family just uh the kids and	yeah my well what it was was just	1
agent:was speechless for about fifteen or twenty minutes|agent:she just|user:[noise]	[noise] yeah	1
user:[noise]|agent:our side of the family really is pretty spread out so we we're [vocalized-noise] we have to uh|agent:we ha[ve]- our uh	[noise]	1
user:yeah|agent:and it it it's too bad you can't|agent:we ought to do this twice a year we had so much fun	yeah	0
user:that's right|agent:to do it myself then it would for uh i mean that's the reason [laughter] i mean it|agent:it's also you know it's also getting to the point where i'm sitting there saying well gee unless i am really enjoy doing this th[is]- it's costing me more money	you better you better enjoy doing it or else it's not really worth it	0
user:but i looked into getting that replaced and that was going to cost a fair amount of money because i would have to take it to the uh dealer|user:[noise] yeah|agent:yeah the the the other things you always do oh geez shoot [laughter]	who would put a factory replacement part on and then charge me fifty bucks and hour to do the work	0
user:and everything was fine i also have power windows and i had to have the window down to do what i was doing|agent:right|user:yeah it was more than i really wanted to do and then i got it i finally got it all apart figured out what i had to do and i put the mirror on and i got it plugged in and i put the door back together	an[d]- oh no i'm sorry i had to have the window up to do what i was doing and i went to uh	1
user:yeah|user:oh yeah|agent:now that one i you know it act[ually]- they actually said to go in and get the service person to do that too and i said well forget that	[laughter]	1
user:[laughter]|agent:right and then but then the lights are still out [laughter] so you're not sitting there going i can't see [laughter]|agent:all right	now i think my m[echanic]- mechanic found a way to do that there's a switch somewhere that you can push that uh pop the light up without turning it on	0
agent:right y[eah]-|user:yep that's right or unless it's high enough off the ground that you can crawl underneath it|agent:there's no way anyone could get in there unless they could take the car and put it up into the air	but that's not usually easy either	1
agent:um-hum|user:topics you're interested in because you really you can project say a you know uh|user:that way what you do is that you find what	a s[ay]-	1
agent:you they don't have any work experience or whatever maybe they've taken some classes in high school or something like that i think the advice you give i[s]- is excellent for that i think on the other hand there are there are st[udent]- there are students out there who know what they want to take|user:right|agent:i might differ with or or maybe we would agree on this is that uh i think there's some i think there some kids who who probably don't really know what they want to take	right	1
user:is that|user:but a[nother]- another thing and this is i think is really important|agent:um-hum	the college hype okay	0
agent:um-hum|user:and you just you just really didn't have any you know any rights and you just just it's just really structure like that and so|agent:okay	one of my main suggestions would be to	0
agent:that'd be handy in college|agent:oh i see|user:information i have on computers [laughter] i think i'd it would be good for me to have a laptop computer f[or]- for for college	but um basically my knowledge is limited [laughter]	1
agent:uh-huh|agent:hum|user:i i joke around about being a mechanic on the printers i uh [laughter] i dropped uh one of the pa[per]- the paper holder on that that connects to the printer	on the floor the other day in my boss's office	0
agent:j[ust]- i just finished Ballad of Baby Doe|agent:yeah i'm in about four operas a year up here and we're|user:that's great	uh-huh	1
agent:um-hum|user:oh okay see what i'm i want to do is uh get my Bachelor's in music theory|agent:[noise] i think she wants to do that she also sings in a chorus	possibly music theory	1
agent:um-hum|user:Disneyland or whatever|user:uh see these you know really nice things and they were not the typical things like Florida or	was more like Colorado for the mountains or something like that	1
agent:they had kids|agent:they're they were still a a a single people but uh|agent:it was like they were single but	right	1
agent:[noise] people at work [laughter] uh [laughter]|user:um ha[ve]- have you uh have you uh worked around kids quite a bit|agent:[vocalized-noise]	[laughter]	1
agent:i i'm i'm beyond [laughter-this] and i'm acting just like they are|agent:[laughter] and i said wait a minute wait a minute|user:[laughter]	you	0
user:yeah yep|agent:uh parents today are it's they want everything if if it can't be done in five minutes don't bother me with it|agent:yeah it's it's it's just	no a[ttention]- no attention span	0
agent:yeah the accused|user:the defendant|user:or the i guess the criminal you can't say they're criminal yet but they would be the uh	the accused right and if you um	1
user:i uh|user:okay yeah i understand|agent:then it's the government doing the complaining and that sounds political to me	a[ctually]- actually f[or]- my perception is that most people having having to do with those things you mentioned seems like they tend to get off most of the time	1
agent:the federal government just grows and it seems like that the only way to restrain it is to restrain the increase in taxes if taxes are increased uh the government finds a way to spend it even you know given even that despite the fact that we have a budget deficit|agent:well of course part of the problem is that that um|user:hum	yeah absolutely	1
agent:and they have a government contract to do work on some computer for the Navy i'm not sure what it's called [vocalized-noise] called but it's some uh military standard architecture with a with a sixteen bit address space i mean they're still working with a sixteen bit address space and they're writing all their software to overlay programs into this sixteen bit address space rather than going to something that was you know modern fifteen years ago|user:uh-huh|agent:another thing that that that that that reminds me of is um I was talking to people who work at AT&T Gilford Center	uh no	1
user:think that uh hunting is a legitimate use for weapons and uh i also sort of believe that|user:but i also|user:um i don't like the idea of you know anyone being able to just sort of go up to a store and buy a hand gun for about uh you know forty dollars or whatever and go out and shoot someone	[noise] although you know certainly our government is is very nice now i[t]- it probably doesn't hurt this sort of ultimate back up to have some so[me]- citizens to have guns if for some reason	1
agent:and i and as far as hunting i'm su[re]- you know this is the same thing|agent:exactly|user:yeah i agree completely there should be a waiting period and they should be able to do a background check on you	yeah i mean most	1
agent:that's true|agent:[noise]|user:cause trouble with handguns aren't the sort to care what the law is [laughter-anyway]	um	0
user:um|agent:hum-um because they're always going to be able to get them_1|user:something to be aware of that it probably would not be the the ultimate solution that would solve all crime problems	yeah	0
user:at Rice uh|user:i do uh uh another student who i didn't know personally|user:but uh	but uh it's not that s[mall]- that uh [laughter] large a community uh [laughter-about] a week ago	0

user:and doesn't really go much indepth|agent:[noise]|user:actually for indepth information the news[paper]- newspaper is definitely better uh because the television just presents highlights	can't really because they don't have the time	1
user:sort of of|user:yeah|agent:read your newspaper over breakfast and	[noise] sort of a relaxing time	1
user:where they gi[ve]- every ten minutes they give traffic information|user:so i will tune in to news uh station|agent:uh-huh	and uh	1
user:so the news the n[ews]- the current event news in California is that we had rain yesterday [laughter]|user:i call from a bunch of uh pay ph[one]- pay phones and whatnot|agent:oh	and uh it's sort of a cloudy i would say broken skies mostly almos[t]- not quite overcast but	1
user:okay|agent:oh the shoes are just about the only thing that doesn't get rotated|user:you you ha[ve]- you rotate your shoes around	like brown with um if you wear black with brown pants	1
user:that they're much|user:i think men look very nice i i think|user:well i mean	better off than women are as far as their clothes go	0
user:in the work field if she's single she dresses|user:and she of course|user:a husband	you know	1
user:uh i th[ink]- i think even the men uh men are offended by that too|user:i don't know how they [laughter-feel] [laughter-about] [laughter-it] but it surely doesn't|user:and um	if it's not	0

agent:i see i see|user:just belting them out|agent:yes	uh s[ound]- you sound like you probably are down in the uh	0
agent:yes|agent:yes|agent:uh	trying think where there was something interesting or unique because i think it depends a lot more on	0
agent:[noise]|user:[noise] well Allen do you think that uh all our politicians are totally dishonest	or are they just making mistakes like their uh banking business	1
user:but|user:yeah but|user:[noise]	have you been to Washington	1
agent:use their influence in not always the most positive ways|agent:i think that's a greater problem because they're constantly trying to|user:well	yes that's true i i think they do things that make it easier for our	0
agent:uh [laughter-no] [laughter-thanks]|user:well run for office [laughter]|user:huh	yeah the[y]-	0
agent:[noise]	[noise]	1
user:you know they didn't|user:um|user:you know by then it was it was kind of uh	explain up front that that might be a requirement but it sounded like it was kind of sprung on them by the uh firms they had contracts with	1
agent:you know what's going on in my body to the degree that it affects how i am doing my job and|agent:concern about|agent:the employee um the employer has	uh-huh	1
agent:you know what i do with myself or if if i smoke fifteen joints or something and i hit|user:right|agent:it's none of their business	um-hum	1
agent:that would really negatively affect my performance|agent:you know th[ere]- th[ere]- there's so many things i mean if if i were going through a divorce for instance which is something a lot of people experience|agent:it's	yeah	1
user:the way i see it in the in the last article i read was|user:the way um|user:[noise] well um as far as the as far as spending goes	that i think US ought to spend the same amount of money that we're spending but i think the states need to take	0
agent:i wasn't aware that there was a very large uh gay community in Texas|user:and it's just not taking advantage of the money that's being provided|user:because the state that i'm in has is the fourth largest in AIDS cases	well there's w[ell]- well we have we have our o[wn]- you know that we have i guess a fair share	0
agent:clout and pressure|agent:and i think a lot of it's just due to political|user:um-hum	well also because it's so new	0
user:that's true|agent:for some reason in this case no one's really willing to give them a chance|agent:uh major advances that we have today are are done by private industry but	i hadn't i hadn't thought about that	1
user:you know and so i mean it's it's very difficult to put a cure on something that you keep expanding|agent:sure|user:i know just in the last three months the CDC has come back and redefined AIDS	and we kee[p]- you know and all the new um you know things that we keep finding you know that you can be HIV positive for you know now what	0
agent:so i'm|agent:um well i have worked in family practice which in large part was pediatrics|user:pediatrics	i	1
user:yeah i i it is i i um|user:uh|agent:hm [laughter] none that you're [laughter-aware] well that's our topic right [laughter]	uh i don't know i have i have my own opinions on the on the subject it's kind of	0
user:hey there you go|agent:doesn't matter if i agree or not oh [laughter]|agent:you can tell me i've	um	0
agent:yeah|user:if somebody would at least [vocalized-noise] i don't know it's|agent:i'm sure their kids would be much better served if	it's rough and i think that there's a	1
agent:yeah there's no way|user:and uh|agent:oh	and uh they	1
agent:that's correct|user:follows it's [vocalized-noise] flow|user:your life sort of	so um how are the benefits set up are they set up like they are in the federal government or are they	1
user:um-hum|agent:the choose choice of doctors if you take their you know they have one of these cafeteria plans so you you either choose the HMO or you choose the um i guess blue cross and blue shield is who they have now|user:ability to choose	um-hum	1
user:eighties|user:l[aw]- the especially during the seventies and|user:and i kind of had exactly the same experience uh	law firms were just rolling in the money	0
user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	so what do you think of the current jury system	1
agent:it's|agent:variation there it's not just did they do it or didn't they do it|agent:right yeah there's a lot more	so i don't quite like the idea of the in civil trials in sounds like in a lot places the jury comes up with what the award amount should be	0
user:and i also think ye[ah]-|agent:help anybody except the lawyers who'd get their cut of it their half|agent:and uh wouldn't really	on the same lines the uh punitive damage awards	0
agent:the uh|user:yes yes [laughter]|agent:i guess it's off the topic we're supposed to be discussing but	and the other thing i guess that was in there was whether the	1
user:really believe that other people would have the right for someone to under go a blood test without their explicit consent|user:in that i don't|user:that uh first of all people are innocent until proven guilty and secondly that th[ere]- in some sense there's a sort of sanctity of the body issue	so i think that pretty much clearly leads me to my con[viction]- conviction that i i do not believe that uh	0
user:and uh in the case of driving it's not a|user:okay [noise] well i maybe i should qualify mine and and mention of course there are some legal parameters that need to be observed as well|user:[noise]	i[t]- it's a privilege to drive and there's certain things that go along with it but even then they don't force you to take any kind of test if you simply don't take the test then you just you know	1
agent:i'd say it's pretty much it's uh right to privacy the individual can do whatever they want as long as they don't negatively impact other individuals it is then that negative impact that should be looked at not the uh not the direct cause of it|user:circumstances like driving is that what you're trying to say|user:except for in certain	[noise]	1
user:so we had to redo everything on the inside we've painted all the walls|user:-[a]bout two or three years ago and it was about to be repossessed and the people that lived in this house were real filthy they had animals and they smoked and it was just a real dirty house|agent:me too	uh redone the floors completely because_1 the carpet was destroyed	0
agent:of six million screws well there were six million screws|user:[laughter-uh-huh]|agent:i joked about the bag of screws	uh-huh	1
agent:that one wasn't so bad as much as tiling the floor of the bathroom where|agent:it was|agent:but um	[laughter]	1
agent:not difficult difficultly uh not really difficult it's just|agent:and it's|agent:yeah i i i find it enjoyable uh	uh-huh	1
agent:so i went up to the store and i found the one that had the forty horsepower motor attached to the fan|user:[laughter]|agent:it's it's pushing the smoke back into the room	uh-huh	1
agent:uh what range of colleges they should go to|agent:once you find out why they want to go to college then you can get a better idea of|user:um-hum	uh-huh	1
agent:um-hum|user:possible to understand what what you child would desire|user:and um [vocalized-noise] you know it'd be good to even to start as early as	and and determine a goal some point uh before like the last moment [laughter]	0
user:you know you could always shoot for those places that don't ha[ve]- you know are [vocalized-noise] that might be considered out of your range but|user:um but people you know you want to try to match their needs as best they can and then if|user:though it's probably more so now than used to be	sometimes you might be able to get a scholarship or whatever have you so i wouldn't rule them out	0
user:i think there's things like student uh faculty ratios and|user:and uh|user:yeah	and uh	0
agent:and um|user:oh yeah uh-huh|agent:are actually easier to get into if you have pretty good grades of course it's not quite so comparative to say the Ivy League schools	yeah they also tend not to be as well endowed and they also have	1
user:his speaking i- i- i hear a|user:he does i- i- i from just|agent:yeah but he does raise some interesting points like	a v[ery]-	0
agent:and mismanagement|agent:get rid of the fraud|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:um if uh you know we we say the president can be limited to two terms and we don't limit|user:um-hum|agent:a viable way to cut the amount of money we spend in government	um-hum	1
user:well then you have you have President Bush going over to Japan to try to|agent:are they going to balance a trillion plus dollar budget|user:[vocalized-noise]	do some wrangling over there to for the trade deficit and they send the send the top	0
user:you know i- i-|agent:out of business and away from business and out of everybody's hair|agent:we need to get government out of	i me[an]- i agree with you to	0
agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	go ahead [laughter]	1
agent:that uh|user:oh absolutely [noise] as a matter of fact i believe that the safety and and health uh issues|agent:supervision and training that	uh depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children	1
user:and then [noise]|agent:um-hum|user:young kids below the age of six	um and then of course to make up for that um the uh parents would have to work in their later years longer i[n]- in other words they probably would not work	1
user:all you have to do is have a sharp mind and i believe that uh mental acuity is|agent:that's exactly right [vocalized-noise]|user:what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work	easy to sustain	0
agent:gets a little annoying|agent:is uh|user:[laughter]	yeah	1
agent:he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes|user:[laughter]|agent:Mi[chael]- Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he	oh yeah	1
agent:and feel that if if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time|agent:of people who are really into classical music|agent:uh some classical music and what gets me even more is the attitude	[laughter]	1
agent:we'll do the ninth and everyone will know it and and hum it|user:[laughter]|agent:you know we're we're much better off playing uh Beethoven's ninth that's right you know w[e'll]- we'll do	it's safe	1
agent:uh well yeah well it depends on what you're say[ing]- yeah that i guess|user:uh basically we've been out this at this for what about thirty five years|user:kind of disappointed by the way things have been going	from the first experimental	1
agent:well i think that uh satellites now that is a that is a market where there's a a|user:there seems to be some spectacular progress happening there|user:the commercial end of satellite operations um	and uh	1
agent:resources across the world i mean i- i we're coming out to a global global economy anyways|agent:i mean we have um|agent:oh well be[cause]-	um-hum	1
user:and you're three or four competitors and you're debating whether to um|agent:right|user:you know i don't know about i'm not going to speculate about research across the board but let's suppose um you were the executive of a company that could possibly have benefit from some space research	throw a couple of billion dollars into it over the next twenty years	1

agent:do you guys have it up there where where'd you say you were from|agent:uh th[e]- you know the family of the victims|agent:but as far as it being an actual deterrent to crime i don't think it is like i said it's mostly for the families benefit i think or the victims	yeah i'm from New Hampshire	1
agent:that's the schoolteacher one|user:when we do have a celebrated case like Pamela Smart i don't know if you heard about that|user:it uh dur[ing]- one thing we don't really have th[at]- that much crime up here	right	1
user:dec[ision]- the decision is final you can't really reverse the [laughter-process]|user:because_1 once you execute some[one]- the the the|user:i think if	um	1
agent:that's right|user:uh whether he's insane or not|agent:that's right	same thing with Dahlmer i mean he	0
agent:[laughter]|agent:[noise]|user:do you think that there's any way that uh or do you think there's too much crime now i mean i guess	any crime is too much but it's	0
agent:that's what i hear|user:commit crimes and|agent:yeah	so it's uh	1
agent:huh|agent:[laughter]|user:but uh they they put her at the end of a hallway there were no other classes going on at the time and they refused to let her wear a body a[larm]- a body alarm	which i know i don't know exactly what that is but i just assume it's something that she could hit immediately and and really annoy a lot of people	0
agent:you can get pretty hardened i'm sure|agent:you know i've i talked to a few people who've worked in prisons and stuff and it's uh|agent:oh	but getting i mean [vocalized-noise] well see i always have problems because because i can never decide whether or not i'm i'm supposed to be a conservative or or a liberal but	0
user:and basically just just|agent:um-hum|user:and use it for uh drug education	attack the problem at the demand side	0
user:uh got married|user:uh yeah i have be[fore]- before i|agent:do you do you wilderness camp	i haven't since i've been married though	1
user:well no not really we just usually kind of go camping and tent and cook and|agent:so now do y'all do you fish and go camp do you take a boat or|user:yeah	and just fish off the shore	1
agent:plus you end up with a fish hooks in your ears and stuff like that [laughter]|user:yeah|agent:i think they might be a little bit more hard to handle too you got to keep them_1 occupied and then	[laughter]	1
user:but|agent:[laughter-he] [laughter-don't] believe me|user:yeah	before i came in the service my dad always took us camping in the Bighorns	1
agent:we went up the on top of this mountain it was a little narrow road|agent:i don't know if i could take that last time we went camping i went with my brother and his wife and|agent:yeah	um-hum	1
agent:are you really|user:i can start i'm actually we're actually trying to find one now because_1 our family's growing yeah|user:okay let's see i guess um	um	1
agent:sort of a sports car i would really like to have a sports car um [noise] i don't really i don't have a family so i don't need a a minivan or such to uh [noise] haul people around in|agent:right it is um i'm kind of right now the next car i buy is gonna be|user:a design problem there	um-hum	1
agent:uh-huh|user:and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton|agent:uh-huh	it's you know we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles but	1
agent:[vocalized-noise]|agent:right|user:after you know it's after they've used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it and	you can get those for like	0
EMPTY	[noise] uh so uh what are your benefits like at your job and how do you feel about them	1
agent:four years or five years it's pretty soon you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything|agent:the best thing and a lot of the stuff the best thing is like|agent:yeah and	uh-huh	1
agent:it's fabulous|agent:that's not the case so i [laughter] guess nothing|user:uh-huh	wow	1
user:and uh|user:for law firms here in Washington|agent:uh-huh	at that time i was in gravy city	0
agent:yeah|user:but uh it could be better that's for sure and|user:um	uh [noise] but you know there there are other things that you get when you work for the government i- uh	0
agent:uh-huh|agent:yeah|agent:oh yeah	and uh the work that he he's uh specifically an engineer and and does work with uh	0
user:needless to say here in Washington DC [laughter] this is the war zone|user:well|user:[laughter]	uh DC around here stands for drug capital or death capital	0
agent:uh but it's on the uprise especially in a lot of the uh outlying agricultural towns|user:uh-huh|agent:relatively low on violent crime	uh-huh	1
user:uh crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing|user:and uh n[ow]- nowadays the latest thing i've i've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as|agent:[laughter-yeah]	uh cars like at night breaking into them or whatever	0
user:[noise]|agent:yeah there aren't that many places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays|user:and uh which is an entirely different environment so this is a whole new thing for [noise] for us to to have to put up with and it's uh really scary sometimes	right	0
agent:it's illegal but it's not wrong because all their friends do it|user:understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised|user:yeah and their friends are driving Mercedes and so it's actually they grow up with that as their way of life and uh i think uh to a large extent they don't	right [laughter] exactly so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes and they	0
user:well i mean|agent:i don't know if i'm making any sense or not|agent:in the civil cases	i think are you just trying to say that	1
agent:yeah many laws but little justice|user:there are many cases in our justice system where justice is not served|user:well i mean i think that	say	1
user:um-hum|agent:and they shouldn't be funneled into a mandatory sort of a thing|user:um-hum	um	0
user:well think of it ye[ah]-|agent:you know they'll be sitting there working on the job doing nothing|user:yeah i'm	yeah i- i but i wonder about that the the mere fact that it isn't cost effective do you think that that i[f]- if it's not cost effective do you think that people are going to be enthused about it	1
user:but uh|user:uh kids c[ollege]- uh turning eighteen every year i think it's about that might be a little bit lower now|user:but um [noise] no i- i and it just seems to me that that that once you get everybody involved there's there's what there's eight million is it uh	that's an awful lot to to bring into a program you got to have eight million jobs available you've got to have administrators for eight million jobs that would be tremendously expensive	0
agent:well they did this in uh the depression they invented what the CCC|user:yeah uh i- i grant to that but if that's the case then it needn't the[n]- then you don't have a m[andatory]- you don't need a mandatory program to bring everybody into national service you just need a program for the people that haven't gotten anythi[ng]- gotten anything better to do and i think that might be a good idea although again then you get the kind of people who are likely to sell drugs to their coworkers et cetera|agent:who want to wo[rk]- or too many people who could work and not enough people who can work	right	1
agent:i have a Pontiac six thousand|agent:um|agent:and i have two little girls and	um-hum	1
agent:not get cramped up and fuss you know|agent:move around and|agent:you know	um-hum [laughter]	0

user:well you know it's it's one of those things i mean uh|agent:and what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done has nothing to do with justice whatsoever|user:wow	uh	1
agent:uh that's true i i i think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself|user:uh theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the to the jury and then the judge says oh no d[isregard]- disregard that come on any jury's not going to disregard the evidence you know [laughter]|user:and you know you wouldn't have this uh	[noise] that may very well be	1
user:you know what might very well do uh cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that|user:well you know uh talking about the lawyers|agent:i think somehow you have to separate the revenues from	is to	0
user:oh yeah|agent:heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney and here's this bum that didn't have a job and he's got a attorney that you and i could never afford|agent:when you get the most	yeah	1
user:but recently we started a program i think is getting encourages a lot more participation|user:and basically only the ecologically minded would go to such pa[ins]- places because it's it's a drive out of your way to take things to these|user:recycling has become somewhat in vogue we've always had recycling centers around where you can take in newspapers and bottles and things and put them in the right bin but it's totally voluntary	which is	0
user:so there's the motivation basically your regular garbage you have to pay to get picked up and recyclable stuff if you put it in a recyclable|user:then they'll pick that up for free|user:like newspapers or right now it's limited to i think the newspapers and plastic bottles plastic milk bottles	bin or recyclable uh container they	0
agent:you can say i don't want to recycle and save a dollar and a half a month|agent:but if you don't want to recycle|agent:papers and so on in that all makes sense	oh no	1
EMPTY	[noise]	0
agent:so many cents back for|agent:did they like on bottles did they give you a|agent:did they	i don't really know	0
user:you know|agent:um-hum|user:i bought some Cokes the other day in the br[ead]- the little bottles	and i think the bottles were like	0
agent:uh-huh|user:uh we[ll]- out in this area they really don't have anything now i know that like Minyard's|agent:wi[th]- the green glass yeah it's amazing	and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores they have like four different bins out front	0
user:[laughter] [vocalized-noise]|agent:we all do it [laughter] [noise] well it was nice talking to you|user:[laughter] right i know	it was nice talking to you i have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything	1
user:uh no we're not being tested for drugs at all uh|agent:how about_1 you|user:huh	our	0
user:some quick judgment in the field|user:but i think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise|agent:yeah	what is the nature of your company's business	1
user:i guess i c[an]- i think it's got some relevance but i think its relevance is pretty limited i mean i think|user:you know but um i think drug testing and i- i don't know|agent:[laughter-yeah]	you know in your case i don't think that	0
user:that's|agent:they take a they seem to take a lot of care to make sure they've got the uh the right person whatever for the conviction levied|agent:uh i've served on a few juries and	that's true well certainly Texas uh	1
user:i|agent:is that punishable by death in Texas or is that up to the jury to decide or the judge|user:i doubt that	i don't know	1
user:yeah|user:no uh|agent:that sort of thing even if they're multiple offenders or repeat offenders i- i wouldn't condone capital punishment for that	i- i don't know what the consensus in the state is i know it was it was a few years ago that the Supreme Court struck down capital punishment didn't they didn't they tell the states to go back and review the circumstances	1
user:now you have to care for somebody that you otherwise wouldn't have to i suppose that might actually be a uh|user:not try and make those kind of judgmental errors but that goes and affects the logistical ones in that|user:um	pretty rude way of rude way of looking at it though	1
user:but logistically we just haven't been able to get our act together well enough|user:like nuclear power plants you know it's a great idea|user:can we really do it are we are we that good that we can really do it it's like uh	to	1
user:if they executed anybody on it recently i don't think so|user:[laughter] well Evan uh i suppose they do have the death penalty down here i don't know if um|agent:so what are they doing down in uh Georgia	uh i don't know you know it's gotten to the point where	0
agent:[laughter]|user:not that we need more or anything like that|user:[noise] not that um	[laughter]	1
user:i guess occasionally there's some about harsh stuff one harsh sentence that i kind of liked was uh|user:they're often does seem to be backlash against light things|user:they're	Jim Bakker getting forty five years	1
user:for instance like Social Security tax or Soc[ial]- uh i mean that's that's tax we're paying money and and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that|user:are we getting a reasonable return on on investment|user:i never really thought that that the the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little i i always thought that the the real question was is	when it comes our turn to retire	0
user:i may be wrong but i believe that the cure for polio is already founded but but supposedly once you have an office in DC or you know|user:which|user:that are researching to find a cure for polio	and and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down and and they just haven't yet	1
agent:it it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things|agent:uh|agent:on the other hand uh	yeah	1
user:it's uh|user:[laughter]|agent:and then of course the bottom fell out	i mean it's it's tough i mean there's there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of	1
agent:folk music|user:uh mostly folk music|agent:so what kind of music do you like	yeah i find myself uh listening to a lot of uh	0
user:you know the type of music a[t]-|user:i i didn't like uh they started getting a little more|agent:yeah	at least to me it's uh sounds like it's only sounds good at a high volumes and i don't like listening at high volumes	1
user:uh|user:well there there's a Conway Twitty twang then there's the uh Dolly Parton|agent:[laughter] i i don't care for it at all that Texas twang or whatever you want to call it i	Hollywood sound type	1
agent:yeah generally or about the only new music i hear is somebody else that i know|agent:uh|agent:it's	yeah	1
agent:uh yeah they had[n't]- i don't think they really traded anybody that i know of yet um|agent:do you think|user:i don't know how they'll do this year they'll probably still do pretty good have you uh been keeping up on the people they've been trading or anything	yeah	1
user:but|agent:um-hum|user:he's one of the taller quarterbacks you know most quarterbacks are only about six foot	but uh he's one of the taller ones	1
agent:um-hum|user:they get overconfident in the second half they get ahead in the first half and the second half they just kind of blow it you know|user:oh yeah i i think what one of their problems is is they	and they've done that every season every year	0
agent:really [laughter]|user:oh course uh now i get Sunday and Monday n[ights]- Sunday afternoon and Monday nights are|agent:your wife let you watch uh plenty of football	reserved for me	0
agent:you know they don't do the instant replay and then on the other things you know a touchdown pass or something like that you know they always get out the instant replay and call backs|agent:they just don't|agent:and uh	oh yeah that's kind of	1
user:or a car theft you know it things of that nature very few uh you you assaults although on the college campuses uh there are uh|user:what's more likely to occur is uh robbery of uh you know knocking over a a small store|user:well uh fr[om]- least what from what's on the news uh there are very few like actual robberies reported uh uh of of residences	cases of you know	0
agent:[laughter-there] [laughter-is] [laughter-a] [laughter-crime]|user:now there's a crime for you [laughter]|agent:oh wow	yeah but uh i guess	0
agent:on the street make any money off of it per se you know you gonna only get ten or fifteen bucks for it|agent:if someone do steal a a television or VCR or something like that it is for drugs you know because_1 you really can't|agent:in most cases it's not like uh	yeah	1
agent:[noise]	[noise]	0
agent:um-hum|user:i do|agent:a verdict of guilty or not guilty	i really do	1
agent:uh peers juries by professional judges|agent:by uh|agent:instead of juries just by	um-hum	1
user:it does but|agent:yeah it's uh does carry an implicit danger with it that way|user:the they're split either way	that's kind of goes like our Supreme Court [laughter-in] [laughter-a] [laughter-way]	1
agent:right that's that's a really interesting issue too and um you know most people|user:or a week's pay is your boss willing to let [laughter-you]|agent:[laughter]	yeah	1
agent:um that that helps f[or]- for that planning|agent:uh medical and uh child care uh all together so|agent:um and my my company has a uh a pretax medical deduction	hum until they	0
user:the first year that actually the first month that i've actually instituted a budget|user:yeah this is uh|agent:but we do have uh the things through our companies so that's that's a start anyway	uh for my wife and i	0
user:uh so far it's working out pretty well you know we're keeping an eye on what we spend each week|user:you know with all the monthly bills and uh|agent:[noise]	but like i said	0
agent:fantasizing about can't do it right now our situation is that we're a two car family|agent:uh|user:something you're contemplating i take it	ah	1
agent:wouldn't wind up putting their knees in their throat when they sat in the backseat|agent:probably have to have something that uh|user:right	uh-huh	1
agent:sure|user:you know i'm not looking for one with a great big engine uh|user:uh	something that'll carry it around safely i guess is best best way to describe it	1
user:uh not really um|user:traction|agent:is uh traction much of an issue for you up there terms of	you know it's a two wheel drive truck and i figure if it's so bad that i need a four wheel drive i probably ought to be home anyway	0
user:um-hum|agent:flip them_1 around so we've been able to do some real creative uh load hauling when called upon|agent:got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and	one of my sons has a a Plymouth uh	0
agent:high school anyway|agent:probably till the kids are out of uh|agent:owning a mini van for some years to come	uh what about uh all wheel drive is that something that you'd be interested in or is that a not an issue	1
user:yeah i i|agent:you know ones that really add up after a while i guess you know from -[in]su[rance]- far as insurance money and stuff like that insurance costs you know everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually|agent:the ones that really	i wonder if um	0
user:what kind what kind have you been uh|user:um|user:well actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor but	have you been	1
user:you know such as things such as rape or or uh murder|user:what d[o]- what do you think is uh is an appropriate um punishment for some of the various|user:yes	or something like that	1
agent:right|user:perfect you know you you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect|user:you do the best you can to make it	but	0
agent:you know they're thinking about it they know they're going to get the chair if they get caught|agent:i g[uess]- y[ou]- y[ou]- you might be able to uh stop people|agent:stop all that stuff dead but	yeah generally the crimes of passion and things like that	0
agent:yeah they could p[robably]- probably do it again|user:because they actually could harbor these thoughts for a long time|agent:yeah	yes they they would have no problems doing it again	1
user:i don't think it deters anybody because [noise]|user:uh it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime but i don't think that it really actually does that|user:uh the problem i have with capital punishment is that uh	most of the time	1
agent:well for some things i think for serial murderer it is warranted|agent:or|user:so you're in you're in favor of capital punishment then	right	1
user:i don't know that it's always effective [laughter] but i guess we uh we're kind of stuck with it it's|user:i tend to agree with you that uh we should have it [noise] i just|user:and i'm kind of i[n]- in favor of capital punishment also i just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because uh you still see them committing the same crimes but	it's a difficult uh problem isn't it to	1
agent:i don't know because|agent:i think|user:um-hum	i know they put uh put them in jail sometimes i guess uh	1
user:to uh if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to uh execute that person|user:so if somebody killed somebody in your family [noise] then you had the right|user:if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment	and i know that uh if somebody had done something to my family	0
user:uh-huh right because they are a danger to everybody else|agent:i think they should be eliminated from society|agent:then	huh	0
user:really|agent:i almost never watch TV news [laughter] i get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio|agent:[noise]	wow	1
user:yeah|agent:[noise] and occasionally in the morning i'll pick up something like uh CNN or that but i hate watching the like ten o'clock news or|user:uh	so you have a paper or something or	1
user:so|user:well that must be pretty bad [noise]|user:[laughter]	how did that happen anyway	1
user:in fact i think there still is the uh the Daily News which runs out of the|agent:[noise]|user:yeah pretty much um there used to be	San Fernando Valley	0
user:uh news rack right around the corner from where i live which means that they're they're expanding i guess|user:there's a daily new|user:although i s[ee]- you know i'm starting to see some of their um there's	but uh a[nd]- and occasionally i- i pick up like Time magazine or something i think uh if they've got an interesting lead story but	0
user:i uh|user:yeah i know|agent:but it's still not an awful lot of news	it was it was a big discovery when when the Times when the Times found out there was a place called Orange County [laughter]	1
user:i think that uh|agent:um-hum|user:not the uh a[ppropriate]- necessarily appropriate things	uh we should be emphasizing uh things like more like education	0
user:their environment i mean uh uh p[rojects]- projects were the most idiotic concept in the world|agent:um-hum|user:help these people to fix their houses to improve their	you h[ad]- they had no sense of ownership no sense of responsibility	1
agent:government aid|agent:and uh he owned a lot of low income housing for which he got considerable|user:um-hum	right	1
agent:um-hum [noise]|user:we don't have enough balls to actually make these programs work uh we[ll]- part part of the symp[tom]- symptom of a democratic s[ystem]- system is that it it kind of uh freezes itself up|user:that uh uh	you very seldom a[ble]- a[ble]- a[ble]- able	0
agent:uh communication center|agent:well right now i'm just working um temporary just for a week or so at a|user:well what kind of job do you have	uh-huh	1
agent:um-hum|user:yeah i have i wear a uniform|agent:they have really strict clothing rules don't they	a nursing uniform	1
agent:yeah|user:will last me a long time until i have to start working more days|user:my one [laughter-uniform]	and	0
agent:i mean sometimes i think it's cheaper to stay home than because_1 at home i just wear like joggers or Levi's or you know whatever comfortable [laughter-and]|user:oh okay|agent:uh-huh	yeah definitely	1
user:whatever it|agent:oh wow|agent:[laughter]	one of those titles	1
agent:because_1 i've seen a lot of people that always look really hot but i'd n[ever]- i could never make it through a day [laughter-wearing] [laughter-what] [laughter-they're] [laughter-wearing] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] i was like|user:yeah she's really good at doing that [laughter]|agent:oh wow	exactly [laughter]	1
agent:it looks so much more natural|agent:i think that looks nice|user:see that doesn't have to be uncomfortable	yeah but you're right i think those things tend to be more expensive	1
user:[noise]|user:um-hum|agent:pressured into wearing styles just because everyone else is but	i know	1
agent:um-hum|user:or it's not happening in your backyard so it's it's more of a|user:in the US you're so far removed uh in a lot of cases from say conflicts or	it's not as a personal uh the news isn't as personal	0
agent:[noise]|user:to um|user:they don't really have the time and a lot of them_1 don't have the education and the background	oh	0
agent:and opinions spoon fed to them|agent:the not just the facts but also the conclusions|agent:that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having	yeah i- i think people are people have that opinion they they wanna sit down in front of the TV and um or	0
user:good teachers good curriculum|user:i'm happy with their school it's great|agent:um-hum	um they	0
user:but|user:um|agent:um-hum	you know i'm happy with what they're in so	1
agent:of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away [laughter] to get better schools so you know it it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of|agent:to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of|agent:it so i you know i think that one of the things one of the ways to to	yeah	1
user:and|agent:why is that|agent:yeah	huh	1
agent:i ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and|user:uh-huh|agent:the public school system very well you know with very good education	um-hum	1
user:yeah|agent:but uh [laughter] they uh most of the time [vocalized-noise] pretty careful shopping anyway i get pretty good stuff i think that uh aside from the fact all markets being internationalized and if you want to buy [laughter-American] it takes real extra work to find and it's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the US [laughter]|user:[laughter] right [laughter]	right like	1
user:essentially i h[aven't]- i don't see much of a trend i mean|user:and uh|agent:uh-huh	just like	0
user:um|agent:yeah|agent:[laughter]	i don't know	1
user:uh-huh|user:right|agent:about the Mac they're getting like if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them_1 had to go back they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with the floppy drive	yeah you sound like you must uh work in the computer business	1
agent:[noise]	[noise] so it's kind of an obsolete [laughter-question] at this point since there isn't a Soviet Union anymore but	1
agent:i- i think there's still a lot of threats there i'm not sure if you can once again like you said it's kind of obsolete is it the Soviet Union that's threatening us though|agent:sure so i mean yeah so i|user:to Libya or somewhere like that	right i- i think actually you know the the except for the fact that we happen to be due west of them and we got a fallout cloud i don't think	0
agent:since since there are is some you know disagreements between the different Commonwealths|user:um|agent:would be that say they were using nuclear weapons on themselves you know in another area	yeah	1
user:and technological aid|user:the only thing i think what we have got going for us is we have a very large stick in the form of economic aid|agent:sure	and a lot of the Republic seem to be more interested in getting the aid in than having the nuclear weapons	1
user:i mean all of them are looking to us from help not for uh|user:yeah|agent:well especially_1 now that they're divided they're not bigger than we are anymore	not looking to us for you know	0
agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	the last	0
agent:[noise]|user:as far as maintenance tasks that i do myself|user:um	i	0
user:just to pack the bearings but what i found is that they had a brake job and they ch[anged]- i had them_1|agent:just to pack the bearings|user:uh up front or something like that or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it	another thing i- i let them_1 do sometimes is that	0
user:a good back yard mechanic and i you know i took auto shop in high school it's been a while back but i- i still have a pretty good feel for it|user:i've had considerable experience i you might say i'm a me[chanic]-|user:i've	but	1
user:if you go in like just about any|user:exactly so i you know but i- i just did it anyway i like to st[ay]- i like to stay up on it you know like to st[ay]- kind of stay up on it then|user:ex[actly]-	point any you know	0
agent:that i've uh beefed up a little bit|user:um-hum|agent:and in fact i have an eighty seven mustang with a 302 in it	okay	1
agent:so i was on my way to work one day and uh the water pump pulley split laterally in half|user:hm|agent:but not far enough to notice	[laughter]	1
user:you know kind of have a little bit of freedom over that to schedule your work from day to day from week to week so every once in a while you can slip in a three day weekend without having to use a day vacation or|user:but the ability to|agent:oh okay	or just something like that	0
user:um well an example would be in the military they give a whole lot of allowances for family people they even get paid more|agent:how so|user:um [noise] like the family in some in somebody's in the way that somebody relates to the work place	they get um allowances for	0
user:if they're just gonna|agent:right|user:not foolishly giving an extra ten hours a week to some place	pork you in the end	1
agent:[noise] oh wow|user:Georgia Tech in Atlanta|agent:what school is this	[noise] but man it is just uh really expensive two years ago it was two hundred dollars for the basic uh major medical and the next year it was four hundred you know it doubled in a year like that	0
agent:uh-huh|user:uh twice a year|user:physical uh physical training test	so we were constantly expected to exercise and be in shape and then we had specific	0
agent:oh wow|user:and so i i trained quite regularly and i i raced quite often i tried to do like a ten kilometer foot race uh once a month or so|agent:uh-huh	now that i am out i pretty much kept with it until i	1
user:yeah|agent:yeah so that that's that's quite strenuous for that long of a period|agent:so	oh yeah	0
user:the nice thing i liked about foot racing was that uh for me it was pretty much non competitive|user:uh-huh|agent:don't seem to have any uh injuries like that	uh i didn't have to worry	0
user:not so much that but i have noticed a difference because i am not exercising as much anymore|user:uh|agent:have you noticed any changes since you've started reducing the fat content of your diet	in the uh in my heart rate	1
agent:yeah that's encouraging|user:which is good|user:but uh we have well at least she has noticed a significant change in h[er]- in her cholesterol and uh and triglycerides which is	yeah	0
agent:right|user:it seems fairly reliable|user:uh and uh and there's sort of an ordinary car	how about_1 you	1
user:but uh when it comes to sort of um|user:[noise] and they're kind of neat cars although they have their draw backs i mean they're they're you know they're kind of big and whatever|user:but you know i'm i'm pretty happy with what i have now as i said [noise] the other the other kind of thing a friend of mine just got a new car got a Ford Explorer	you know moving stuff around which i find myself doing fair amounts since i tend to sort of move [laughter-about] twice a year	0
agent:oh you didn't|user:no i didn't that's a Ford yeah i didn't i mean i- i would say they probably are a little bit more reliable but at least on the used car market i think that's uh|agent:you went with the import on based on that	that's [laughter-factored] into the price already and i don't i'm not i don't think it's worth the added price you pay	0
user:i|user:yeah i mean any any car wears out eventually and starts to have problems so i-|user:yeah i mean any	knew that you know i definitely	0
user:okay|user:hm|agent:no i did my clutch and they said you want us to replace the timing belt while we're in there and i said nah [laughter] now i wish and i wished i had later because i had to go in and uh i couldn't i couldn't move the car i had to go and replace it	yeah i think yeah i kin[d]- i think i remember it hearing that either the Hondas or the Toyotas um	0
EMPTY	[noise]	0
user:finances|user:my wife handles a lot of the day to day|user:yeah i usually uh	and of course we're the like ever[ybody]- like a lot of people we just scramble through month to month you know	0
user:and uh|agent:yeah so that's sort of related to her field a little bit|user:but but she enjoys it she likes keeping track of all that stuff	yeah sort of	0
user:you don't spend it [laughter]|agent:yeah if if you have something to take it out that's exactly what we've always done and we've had uh they've always had|user:because_1 if you don't see it you don't miss [laughter-it] [laughter-and] uh	yeah	1
agent:well Jim has Jim has a budget i mean he works it out every month and writes it all down|agent:yeah we|user:deductions you know [noise] coming on	uh-huh	1

agent:oh well good|user:i work at uh for a university uh Georgia Tech uh research|agent:oh okay	as a	1
agent:right|agent:[noise]|user:it's not it's not fair to just kind of do everything all the same with all guns because they're not all the same you know	like hand guns and g[uns]- uh assault rifles i think are a little bit different than rifles and shotguns	1
agent:in an hour if i had to you know|agent:get a gun|agent:fairly easily i would think i mean i- i feel like i could	um-hum	1
agent:very little punishment then there's no reason not to|agent:you know you should be punished and and [laughter] and if you know you are not going to get punished or|agent:as you commit a crime	um-hum	0
agent:uh no i sure haven't|user:have you ever been tested for drugs|agent:okay	yeah	1
agent:hm well no i've never been tested for uh drugs or anything like that|agent:oh okay uh|user:i would imagine it probably is	um-hum how do you feel about uh testing in in the uh	1
agent:um-hum|user:it was for an accounts position|user:uh Plymouth New Hampshire	and uh i actually had to take a drug test prior to getting that job	1
user:no i|agent:about every individual have experienced some drugs of some type do you thi[nk]-|agent:do you think that it's possible that uh	don't think so at all we we're uh	1
agent:oh okay|user:i think in the past there has been|agent:is it a pretty lar[ge]- so it must be a pretty large percentage still that experiment with drugs right	i think definitely in the seventies and early eighties	1
user:and more in the cities uh|user:um|user:i think you see less of it	it's more likely you're more likely to encounter that	1
user:the illegal drug makers are experimenting with more dangerous variations|user:pe[ople]- the drug makers|user:they're	of what use to be very harmless drugs	1
user:it's pretty uh pretty high|agent:well that's true|user:um	whereas three hundred years ago [laughter] the worse you could do was probably fall off a horse	1
agent:ooh|user:and i|agent:[vocalized-noise]	and i do the work on most of the work on that myself	0
agent:that's a real nice car i think|agent:hm|user:one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety one Ford Taurus because_1 they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags	yeah	1
agent:um-hum|user:well the the Saturns you can get air bags in them_1 i don't think you can get dual side air bags but one of the things the two things that|agent:or of course we've already talked you know the Taurus is safe but wha[t]- what kind of things are you looking for	i'm really	1
agent:[noise]|user:[noise] hi um	the most experience i know about that is just when we had my grandma and	0
agent:[noise] she has|agent:but uh|agent:and she has a daughter [noise] my aunt uh who lives in another state	and then there's just the grandkids	1

agent:well here they and uh live in an apartment complex and they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters so a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because|user:too inclined to do something as aggressive as that|user:i live in a a metropolitan area and uh they're not uh	uh-huh	1

agent:some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate|agent:instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get|agent:right i think here that if they uh	yeah that's a good idea	1
agent:trash|agent:annual [laughter]|agent:and phone books are a large volume of	yeah they they just matter of fact that that reminded me of an article i saw in the pa[per]- the local schools	0
agent:uh pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them|user:yeah|agent:well part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper they contain the glue and stuff and they used to have to take out all the	yeah	1

user:but i|user:um|agent:um-hum	i tend to think that	1
user:because if you look at economics across this country and|user:have the higher standard of living|user:than the people that	statistics on who	1

user:they ta[ke]- the the the the the average person in the media is far more liberal than the average person in the rest of the country and so|user:uh|agent:um-hum	uh views that are more conservative just don't get adequately represented in the mainstream media that's been documented by a number of studies but on capital punishment look that's an exception	0
user:[noise] yeah well i'm i mean i- i- i agree i think that that the problem with capital punishment is that it's irrevocable|user:um-hum|user:um-hum	if you find out you put somebody in jail wrongly you can just let them_1 out if you find out that you you killed somebody wrongly there's nothing you can do to bring them back to life so	0
user:uh discussion topic in terms of|user:actually to tell you the truth i think uh jury selection is a uh prime|user:[noise]	possible improvements on uh	1

agent:i'm sorry the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|agent:generally at least in my own experience when i purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania it's because|agent:well i mean it seems to me that	yes	1
user:with some with something like that|user:revenue they can get|user:tax schemes um in into place in the next few years it is it is a lost revenue stream right now and states c[an]- can use all the	w[ill]- do your arguments still apply	1

user:i- i feel the same thing pets are uh they|agent:and that type of thing what is your opinion|agent:for uh companionship	add a new dimension they they give you something to think about when you're kind of tired or blue or something like that and uh	1
user:somebody is depending on you you've got to do something for them or or they uh|user:they also give you a sense of of|user:and i think that that uh	they suffer	1
agent:[noise]	[noise] your turn	1
user:if you put a value on each person what you want to do is to maximize|user:uh one of the things i was thinking about is uh you know from society's point of view|agent:and so i really wouldn't know but but i feel like if i did i probably would feel that way	the end game value	0
agent:okay|user:uh in order to justify taking his life|agent:besides him	another way you could do it is weight this value by uh the value to society of the people	1
user:uh but if he only uh integrated you know integrated income over the ex[pected]- expected remainder of his life is um|user:who knows eight hundred thousand dollars|user:[noise]	small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him	1
user:uh son was murdered|user:uh i know i have a friend whose|agent:um-hum	o[n]- on the night before his sixteenth birthday	1

agent:uh [vocalized-noise] i prefer to travel [laughter-rather] than buy things so|agent:i'm not buying much in terms of consumer products these days|user:how about you	yeah i- i hear you there the	0
user:because like especially if you watch TV|user:right you know i- i find there's that you just have to be really careful|agent:the real thing	there's like all such of scams going on	0
user:you know once [vocalized-noise] your name on|agent:uh-huh|user:getting married this summer and we're going to like wedding expos and things to get fashion and half the thing's like yes we'll give you a free makeover [vocalized-noise] we're Mary Kay cosmetics and	you our mailing list you know you're damned for life because	0

user:[noise]|agent:and the vendor that he bought it from [vocalized-noise] gave it back to him yesterday charged him forty five dollars and told him that it was a software problem|user:[vocalized-noise]	[vocalized-noise]	1
user:there's some really it's not um|user:right i- i mean the best example [vocalized-noise] i g[uess]- i guess|agent:and he already knew that it wasn't a software problem	uh the the chain the some really luxurious uh de[partment]- uh department store in in Texas	1
agent:uh-huh|user:a building house|user:and i went with a friend of mine and we undertook	and this was um	0
agent:[laughter]|agent:um-hum|user:one of our main problems was as well in Massachusetts i thought i was going to well it was a fun time but i thought gosh summer time you know well all it ever did was rain and [laughter-thunderstorms] and	[noise] one thing is that we're	0
user:a very good finish|user:um|agent:um-hum	but it turned it was okay and it's only the basement floor so it was okay	1
user:this|user:for my friend's parents they had some property there and they'd lived in this|user:well it was um	old it's sort of like a farm you might say and they live in this old house	1
agent:right|user:you know the solar game|user:temperature changes in um	have you what what are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or	1
agent:yep|agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum	-[a]fraid i haven't uh	0
user:we have one credit card um|agent:[laughter]|user:yeah my husband is a finance major also [laughter] and uh we kind of have the same plan um	every month we put um you know the same amount in for retirement um and we budget we're our our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby	0
agent:that money is put into each month|user:i see|agent:each of our ch[ildren]- we have three children so they each have their own account	uh-huh does your husband deal in um stocks and bonds and	0
agent:i do uh-huh all the money|user:well you know um what do you do as far as i- i take it do you um run the family budget as far as uh groceries and that sort of thing|agent:yeah [laughter]	uh-huh and how	0
agent:yes we have a household budget like we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year and also we need a new bed|user:um a big item like for the house how do you have like a household|agent:and we're	um-hum	1
user:yes that's that was true for mine too|agent:yeah|user:yeah it was a a it's a more or less a suburban school system	um	0
user:but uh certainly before that there are people that you know like would graduate from high school and could barely read|user:but uh|agent:right	um	0
agent:[noise]|user:i mean i think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably i mean i don't i think|user:yeah	you know if people just	1
agent:did send their kids to private schools i think they compare fair[ly]- you know fairly well|agent:the people that uh|agent:if you compare the like the people that could have that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that you know	yeah	1
user:of uh|user:y[ou]- well no i guess it wa[s]- in junior high it was still three then in high school it changed into four levels|user:all the way through high school there were four levels	of instruction in the major subjects	1
user:they'll rank themselves much higher than will for example Korean students who do much better at math|user:these are these are scores on standardized tests and yet if you uh give American students the question i am good at math|user:um i don't know seventeenth out of twenty three industrialized nations we're really low i mean i'd be really even surprised if they were that high	and um [noise] a number of educational theorists uh pre[dominately]- predominately conservative or they're called conservative because they think this i suppose	0
user:um-hum|agent:are those are are as you talk about that it reminds me of of one problem that i think is probably as far as my perception is the most glaring error that is because i know a lot of school teachers i know a lot of par[ticularly]- particularly girls who in like in their|user:to get no progress or very little progress	um-hum	1
agent:but i'm sure i'm sure that it it's like uh i work at AT&T and now i- i if i want to spend four hundred dollars|user:um-hum|agent:i don't know i don't know if we're getting a quality education from [vocalized-noise] teachers who are underpaid	um-hum	1
agent:but no no money for supplies|user:um-hum|agent:yeah i think so i oh for example they will have a a million dollar building	yeah	1
user:up along|user:yeah definitely here in Utah|user:yeah	the Wasatch front along the	1
agent:uh it's supposed to have about the worst air [laughter-pollution]|agent:yeah i live in the university district and uh|agent:yeah	[noise]	1
agent:oh really they make you do that remotely|user:and|user:basically how much of what is coming out the exhaust kind of like a radar gun	yes	0
user:of certain pollutants and it was like unburned hydrocarbons|user:um|agent:jeez	then a a properly tuned car and and the idea being that if you just tuned up	0
user:the uh|user:[noise] do you think should be done for the|agent:[noise]	huge budget we have	1
agent:would be as possible for them with out us i mean i don't think Europe is consumer oriented as we are|agent:if we're dependent on them they're most certainly dependent upon us i don't think that the world market would|agent:once Japan becomes	huh	1
user:well actually their [vocalized-noise] well that's one thing but we also|agent:over the last twenty years we've strictly gone down hill and the salary's gone up|agent:unregulated and and	got to change the voting stuff and the uh special interest groups and all that stuff	0
user:oh still i mean we have the right to do it we don't do it that's the whole problem we don't exercise those rights|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:no i- i don't even think uh participation would have [vocalized-noise] as far as democrats and republicans go it'd have to be a third party	i don't know i think part of the things is maybe a value added tax like what they have in Europe i mean	0
agent:that i can't even comprehend|agent:you know we're we're talking about numbers|user:uh you know the people that do it it's a very difficult task i'm not saying that any of this is easy [laughter]	yeah	1
user:i babysat for a dentist while she worked|user:in high school and then just recently after we were married|user:[noise] i was a babysitter	and i just	1
user:then she could be at home and then i'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if i wanted too or whatever but|user:and um|user:so she could sleep in	um	0
agent:i don't know|agent:but [noise]|user:yeah	i think people that treat their baby sitters like that get a lot better baby sitters	1
agent:and just have like t[en]- at the most like ten kids and all from maybe people that you know type of thing instead of trying actually to set up a day care where you don't know the people coming in and|user:uh-huh|agent:i think yeah i think the best way to go would just be to to be able to do it out of your basement	no	1
agent:you know you never know what they're going to get into|user:that's impossible|user:oh yeah	i have a girlfriend that works at a day care and she takes her little girl with her and	0
agent:i just i couldn't do it i don't think|user:yeah|agent:unless it was a friend that you know did it in their house that i knew well	it would just rip me apart i think [noise] i don't know	1
user:[laughter]|agent:uh usually the the the album sounds better than the concert and i don't like fighting the crowds [laughter]|user:uh do you go to any concerts	well you have a point there uh	0
agent:get home and let's uh pick pick out a something on the symphony something that will really relax me|user:[noise]|agent:yeah that that that is something i i'd rather it's one of those things where i have a very stressful day at work and then i'll	yeah	1
agent:they have people that re[done]- have redone the song|agent:i guess it's elevator music where they|agent:but what i don't like is listening to a a station that will play uh	oh yeah	1
agent:um-hum|user:we're we're blessed in Dallas with a new symphony center just a few years old|agent:it was like why bother	it was designed by I M Pei and it's absolutely fabulous	0
agent:i can't i can't uh sing worth a darn|user:[laughter]|agent:well with my voice i'm glad that they drown me out [laughter]	yeah	0

user:um|user:cars are i'd look under the hood and i see all the|user:feelings about	all the stuff under there and i say boy my chances of of doing	1
agent:is it an Accord|user:ah [vocalized-noise]|user:so yeah and it's a it's a absolutely flawless car it uh and it's the smoothest car i've ever ridden i uh [noise]	what's that	1
user:i- i think one of the things that they are going to have to|user:with uh the Japanese but as far as|user:because they think they can catch up uh	impress me with is is again this uh	0
agent:i mean and i don't even get the sixty i only make i only get the thirty so [laughter] [laughter]|user:[vocalized-noise] well i said sixty dollars an hour|agent:wow that's as much as i make programming [laughter]	they charged me a hundred and thirty dollars labor but they clocked my car out at	0
agent:yeah|user:yeah so uh anyway what i'm looking for is is reliability because i wanna keep it away from the from the uh the repair people|user:that uh	and the other thing i'm i guess i'd be looking for is uh	1
user:i think um|agent:uh-huh|user:personally i think it's good	there's a lot of things that	0
agent:oh really what denomination|user:how shall i say it uh service in the Far East for my church|user:um	yeah	0
user:about uh|user:you know went on uh contributing and and like i say in every case uh they benefited and i'm they have lifelong happy memories about|user:come back from that and joined the Peace Corps and	the things that they did now does that mean that everybody is going to have happy memories well [noise] i don't know but in Europe an[d]- in many states in Europe they do the same thing they they want everybody to	0
user:how shall i say it that's part of the experience i think because not every|user:yeah well well that's part of the|agent:have been really lonely	[noise] oh how shall i say it not every uh	1

agent:apparently it's like a retirement community and they knew a lot of friends who had done the same thing|agent:but my other grandparents had|agent:[noise] well we didn't catch it for my first grandmother my first set of grandparents	yeah	1
user:[laughter] on a scale i guess i'm about a nine and a half|agent:so how does that rate you in the uh the scale that they've given us|user:[laughter] but [laughter-uh]	so i've let's see s[o]-	1
agent:right|user:you're a member and so then the question comes up uh well if you really believed in it why wouldn't you be a member|agent:right this is a rather a int[eresting]-	but anyway	0
user:it can be kind of scary the idea of just everybody wandering around with uh|user:well it's i know it can be uh|agent:so	uh	1
user:some some of my friends were saying you know that's another argument for gun control i said oh yeah he should have lived in in uh|user:one of the|user:uh	he should of have lived in in uh	0
user:with uh this topic is that|user:how do i say this the uh the thing that i have noticed|user:the uh	that	0
user:Virginia should have a lot of them_1|user:now my earlier statement about if if they caused crime then|user:and uh try and and pick it apart so uh let's see what was the other thing i was going to say uh	should have a lot of crime	0
user:and|user:bu[t]- but it's the uh it's the nature|agent:right exactly	and my feeling if you go back to England	0
agent:[laughter] w[hat]- okay|user:well anyway if you had a lawn|agent:uh no	uh uh if you if you've ever had a lawn	1
agent:and every year he vetos it [laughter] and upsets people|user:[laughter]|agent:the uh gov[ernment]- the state assembly gets together and tries to pass a death penalty bill	[laughter] gets sort of repetitious	1
agent:i you know in that case then i'm all for putting them_1 behind bars as long as there's no chance of parole but you know what it's like when they|user:yeah|agent:if it comes down to a money issue	yeah there's always those loopholes	1
user:and yeah it drags on for about forever you know i guess i'm about your your opinion of it i have nothing against it philosophically|user:um well i can i can vouch for the fact that the uh the appeals will go through and go through and go through|agent:i don't know what your feelings are about it being in Florida where you've had it before	in terms of if you're absolutely sure i mean uh uh	0
user:that it really doesn't [laughter-save] [laughter-you] any money if it's a money thing and as a deterrent thing i don't really think uh personally i don't feel|user:that uh|user:but i i've also heard that that these things cost so much in the end	that capital pun[ishment]- punishment as a deterrent is a is a big deal	0
agent:the like [noise]|user:yeah|agent:i- i- i agree with you i'm not really that terribly against it as long as it looks like it's going to work and reduce the court load and [noise]	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:and i think we did them a big disservice by putting them in public schools|agent:that went to a private school and then we put them into public school system|agent:okay well i have one child that's in public schools now i have three children	hm	1
user:ah|agent:no it it supplements the schools that for therefore there's no state income tax|user:oh okay i g[ot]- i got the impression you said the oil money paid for the schools so	uh-huh	1
agent:well there's no disciplinary actions you know that can be d[one]- taken against them at all|user:and you're not gonna do anything|agent:exactly	but you	1
user:well you know|agent:having to call their parents [laughter-and] [laughter-have] [laughter-their] [laughter-parents] [laughter-come] [laughter-in] [laughter-and] [laughter-all] this kind of stuff i mean it really is a major thing|user:[noise] well maybe they'll make them [vocalized-noise]	yeah well maybe they'll make them_1 stay home for a day but that's no [laughter-torture] [laughter-for] [laughter-a] [laughter-kid]	1
agent:right right i know i|user:dupe me [laughter-i] [laughter-think]|user:you know realizing that he can	but i- i think the the public school it's not that the teachers are inferior or that the materials are inferior i think what's going on is that	0
agent:i th[ink]- i think there will be more why what do you think|user:yeah|agent:become more politically actively i mean	well i-	0
agent:that smaller uh|agent:at all in my vote in the you know in that in that even|agent:uh i don't see any importance	isn't	1
user:have to say i really don't have a budget|user:well i|agent:uh how about_1 yourself	both my wife and i uh	1
user:although we just moved to California and uh the cost of living here in California is um|agent:yeah|agent:within your means	i would say rather pathological [laughter]	0
agent:[laughter]|user:uh and one way you know that is that only God can afford it [laughter]|agent:yeah	um	1
agent:um-hum|user:oh six hundred and ten dollars a month or something like that|user:[vocalized-noise] in my discipline was like	and uh i noted at that point that i was	0
agent:yeah|user:well i guess we're both lucky in that regard then|agent:to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money	uh how big is your family	1
user:and uh he has a teller card so he can uh do what he wi[shes]- do what he wishes with the money that i put in the bank but at least it isn't|agent:yeah|user:and i give give him the other half in cold cash	you know burning a hole in his pocket	1

user:as|user:it's uh it's you you it's the same it's the same premise|user:right	day care for a child	1
user:i'm sorry|user:but there's okay|agent:yeah that's it but the thing is hold on i got one more thing and i'll let you talk [laughter] because_1 we started talking about that you know we started saying well you know some family members might not agree to do that	right	1
agent:um background checks before they just hand a gun over to any old person|agent:something in that order i think that it's important that there be some check|agent:in the past of um committing crimes or uh	um-hum yeah i sort of believe the same way i think i'm	0
user:someone buys a a handgun and like i say a week or two weeks as a cooling off period|user:as just that a waiting period before|user:i'm in favor of a waiting period	but uh i- i guess the uh NRA they kind of look at it as a springboard	0
agent:[laughter]|user:yeah that that is true|agent:um just because you know what kind of legitimate hunting use can you do with an AK-47 [laughter-i] [laughter-mean]	um	0
user:it seems to me like like that that weapon|agent:yeah|user:the uh like you mentioned the plastic handguns the Glock	they could it s[eems]- it seems to me like they could bypass all the	0
agent:um that's pretty much how they've gone about it up here and some of the tactics i mean i noticed they changed their commercials|agent:versus hunting|agent:um attuned to personal protection	um-hum	1
user:h[eard]- heard the that proposed before and i'm not uh discounting it completely but|user:i've i've uh|agent:kind of follows with that it's just a question of how long before you pay the price	the counter argument to that	0
user:Catholic and other|user:uh|user:these days there's a lot of [noise] uh there a lot of	parochial schools around that are not staffed by nuns and	0
user:and uh|user:you've got an absolute monopoly|user:our schools are reflecting the same kind of mismanagement that uh lead to the demise of the Soviet Union and that is when	you can't uh you know it's a one party system so to speak then what you're going to have is gross inefficiencies and nobody cares	1
user:and uh|agent:hm|user:some of the other problems uh with De[troit]- it's not the worker it's the uh it's the management	management frankly just doesn't have to they don't have to compete these days	1
user:i i hate to see the|user:uh|user:with uh oh there there are other problems and number one it would be nice if if teachers got paid uh	how shall i say it the garbage the guys that collect garbage and and uh	0
user:and if somebody decides that they're going t[o]- if their decisions are out of step with reality|user:uh because there is a lot of competition|agent:um-hum	uh pretty soon people don't stop going there	1

agent:uh how many people have we read about or heard about in the national news that have been picked up and because of a technicality they're left let off|agent:yeah i think that's wr[ong]- i think that's where the law has got to change because they've found|user:without good reason	yeah an ac[tually]-	1
agent:oh yeah um-hum|user:just in general the whole we've only been here a couple of years uh before that we lived in Colorado but in comparison to Colorado it's real noticeable|agent:yeah [noise]	i mean you can just feel i mean i can just sense i mean i won't even i won't go to the grocery store at night	1

user:well no i i've i've explored that with lots of people uh they've tried to lock me up and uh|user:but|agent:any particular reason [noise]	things like that but um	1
agent:uh-huh|user:i do learn about things|user:what am i trying to say uh	l[argely]- largely from friends and i occasionally will read something like the New York Review Of Books you know someone will write a book about something	0
agent:but assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas|user:uh-huh|agent:reads Consumer Reports so the people who do feel that Consumer Reports does a a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest	uh-huh	1
agent:whether it's worth the amount of time it [laughter-takes] to keep up on things|agent:there's there's a reasonable question as to|agent:well i mean	yeah what	1
user:[noise] the Supreme Court hearings uh the for um|user:on the uh|user:i did	uh the whole business of uh	0
user:watching it for a couple of hours zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and ea[ting]- watching it some more and i thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on|user:engrossed in that we ended up|user:and when i arrived at her house she was	but even then	0
user:oh i suppose i uh substitute teach in our public schools|agent:area right|agent:uh have the more variety in this	and what i find out nowadays is people are wearing jeans and and very casual things Polo shirts [laughter-uh] i'm of the opinion that i'm not one of the kids and i want them to know that so i'll dress a little more formally i mean not a business suit but you know a nice skirt and blouse or	1
user:uh you know as much as i'm there to be their|agent:uh-huh|user:a[nd]- and take too many liberties and i think	uh	0
agent:actually i try to stay behind the scenes which means i wear slacks and uh|agent:no|user:so i i guess you're in a business suit all the time	oh	1
agent:whatever|agent:to uh|agent:now this this question did it relate to work or did it relate to	i think it was just um clothing and how you feel about it and do you change your wardrobe from season to season	0
agent:gee she's eight now so i guess about ten years good heavens|agent:our older child will be ready for college in about uh|agent:something we're starting [noise] to think about because	um-hum	1
agent:and the old uh if you can't see it then you can't spend it uh idea [laughter]|user:that's kind of how we do it anyway but|user:so uh that works out much better for us so	[laughter-e[xactly]-] [laughter-exactly] and if you can't touch it you can't spend it either so that kind of works out where you get into uh some plans that	0
user:oh definitely definitely and uh|agent:wish i could afford to uh put more away each week because_1 i agree that it's a an excellent way|user:uh-huh	it grows uh it it seems like at first you're not gonna see a big return but as the years go on if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better	0
user:you know long term type of planning so|user:y[ou]- you better have some other way of uh savings otherwise uh checking accounts aren't the best for|user:yeah it it's easy because_1 you do spend it that's for sure like i said you know you kind of look at it uh	and you don't get a good return on it anyway so	1
user:kind of took them_1 out of that because they got so low but uh|user:that uh had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and uh|user:you know we have some in-laws uh	yeah it's it drops so your better bet is to uh	0
agent:right now i think my favorite ones are Parenting and Car and Driver|user:well Dave what's your favorite magazine|agent:[noise]	[laughter-Parenting] and Car and Driver i see	1
user:and uh|user:yeah well i think it's the April issue i do get that one and the April issue always compares all the new cars|agent:i try to keep most of my magazines down	that's it's invaluable when if you're shopping for a new car even if you're looking for an old one because it tells you history of repairs and that sort of things on different models	1
user:yeah that uh|user:yeah|agent:older model Datsuns and Toyotas and Fords	that i[t]- that year end book that Consumer Reports put out is sometimes a little condensed too	0
user:[noise] which is another one that has nice pictures in it|user:and and rather stra[nge]- strange one i suppose i get Fine Home Building|user:i get Money and that's another one i don't have time to read	you know if i ever build the ultimate dream home [laughter-or] [laughter-something] [laughter-i'll] [laughter-know] [laughter-how] [laughter-to] [laughter-do] [laughter-it]	1
user:articles that help you repair things|user:they often have uh|user:it it helps you out with minor repairs and of course the usual Popular Science and Popular Electronics	but i have to confess i've never read Car and Driver	1
agent:yeah i stopped doing that a long time ago|user:yeah [noise] i- i don't subscribe to that|agent:for the price anymore i don't think they're worth it	yeah i	1
agent:[laughter]|agent:yeah|user:uh-huh you have to say that	um	1
agent:like everybody else even though they're they're supposed to be impartial but|agent:i mean he could have like a personal prejudice you know judges are people|agent:uh i'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole	that's right	1
agent:um|agent:yeah i something like that i've got no problem with them_1|user:killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact	yeah	1
agent:yeah probably|agent:uh|user:yeah six months so far they said	so	1
user:uh i don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out|user:anytime|user:um no i haven't but in my job i'm a nurse and we are allowed to be i mean you know this is the rules that they can do this	and been tested	1
agent:a hallucinogen|agent:it came back that she tested positive for using|agent:it didn't cause her any problems with her job but	uh-huh	1
user:but|agent:see i always i thought they got you got called back if you tested positive for more test|user:or this person never use any drugs	um	0
agent:uh-huh|user:i- i interviewed for a job recently and i was taking Entex|user:and if you could show that	and my doctor gave me a prescription for it and he said this way	0
agent:i mean|user:yeah i'm not sure either the only way i can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it|user:so i don't know	then	0
agent:yeah|user:[laughter-so] you know i guess you sort of you have to have trust some place along the way|user:i should be protected from it they don't test my patients for too	you can't go around testing everybody for everything	0
agent:i know|user:maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago|user:but	that's the other thing i mean a lot of	0
user:parents say or or or or like grandparents whatever it is uh|user:that's right that's right you know what what uh what do you think is important if you were uh i don't know how how old you are but if you had if you had uh|agent:the care of the elderly	who were ready who who who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for	1
user:um i mean the the environment there i don't know too much about it but it it seems|user:and it seems|agent:um-hum	nice enough uh it it's hard at least half of the residents i would say are not	0
user:who who are just|user:um it must be depressing for the people who who are|user:uh there i would say it's the same thing it's a it's a nice uh is relatively nice environment but again	[vocalized-noise] too old ess[entially]- essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house	0
agent:um-hum so it gives them a sense of identity|agent:um-hum|user:we used to see a husband and wife in there uh together and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were but these two were and when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house	and so y[ou]-	1
user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	what do you usually wear to wor[k]-	1
user:and that's [vocalized-noise] so generally then i dress|agent:um-hum|user:but over the summers i've had a job internships with the newspaper	you know nicer usually nice summer slacks or more sometimes skirts stuff like that	1
agent:financial people in it and it|agent:uh to one of the buildings that has a lot more of the|agent:so anyway i wore this suit and i went over to uh	um-hum	1
agent:yes i[t]- it is|user:oh well that's nice that's good for the clothes budget i would imagine|agent:we don't have that much it's uh it's a very mild climate	because_1 here	0
agent:constantly every single organization|agent:i get these calls on one line just|agent:yeah they were uh bugging me for a donation earlier and i- i you know	yeah	1
agent:program and i love it you can call up on one of the lines the|user:family right|agent:and uh they have their friends and family	yeah [vocalized-noise] they they fixed it so you had to give some information out but	1
user:and you know there there's a lot of of risk involved there because|user:you had to know your pin number but i could jus[t]- i could just say to it empty my whole account out if i wanted transfer things|agent:yeah	you know it it's like you know the best example is probably credit reports now	0
agent:oh yeah it's a pain in the neck because_1 they you know they['ll]- they'll believe these companies in a second over the individual|user:and i had to get a letter from this other company saying that i had closed it|agent:[laughter]	yeah	1
user:right|user:ri[ght]-|agent:yeah [laughter] i know i know it's just that cons[umer]- we need to have stronger consumer protection laws and we just don't seem to be able to get the government to do it	well you know there's much more subtle kinds of invasions of privac[y]- like every time you call an eight hundred number	0
user:i am from Mars i mean i'm fifty years old|user:yeah well i- i i i feel like um|user:yes	and uh i've been divorced for um eighteen years	0
user:but really i'm i'm in a happy i i well i'm curious how other people live|agent:that sounds kind of like me|agent:[laughter]	uh	0
user:huh|agent:[laughter-and] then we [laughter-started] [laughter-borrowing] [laughter-from] [laughter-one] [laughter-envelope] [laughter-to] [laughter] [laughter-put] it in the [laughter-other] envelope and [laughter] in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do|agent:and we did that pretty successfully for about three months	the um	0
user:but i i had miscalculated|user:bouncing checks just at the end of the month|user:uh i had i i kept	i well i didn't keep a balance [laughter]	0
agent:uh-huh|user:i spent on food so i could do better planning|user:so i could see at the end of a month how much	but i would forget to write the things down and i[t]- it that	0
user:i- i have to say|user:the uh i|user:uh-huh	that let's see at this point on i don't run out of money	0
user:well|user:i don't go out i mean i buy a car|user:i[s]- i[s]- is is to is to not spend money i mean i don't have expensive tastes	the last car i got rid of i'd had it was nineteen years old	0
user:i only do that every week or um without even i mean|user:i mean i don't mind buying a good steak but for me|user:i tend to eat expensive food	maybe once a month	0
agent:[noise]	[noise]	0
agent:oh okay|user:um and uh so we're we're part we're actually part of MIT so it's very much the same kind of place and|agent:yes	a technical institution	1
agent:and it may not be true in every place in a lot of cases i think you're treated more like a number instead of a a person|agent:you're treated|agent:time nowadays even though you're working uh	um-hum	1
agent:and even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that|user:hm|agent:yes i do i really do i think it'd be better that way	um-hum	1
agent:right|user:and uh have gave everybody a half day a week off|agent:right	and i think you can do that for a little while but i'm	1
user:so i would suspect that you know pneumonia i think is one of them and and the cancers and whatnot|user:so|agent:right	so i think indirectly there there is extra AIDS	0
user:well do you think that|user:yeah|user:yeah	one reason maybe that the the funding level is as high as it is is because	1
agent:on basically warehousing AIDS victims|agent:is spending or at least was when i was there spending a large portion of their bu[dget]- their budget on on|agent:and i know for example uh Parkland Hospital	uh-huh i suspect that's true	1
user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:you don't get any newspapers|user:um you know uh through conversation or whatever but uh most of the time it's through the news in the evening so	newspapers no i'm not too much in reading newspapers uh not that i don't enjoy newspapers or anything like that but	0
agent:yeah two newspapers in the morning|user:you read it in the morning then|agent:we have two newspapers	yeah	1
user:you know news is probably what i hear through the grapevine or whatever but uh|agent:just|user:that's kind of like you said then we we are kind of on the opposite where i get home and uh while i'm cooking supper the TV's on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what's going on and uh very seldom do i catch the ten o'clock so by that time	unless there's a big issue going on like when we were at war then i think everybody was glued to the TV to find out what was going on	0
user:do it|user:you know you know a lot of people that read the news to newspapers to get the news of what's going on and uh other people that you know|user:yeah that's true	differently or don't even	0
agent:weather is still warm here|user:sure|agent:where the	sure i suppose you watch for hurr[icanes]- hurricanes coming in and	0
user:yeah that's|user:[laughter] to take off sure|agent:so i can be at the at the beach when the waves start coming in	sounds pretty good so	1
user:i think you're right because i was an only child too|agent:they're the pivot point of the universe|agent:but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the	and that's one reason i have so many [laughter] because i really	0
user:but um yeah it's it's a little bit difficult though i think it was easier when they all had each other and could|agent:yeah|user:when things don't go [laughter-right] she just calls one of them [laughter-you] [laughter-know]	entertain each other and i was home more	0
agent:no you c[an't]- and there's not enough time um|user:well you can't afford to|agent:then you don't	right	1
agent:um-hum [noise]|user:when i did this now i do work full time|user:um	and it's just my thirteen year old and myself and so we really have to	0
user:right|agent:wha[t]- and they you know the housing so cheap in comparison to Boston that they jump on it they sell their house they stash away a good bit of money|user:really	that's what i've heard	1
user:uh i think|agent:um-hum|user:because_1 my thought leads to you know i have uh school age kids	a a a good amount of money ought to go to the education which they they d[oing]- seem to be doing	1
agent:right|user:and they s[aid]- they needed a lab assistant and i'm working part-time now i'm a substitute teacher|agent:um-hum	uh but you know i get called sporadically and they needed this lab assistance in the neighborhood and said you didn't have to have experience i'm really an artist but i figured oh you know i'll find out what it is	0
agent:so|user:hm|agent:and they don't they don't have many RNs and very few BSNs	the care is shoddy	1
user:uh|agent:yes we do yes we do|user:it's a mystery	so i guess you're saying you think we should spend more for AIDS research	0
agent:you know i[t]- it also concerns me because i have a convertible and uh you know there's certain areas around here where i'd be afraid to drive with my top down|agent:uh|user:right	yeah well i have the same thing [laughter] and i understand because_1 i live very close to Dallas	1
user:and put them to work doing something useful|user:really can't do any harm and not let them out on parole in six months or three years or whatever|user:and put the real criminals in jail where they	where they don't just eat up our tax dollars	1
agent:but putting it that way that is kind of ironic that she'd be using up tax dollars but|user:other than put this lady in jail to set an example|user:i just have a real problem with that i think there's another way to deal with that	that's right	0
agent:you know uh|user:yeah|agent:you know jail as a concept at least is not working in some cases	yeah and also i think that they can get off on too many technicalities	1
agent:sure|user:for what i thought you know would be fair you just figure oh well the judge will be fair well forget it [laughter] you know it's no[t]- it doesn't happen they're in a hurry their docket is full they want you in they want you out|user:i've been through a two year divorce recently and i find that the system sucks to put it bluntly and so you know [laughter] i just i don't have a lot of respect anymore	and that's the way it is and so	1
user:that Bill Clinton might be|user:i- i don't see him as that kind of a guy i can believe like|user:you know i think you know i[f]- if you know taking the current batch we've got you like i think Paul Tsongas probably isn't in it for like his own gain	um i certainly think a lot of people in Congress are	1
user:you know you hear these guy i think that this is the first election i've heard about where a lot of the incumbents are really f[inding]- saying okay we're getting out because it's too much heat|user:but it it's really true i mean if|agent:yeah	i mean normally it's yeah okay what big scandal but it comes times to reelect them they say hey this is the guy that brings home the bacon for us you know he's got seniority on all these committees we're not gonna replace him	1
user:i- i mean the problem is that|agent:uh act as an honest person|agent:can i uh	you know you've got	0
agent:and there's a lot of corruption|agent:you scratch my back i'll scratch yours uh i would even i would disagree with you a little bit because i think that in the state level that's just part of the uh the internship so to speak|agent:uh	i- i think it depends a lot on	0
user:[laughter]|agent:uh they'd have that job for life and you really didn't have to worry too much about that but ever since this Reagan Bush thing|agent:i can remember where we really you know somebody would work for a local company here like Kodak or Xerox which are based here and	i know	1
agent:Buffalo and Pittsburgh and cities around here that were into mechanical and engineering and things like that steel mills they're all gone they're all in Mexico now [laughter]|user:right [laughter]|agent:Rochester's luckily is a technology moving city i mean we have a lot of telecommunications and the like out here but	[laughter]	0
agent:well i heard Apple was remaking themselves into a consumer electronics company|user:and that's really bad|user:you know we we notice our product just becoming a commodity	we're trying	0
user:repair actually uh that is really a sore spot with me i i think|agent:[laughter]|user:try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of	perhaps the automotive industry is improving but uh like ten years ago	1
agent:um-hum|user:uh subsequently i got a uh Buick Century and it wasn't as bad|user:it was i[t]- it was a real lemon	but uh last year i bought a Honda Accord and i take it in once every seventy five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance and that is it and it's wonderful an[d]-	1
agent:and i was telling him that i just had a new master cylinder put on and he s[aid]- looked at and he said that's not a new master cylinder|agent:not a man not a repair man but just a friend|agent:and he asked me you know	hm	1
agent:yeah i just pay for the parts and he does it so|user:right|agent:take me	well that's wonderful	0
agent:oh okay|user:um and i use their tools an[d]- i- an[d]- an[d]- and some of their guidance i'm an artist|agent:oh	and i'm very handy and you know if i touch it i it turns [laughter-into] [laughter-something] [laughter-u[sually]-]	0
agent:yeah|user:so i'm a licensed teacher but jobs being what they are i substitute teach|agent:oh okay [noise]	and that way i have time for my kids too and	0
agent:yes we have one|user:i went there we have Home Depot out here i don't know if you've heard of it i went and i got|agent:uh that's neat	two six foot inch thick boards turned into watermelon i had to cut it into	0
agent:right|user:by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think [laughter-about]|user:on the radial saw	so	1
user:pocket it a little bit quick|user:small corporations they seem to|user:when it comes to uh	quickly or whatever or however you wanna say it	1
agent:well i've worked for uh well i worked for H and R Block here in Massachusetts for awhile|agent:right|user:the pros and cons of both	sure	0
user:um-hum|agent:right and we have the eye glasses the health care and the whole kit and caboodle because what they did is they threw the all the town employees in together|user:that's pretty good for you know being a a school district type program	wow	1
user:health care uh you had your insurance and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a a very small place|user:um you know things like that so i've been looking at big corporations and saying the big corporation that i've worked for in the past had the pension plans had the big health|agent:oh	um	0
user:uh-huh|user:yeah|agent:and he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired an[d]- but i hear that bill is in the Senate right now and it's	sure	0
user:yeah|agent:which was really great because_1 we don't have to pay a mayor [laughter]|agent:um where it's extremely large they were able to offer a little bit more	uh-huh yeah	0
user:i wouldn't even dream of in this small corporation you bring it up to the owner and it's like|user:that have vacation times and bene[fits]- benefits that|agent:right [laughter]	come on you know partly it's because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer	1
user:take her back because she was|user:they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble and the nursing home made them come and|user:and uh	being a a	0
user:place that was also associated with it so for|user:there was some sort of full-time care|user:[noise] my grandmother actually was in a a nursing home that um there was a retirement hotel and then a uh	um the first few years she had her own apartment and you know made her own meals sometimes but could	0
user:that move into nursing homes die very quickly and that's|user:but my experience has been that most people|user:um she didn't have to do anything anymore	some i don't know whether that's because they you know sort of give up hope once they get in there or	1
agent:the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them|agent:that's my grandparents it was just so that|agent:right right	uh-huh	1
user:well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to|user:yeah|agent:where sometimes the quality of living has gone down and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore	have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing	1
agent:well i can profit by this because i'm due with my first in about three months|user:i guess i would say it's not easy to find what what most parents would want|user:i guess uh some child care each one of them an[d]- now they're in school so it's all over but uh	is that right	0

agent:yeah you don't really think about it until you you're in a situation where you have to think about it|agent:right|user:uh i'm paying attention to things that i never paid bef[ore]- uh att[ention]- a[ttention]- attention to	on the other hand like i say they	0
user:that|user:the way it worked in practice was|user:but	uh in order to get enough	1
user:i'm saying well|user:i'm|user:so on the one hand i	now i know how people that don't have insurance feel and on the other hand i'm saying uh	1

user:uh-huh|agent:which saves on the cost|user:oh	we have a lot of those at the building where i work and i think they're made out of teak	1
agent:and they're happy to talk to you|agent:they have you can call them th[e]- their restoration lab|agent:and	oh is that right	1
user:uh|agent:right that's when you see everybody is when somebody dies it's awful [laughter]|user:[laughter-or] [laughter-somebody's] [laughter-funeral] unfortunately	yeah it just never occurred to us to have a a family [rev[iew]-/reunion] reunion i	0
agent:and it it more or less turned out we brought food for our own family the people like my father my mother and myself my husband and my kids|user:yeah yeah i was gonna say you're not Italian are you [laughter]|user:whoa [laughter]	uh-huh	1
user:it's funny [laughter]|agent:[laughter] but uh we're trying to get my mother's go[ing]- you know trying to get my mother's family going because my grandmother just died|user:and there's sort of an Italian sound i don't know it's hard to describe but it's [laughter-there]	oh	1
user:um-hum|agent:that way i know how much pocket change i'm going to have left [laughter-at] [laughter-the] [laughter-end] of the month or at the end of the paycheck anyway|user:um-hum um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:um-hum|user:and usually that's enough|user:and then we put our receipts in there you know	and um	1
agent:that last week's pretty lean generally [laughter-speaking] so|agent:and|user:yeah so	yeah so you know i really have to try to budget	1
user:uh-huh|user:yeah|agent:it's yeah it's really bad but um it's going pretty well and i've got a real good plan mapped out here so	i also like belong to a Christmas club be[cause]- you know i used to belong to a Christmas club last year i didn't	0

agent:well that's a good way to to make a little extra money|user:so which i've been doing|agent:um-hum um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me i don't know|agent:i mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have a eyewitness|agent:sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent	so you think if if trials were held by judges or experts that they they would tend not to	0
agent:right|user:well they're like lawyers i guess they're experts in the law and uh|user:uh three or four judges who are	there [noise] there really isn't a jury and uh	1
user:couple of judges or|user:actually i think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a|user:uh well	a jury [noise] what i what i worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual that's where you really need a jury of peers	1
user:i guess i don't think that uh|user:well|user:um	um	0
agent:right|user:make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent that's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe|user:a courtroom i trust them to	but people who do[n't]- who don't have day in and day out life long experience with	0
user:um|user:it's kind of a|agent:um-hum	hanging jury atmosphere	0
agent:yeah|user:insurance cases and things like that|agent:righ[t]- right exactly	where [noise]	1
agent:[noise]	[noise] well i think Don that maybe immigration is more of an issue in my part of the country than it is in yours do you suppose that's true	1
user:uh|agent:uh-huh|agent:yeah	unfortunately i think that that	1
agent:parents or grandparents came to uh the United States you know people from Italy|agent:of people who ca[me]- you know whose|agent:population of like second and third generation Americans	uh-huh	1
agent:far too much for what we get i mean it's just|agent:sure we pay far too much in taxes well|agent:[noise]	um-hum	1
agent:right [vocalized-noise] i don't mind them getting what they need it's just when they pay so much for it it takes very you know very little to just shop around and|user:you know ten or fifteen i mean that kind of thing and uh|agent:[laughter]	[vocalized-noise]	1
user:uh-huh|user:exactly|user:sure	exactly yeah that's the whole thing now they've gotten this wonderful idea of not taking out as much taxes	0
agent:and people don't care anymore either p[eople]- people don't wanna go out to vote|agent:and|user:well [vocalized-noise] that's the whole thing i think people are getting so fed up with it now we go through another election and listen to all these lies about the	no no	0
user:and|agent:[laughter]|user:maybe it'll have to be just individual state tax	each state take care of itself	1
user:i don't feel like that's as big a problem i've had|agent:um-hum|user:well i don't have so much trouble with products as service	a few answering machines over the last two years just because i've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly	0
user:so we got the kind we wanted|agent:um-hum|user:nothing's guaranteed so do it anyway	and i was really disappointed with that i felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable	1
agent:are very understanding and uh they usually get you know they they make things very they make s[ure]- make sure things are set properly if you're in any way dissatisfied with their merchandise|agent:they are um they're very good about um insuring like the customer's always right and you know [vocalized-noise] no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they|agent:i guess Bean's one of Bean's big competitors is Lands' End out in uh i guess it's Wisconsin somewhere they	that's really good it used to be like that	0
user:could say that|user:i guess i could|user:[noise]	i know how none i know how America comes across to	1
user:i'm sure that the perception in other places is that these guys are a bunch of bullies|user:uh|user:might makes right and money makes right and uh	uh	1
user:totally uh colored by|user:uh my impression of Latins was was|user:Latins has been governed by when i grew up in California and certainly here you are in Texas uh	the fact that i there were a lot of uneducated Mexicans	0
user:i i met some people who were|user:uh|user:twenties uh well when i was in [noise] in Hong Kong i found uh	totally white blonde haired people from i think it was Uruguay	1
user:you're equating|user:[noise]|user:got all over me because uh she said you're	the fact that my accent uh that i have a Spanish accent with no vocabulary and so i guess what i'm [noise] leading up to is to say that i'm sure they're getting very tired of us not taking them seriously	1
agent:right|user:yeah it's as a matter of fact they recently in our county here our state sales tax has been seven percent|user:hm	pretty much forever well they've just decided now when our county where i am is looking at	1
agent:yeah|user:people complaining you know well it was only saving two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year it's jus[t]- we're paying good tax money for this and|user:put it into effect and then suddenly of course you know ever since every day in the newspaper here it's	they turned it off yet they're still giving money to all these	0
user:yeah we're|agent:small but small but uh i got it back anyway|agent:i and i just i actually had filed earlier and i got my refund tonight actually	[noise]	0
user:i|user:what twelve years ago or something when i got my first computer|user:daily finances uh the uh w[ay]- way back	did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and you know checkbooks an[d]- all those kind of thing and we kept that going for about a month and it became so onerous that we gave up on it [laughter]	1
user:um|agent:right|user:you know just to see whether or not we're falling you know getting ahead falling behind or s[taying]- staying even or what	that's	1
agent:at this point because there's no other way to do it and my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support [laughter] so right now i know what i'm getting from the state and um i have to balance more or less|agent:so uh right now we're on we get fr[om]- you know aid from the state|user:oh i see uh-huh	oh dear	1
user:yeah you're the first you -[kn]ow uh|user:uh-huh|agent:i guess we're in the situation that a lot of Am[ericans]- you know middle class Americans are in	my next door neighbor	0
agent:sure|user:uh hang on one second i've got [noise]|agent:ah	[vocalized-noise]	0

agent:um-hum|user:until he quit there and started his own company|user:i he was an outstanding salesman at IBM i've read [laughter]	which he later sold out to General Motors and	1
agent:you know i mean i'm sure it takes a lot of money as well|agent:it it just takes a really huge investment in personal effort not just|agent:um	oh yeah [laughter]	1
agent:um-hum|user:certainly different i mean Bush is wealthy|user:yeah it's um	but nothing like [laughter-that]	1
agent:the information about other crimes the person has committed|agent:uh the jury may not even have|agent:right i i kind of agree with that because i think in some cases	right	1
user:Now|agent:i- i- i don't uh th[ere's]- there's a point on which we don't agree i would|user:yes	um-hum	1
user:the take|agent:the award|user:um-hum	right	0
agent:my view there for those two|user:right|user:right	yeah bu[t]- well you can tell i haven't been in too many [laughter-juries]	1
user:[noise]|user:actually you know i've been involved in electronics a long time uh|user:[noise]	in computers and i have have really resisted the	0
agent:i've found that most of homework assignments um at the level i'm at really require some sort of computer uh simulation or analysis so|agent:and uh i've found i've found that i pretty much become addicted to it and i can't really|agent:couple of years now which i've been trying continually upgrading i guess	hm	1
user:yes E-mail is probably pulls down|agent:yeah do you use E-mail and like that|agent:yeah	a third of all my time	1
agent:um-hum|user:are available and it's nice i really don't use it myself|user:i like it yeah i like it from a distance really i- i see the packages on it uh that	um	0
user:but|user:of universal service sometimes sounds real good|user:notion of a um	i i sometimes wonder whether it's	0
agent:um-hum|user:France that have universal service|user:i don't know on the other hand there are other countries like Switzerland and Israel and	uh you know which are democracies	1
user:having to take orders from a man and who knows what and [vocalized-noise]|user:you know|agent:um	uh	1
user:that it meant something to you in order|user:in other words you had to first show|agent:sure	to to have the right to say what ought to happen	1
user:<b_aside>|agent:i i think it has a lot of potential but i don't think that we're going to ever see something like that get through in this country because of the|agent:yeah	but i can't get one right now <e_aside>	1
user:you know whether companies wanna do this and i know that companies do like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested i know a couple of corporations that are doing that|user:um|user:i could certainly see it being done but in general	um so you know they kind of have gotten into the idea that let's drug test them and let's put them through rehab	0
user:like i said they have a large responsibility over a mass of people|user:just at the work place unless of course|user:uh when you get into drug testing people	uh	0
user:exactly|user:sure|agent:uh financial benefits associated with having you know having people file fewer claims being sick	the only thing is	1
user:you know how can you|agent:well well the ques[tion]-|user:where you say to somebody i'm gonna drug test you tomorrow so please do not take these medications or where's	how can you do it	1
user:and you've taken|user:uh let's say you do come out positive|user:of some sort even though they usually have you at the time list what medications you've taken	Advil or any of the Ibuprofen products out there or you've had a cold and you've been on medication or whatever you come out	0
user:can that uh if it does come out positive the first time|user:and it's a they|agent:um	they need to go back and find out	0
user:tell you what we can do is uh|user:[noise]|agent:barely got home from the university	i can punch the uh one	0
user:i['m]- i'm probably in the minority i- i actually|user:i'm afraid i'm|user:but um	don't think that we uh pay too much in this country	0
user:form|user:fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from a federal|user:um i just finished	and the sales tax can't	0
user:but i guess when i hear whe[n]- when i|user:right [noise]|agent:create any new taxes	see the comparison between	0
agent:what we pay for it|agent:are certainly well worth uh|user:yeah	uh-huh	1
agent:because they're something you theoretically can do something about|agent:[noise] i think the other problem is you know it's it's easy to complain about taxes|user:yeah	right	1
user:countries like Canada and England and Germany|user:on our part because|user:i think it's a dumb decision	do perfectly well with a uh two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools for the with the same tax money	1
user:in areas that are fairly well off|agent:[laughter]|user:i do thi[nk]- yeah that's true i think in places i think in places like California people are beginning to find that in	if you add the um	0
user:yeah|user:right|agent:of course i think with the graying of America we're gonna see that problem in lots of places	people would rather um increase the fire department and cut down the schools [laughter] because_1 it means more to them	0
user:um-hum|user:um-hum|agent:i feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care dental and vision as well as good long term and short term disability plans uh goes a long way toward satisfying my needs	well i'll tell you i think that is the most important thing [laughter] i've uh i'm not working right at the moment but the company that i did work for	0
agent:right|user:thank God i had|user:although i do have a pension that i'm drawing from them which	but uh man i think those medical benefits are the most important	1
user:[laughter]|agent:yeah|user:y[eah]- yeah right [laughter] oh you've got a cold go home and take uh liquids and uh rest	but um	1
agent:for Unix based workstations|user:um-hum um-hum|agent:they we do uh distributive system software	um-hum	1
agent:and that's exceedingly expensive|agent:and|user:right	yes it was over three hundred fifty dollars a month if we wanted to continue our own benefits	0
user:yeah right|agent:and you know of course they can use the excuse well we're a start-up|agent:there	but you know what's happening is the disability plan you know so many people are lying about their things God there's been big articles in the paper about that	1
agent:uh-huh|user:i see right from day one|agent:uh no sir not to my knowledge uh they've always had it	i'd have to confess to you that uh i don't know what the i honestly don't know what the law in Maryland is i think	1
user:and in many cases i decide|user:it's basically you know it wha[t]- what is the net the net benefit to society if you execute someone for a particular crime versus say if you lock them up for the rest of their lives or something of that sort|user:callous but uh	in favor of capital punishment in fact i think in most cases [laughter]	0
agent:uh murder was ra[mpant]- i mean uh horse horse thieving and|agent:is that|user:um-hum	um	1
agent:right um-hum|user:uh it's not a Quaker state or something of that sort you know like you know Pennsylvania|agent:yeah right	but uh	1
user:what|agent:um-hum right|user:you know and i- i- i think i'd have to sit down and say well what kind of contribution would they make and also what	do you	0
agent:and uh|agent:you know|user:um-hum	[noise]	1
user:i guess if i had to rate it from one to ten i guess i would rate it a five in the aspect that i wouldn't want everybody to have guns and i think there should be limitations of|user:[noise] okay um|agent:[noise]	like semiautomatics uh things like that should not be just given out to anybody in fact	0
agent:i definitely think that there some things shouldn't be limited like like you said rifles and|agent:um|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
user:you know i i think of my family uh they're very much into sporting and uh|user:but um|agent:right	you know as far as hunting and also like uh clay pigeons	0
user:um|agent:right|agent:yeah	i guess i i was always taught number one a gun isn't a toy	0
agent:right|user:and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy and of course we were quite young and we went through uh|agent:right	the National Rifle uh Club	0
user:sure|agent:but and i knew we had the guns in the house and the the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time [noise] but we it was never my brothers and sisters nor i never i mean none of us ever thought well let's go look at the gun or let's go get the gun out it was just something you knew was there and the it was your father's and you you that was not something you'd go and play played with at all|user:um-hum	yeah	1
agent:right|user:out here in Rochester we i also get the morning paper here um we we're Gannett town so we have a morning and a afternoon paper both owned by Gannett|agent:yeah	i tend to read the morning paper just because it's more	0
agent:um-hum|user:because i- i just despise fluff journalism|user:lately has become the newspaper	you know i mean Iraq is bombed but no you're not going to see that today because	0
agent:[noise]|agent:[laughter]|user:oh yeah it's th[ey]- they have A Letter From America i think it's Alastair Cooke	who um who's been doing that program forever who comments on what life in America is like and uh	1

agent:right hm|agent:[noise]|user:[noise] regarding uh taxes i'm you know taxes are really a necessary evil in in a civilized society but really people get upset at taxes because you it's more efficient to do things yourself	and uh and so as as a result uh you know it's it's a trade-off you know for the common good you know for for the benefit of others	0
agent:[noise] [laughter-right]|user:and uh probably a good woman right|agent:uh-huh	[laughter] just you know just just con somebody to take care of me and the[n]- a[nd]- and then you don't have to be on the tax roll	1

user:um|agent:it's hard to explain to them why you can't|agent:yeah	we just kind of have everything here and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are	0
user:for everything|user:uh they've always done this you know i mean it's always been the same but it is it's getting worse and worse there's more pressure|user:yeah and and i have older children too that now are out of high school and	and i just think it's really awful and i i'm with you on that you don't hear too many people say this but i think it's a very long day	0
agent:oh my gosh|agent:[noise] oh my gosh|user:so what does that tell you the it tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time	and they could be using this time better	1

agent:be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to|agent:well that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it'd|agent:hum	um-hum	1
agent:right|user:then i can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing you have to do so much as far as in a community service now|user:they may have problems but there are other people out in the community that may have problems	if they were you know the abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse	0
user:strike out and do their crimes or whatever|user:effected when they|user:there is a whole community that i[s]- is	and that's i think they have done that and judges have said well	0
agent:the thing is that it's not enough of that kind of stuff going on uh|agent:yeah but uh|user:yeah	yeah	1
user:physically assaulted somebody|user:you know but then again those that have|agent:um-hum	um that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program	1
user:i think extend beyond the normal|user:uh you know the lawyers these lawyer groups get together and they uh they|user:i i i really feel that the that the law enforcement community uh you know puts these people behind bars and then they they uh	uh appeal process	0
agent:and it's it's really getting out of [hanters/hand] in mo[st]- many states|agent:maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find|agent:and because of	well [noise] the term technicality the the the law enforcement community	0
user:uh you know a a non a non critical|user:or whether there's just you know a policeman has just made a uh|user:um but [noise]	e[rror]- error though be it not the right way to do it but but you know the the merits of the case in terms of	0

user:so|user:in the business community or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family|user:business wise um	you know if you do have any time it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done	0
user:um-hum|agent:i know that i have three children and um i stay home i don't work|user:and she's growing fast and	uh-huh	1
user:um-hum|agent:um really detecting this but i can talk to the teacher and tell them on a pretty good basis after i've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids go to day care and which kids stay home|agent:um i'm not educated at all in	sure sure	1
user:in fact um i spent the first three years at home with my daughter so i- i guess i felt|user:i think so too|user:i agree to a	fairly fortunate that i was able to do that and i did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in day care and i thought to myself how can a mother	1
agent:right|user:uh were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision well jeez you know i'll go out and get a part time job got a part time job and then financially they got themselves into well i'll have the boat i'll have the car and it's nice|user:uh like my husband was saying maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties	and really women past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too	0
EMPTY	[noise]	0
agent:um not that often because a lot of things get stolen|user:yeah it's probably p[ays]- pays for you to leave something there do you do you do that|agent:you know [laughter-so]	really	1
agent:oh that happens a lot i know my aunt was director she just retired was director of nurses at the hospital up here|agent:[laughter]|user:you know i guess i guess from the school [vocalized-noise] this is just not professional you know [laughter] so i'm kind of a hold out [laughter]	yeah	1

agent:that's right [laughter]|user:um a long time not because of any great desire to like wow we're just going to buy American because it's American [laughter]|user:but uh you know we've been we've been we've been an American car family for the most part for	[laughter-but]	0
agent:and the American cars the uh one advantage one a[dvantage]- one big advantage they still have is you can typically find them for a lot less|agent:[laughter-great] yeah well Chrysler is supposed to be when if you're looking at reliability Chrysler's supposed to be one of the best American cars right now|agent:[noise]	yeah	1
agent:um|user:uh this little city is only about eight thousand people|agent:could could be	so	1
agent:as it is a is definitely a problem and|user:um-hum um-hum|agent:has made some places safer but y[ou]- you know it's very difficult i mean if you don't have an infinite amount of money to to try to stop the problem although most people wish you could	um-hum	1
user:yeah i know when i lived in Oakland it was just that uh|agent:it's just that too many people argue about how to fix it|agent:and something you know something has to be done but	like i definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of of the city by myself	0
agent:you know it's just uh it's just not right something|user:i know|agent:the just the even the random occurrences where you know it's unsafe for a woman just to walk from their car to the some in certain areas like from from the car from their car to the mall or something and it's dangerous and it's just that's just ridiculous and	yeah i mean	0
user:a career|user:not a broad base of subjects but rather trying to concentrate them on particular subject areas that they think they might be interested in going into|user:uh in order to go into this sort of specialized curriculum where uh we're teaching kids	uh about and the problem comes about if these people aren't well rounded students or graduates	0
agent:rejecting things on that basis you end up handing uh everybody's papers back that's probably what we should have done|agent:i mean you start|agent:yeah i remember i- i was quite surprised [noise] at uh	[noise]	1
agent:right they need smaller discussion|user:[laughter] thing and say i don't know what you're talking about they're going to just keep their mouth shut [laughter]|agent:no	and i think you know it's those kinds of things that	1

agent:um-hum|user:and that was kind of a very interesting uh experience that i had and i'm sure that part of me would like to go back and do that it's kind of like for trout fishing|user:but um when i was growing up my father kind of introduced me to fly fishing	and i'm sure someday i'll probably get back but uh at the current time	0
agent:i had a chance to go to uh Alaska for six weeks last summer and did some|agent:yeah|user:catch some uh fish so	oh gosh yeah	1
agent:um-hum|user:well i've also noticed i don't know the best time of the year for fishing uh in this area is right after the winter and the ice is been on and it's real cold water|agent:yeah	but it seems like if you go fishing like in the middle of the summer when it's hot and humid	0
user:um|user:and less maybe water like in the spring we have lots of rain coming in|user:whether the ponds here aren't that deep or the water just changes and it gets busier and more people are out on the lakes	there's a big difference in you know fishing too	0
agent:[noise]|user:a lot of companies now are are using uh drug testing uh paraphernalia and drug testing situations to|user:[noise] um [noise]	to root out the	0
user:unless you really go into a deep background of course we're [vocalized-noise] being involved in my organization|user:that's difficult|user:and and i- i feel as though uh that uh uh you know that if you you are a drug user you have a hidden agenda	uh	0
agent:yeah|user:then maybe there is no hope [laughter]|user:and there isn't anything but getting stoned or high is is the only thing in life that seems be meaningful	what's your uh feeling	1
agent:oh yeah well that's why there's you know why there's people dealing it because there's money in it you know there's a ridiculous amounts of money in it|user:yeah i i m[ust]- must admit that the the production costs of of these drugs are are {zippo} compared to the street market costs and the|agent:but yeah get um	and the costs to society	0
agent:oh my i- i wish there was a way to to pick uh people who|user:okay what do you think about our politicians [laughter]|agent:[noise]	[laughter]	1
user:yeah really and then it seems like they bring out [vocalized-noise] all the dirt that they can bring out about a person|agent:[vocalized-noise] sell your soul it seems like to|agent:you have to um	you know s[tuff]- oh stuff that happened many years ago in their lives i think that's	0
agent:yes Agnus|user:oh the one that just got out of Agnus uh-huh|agent:uh	um-hum	1

EMPTY	[noise] uh i don't know my personal perception of government and uh the way things are at this current time is that nobody can really be trusted	0
user:the new uh|user:escapade that they had with uh|agent:[noise]	oh God chief of uh well Supreme Court	0
user:so|user:uh that can get into government even if they were poor|user:Abraham Lincolns out there	i know that's my personal viewpoint of	0
user:and of course they think uh Wisconsin our neigh[bor]- or Minnesota our neighbor|user:is thinking about oh we need to reform the health uh system|user:right now every little state around here	passed	0
agent:i think the one of the biggest problems that uh we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself|agent:well i-|agent:right	uh-huh oh sure	1
user:i've done it but oh boy [laughter] and it's not going to get out|agent:[laughter]|user:yeah [laughter] well that's exactly what happens in government [laughter] all the time hey blow the whistle on each other oh i hear that you're doing this	ex[actly]- yeah e[xactly]- exactly it's uh	0
user:uh we really don't have too much of a problem as far as uh industry|user:we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution i think Grand Rapids was number one|agent:[noise]	you know since we're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here	0
user:as this acid rain continues to fall and i know that there's been battles over the states up here|agent:right|user:uh or alkaline liking plants are j[ust]- not lasting anymore because the soil levels the p H is changing	uh you know Governor Mario going after you know governors of Ohio and and Indiana to fix	0
agent:a[ir]- air pollution i mean|agent:but i you know you['ve]- you've got you've got the industry you've got that and you got the cars and i think the cars are where where it's at right now as far as pollution goes|agent:going up in the atmosphere	yeah	0

agent:right|user:yeah [noise] you kind of goes into your privacy and [noise]|user:yeah	you know but i guess if they you know you know there's uh i i guess there's some companies that aren't [noise] that are doing it	0
user:yeah|agent:where uh like a lot of people are saying well i only smoked a joint last night i don't have any problems [laughter-you] [laughter-know] or something like that yeah|user:yeah	and then i kind of hear it goes into like uh this is just	0
agent:uh-huh|user:personal life you know and|user:yeah that's where i kind of get into cause it's just kind of gets into your	it's like wha[t's]- what's kind of next	1
agent:hopefully we won't [laughter]|agent:you know|user:we haven't either	oh yeah but i- i- i just kind of think it's heading that way though you know it's just [noise] because it's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff and i just	0
user:i guess uh i think they've lost their compass and uh|user:uh|agent:upset about	i'm not sure they know exactly what uh	1
user:everybody cares about the|user:that's one thing|user:one hundred percent of the uh customers care	education the kids are getting	1
user:pay attention and participate and|user:um|user:um	and you can	1
user:i guess my evidence for that is the|user:and|user:really a problem with the culture	school districts in places like	0
user:i think that's a a loss of civic virtue and a loss of um [noise] uh|agent:right|user:they don't have kids in the schools	the	1
agent:right|user:education for civic participation the idea was that|user:added afterwards [noise] i think the real the principal reason was uh	everybody should have an education so that they'd be a better voter	0
user:i'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know|user:and um|user:now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is um an economic enterprise to um train people for jobs	what their purpose is	0
agent:oh you laugh how many what ages [laughter]|user:yeah [laughter]|user:[noise]	the hat	1
user:when mine were growing up i did some traveling and but not that extensively|user:yeah well|agent:it's i i'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way in the way it's done now and then [laughter]	but i always uh just made it a point to you know try to spend about ten minutes with each one of them	1
agent:you know by the time i pick them up and get them home and get them fed i have very little time each evening maybe thirty minutes max|agent:but that's [vocalized-noise] well both my husband and i work and sometimes i feel like|user:well yeah yeah	yeah	1
agent:going the other direction this weekend we're planning a trip just he and i this is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids since she was born four and a half years ago|agent:and we do a lot of family things together we're we're kind of|user:right	well that's good too [laughter]	0
user:discuss everything|user:[noise]|agent:and what would you do what	that didn't agree with them_1 and we'd take turns being president	1
user:never had to attend|user:and they|agent:now that's good i like that idea	but if if they missed it they had to abide by the rules	1
user:and your husband|agent:oh why is that|user:but uh boy i- i feel for you	well	0
user:so it's really my parents and i have five children|user:like tons and tons of relatives|user:uh i was an only child my mother is an only child so we don't have	three are married and they have little kids	1
user:uh it's really hard to get everyone together|user:he's a teacher and he had things he had to do and he couldn't just leave but|user:that's the hard part is was my son was missing last week because	but we don't have lots of	1
agent:we've had them at resorts uh you know smaller resort places uh|agent:and|user:so you go camping do you i see well that's kind of good	uh-huh	1
agent:twelve of them_1 or fourteen of them_1 or something like that not all of them_1 are living still but there's probably eight or nine that still are|agent:oh i don't know there's|agent:and their	hum	1
agent:um-hum|user:well there's uh places in Wisconsin there's the Apostle Islands um|agent:were you up in in Wisconsin or would you go into Can[ada]- where would you camp hum	which are in Bayfield which is a wonderful place	0
agent:four kids my brother and myself and|agent:my dad would take uh|user:sure	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah|agent:but|user:i[t]- it it's with kids we don't care if they take a shower everyday with kids we don't care you know uh a lo[t]- about a lot of things but as adults uh it's like if i don't take a shower every day i feel like you know ooh i- i- i just don't feel right so	uh there's lots of places if you're gonna go camping KOA's are wonderful it's kind [laughter-of] it's kind of the uh	0
user:uh|agent:uh-huh|user:if you're gonna be gone all day long walking someplace or uh doing tourism or whatever	you're camping really is just for like in the evening to start the fire to sit back and watch a fire uh to enjoy that you know and then to get up in the morning and get a shower and get cleaned up that kind of stuff so we never really spent that much time	1
agent:and simple majority won't do|user:yep i|agent:yeah i mean it's to to easy to get a quorum	no and e[ven]- even like you know	0
agent:[laughter-yeah] no doubt|agent:whose to say|user:yeah it to be there'd be much more of that	[laughter]	1
agent:and who can argue their case better|user:yep [laughter]|agent:i'm sure of it because_1 a lot of those things it's all it's in it's largely a matter of viewpoint	[laughter]	1
agent:yeah|agent:but uh|user:yeah but it's for the more general people don't want to take responsibility	you know that's a	1
agent:and we already have too many lawyers as it is|agent:you know to try to get them all in in a good time|user:i know [laughter]	yeah and if it's criminal cases we you can't put them_1 in jail because there's no room left	1
agent:but uh that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately|user:um-hum|agent:to actually manage to get into space someday	[laughter] what do you do now	1
agent:uh-huh|user:plans to uh go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to uh the sixties|user:although	um	0
agent:some sort of uh solar power satellites up|agent:would be to have uh|agent:one of the long term solutions that at least a few of our problems	um-hum	1
agent:uh glitz and show factor|agent:it it would be do[ne]- it would be being done for the|user:um-hum	um-hum	1
agent:i'm not sure there was the big one uh earlier in the week in uh California that o[n]- on and off and on and off [noise] um|agent:uh|user:put to death	um	0
agent:yeah|user:[noise] you know i understand you need to prove without a shadow of a doubt that the guilt and whatnot but the appeal process of it i think is what really bugs me if you're gonna make it go so long you know what's the use of it|user:the process itself gets so drug out and so	it almost becomes more	0
user:and that's why you know like i say a part of my thing with the whole appeal process kind of bugs me because_1 here they have sat for|agent:yeah|user:a[nd]- and like i said if it took about thirteen years for it to happen and the other guy is still sitting on death row you know fourteen fifteen years later	you know fifteen years and i- i wonder about the families of the people who are the victims you know and they've got to be a little bit upset themselves and	1
agent:[noise] well that's the that's the thing here in here i[n]- here in Texas we've had a couple of cases in the last [noise] one one was a was a murder case where it was|user:uh|agent:yeah	[noise]	1
user:you know my|agent:[noise]|user:[noise] okay um i haven't been in this situation [laughter-yet]	my parents are	0

agent:treat them_1 like that|agent:do things with them_1 and treat them_1|user:yeah [noise]	and i'm sure it's it's expensive	1
user:and she she she really does love that but she's just concerned about|user:where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go|user:and then they have um	i[n]-	1
user:because i- i remember her in her letters telling me she|agent:fact i|user:so uh	she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat so i'm assuming it's something like that too so	1
user:well she lives she lives in a house on her own|user:is|user:my husband's grandmother	and she doesn't really need the care or anything like that but	1
agent:exactly recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever|user:felons i think should also|agent:right	yeah	1
agent:there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build|agent:sure and it's like you know that's a big problem but|user:re[peat]- uh repeat offenders being let out and doing it again	um-hum	1
agent:oh okay great what program you in|user:i'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas|agent:what do you do Georgeanne	um Audiology	1

user:okay|agent:um-hum|user:B L Y	great	1
agent:uh always trying to understand people|user:okay|agent:uh materials	um-hum	1
agent:Max Lucado|user:Max Lucado|agent:and uh	yeah	1
user:out of their paycheck for the same insurance that we're getting|user:uh i don't know why the post people post office people pay one third|user:okay uh basically i work for the government and our health insurance plan seems to be okay but it seems the benefits are are eroding and the cost of insurance goes up	uh right now i'm in we're physicians health plan and that costs about thirty five bucks a paycheck	0
user:and i'm sure there's a lot of people that live paycheck to paycheck to where they cannot|user:Saturday afternoon you're playing baseball and you break your arm you don't know what it's going to cost you for the x-rays and everything else like that if you don't have some type of health plan that you can afford|user:i agree there because_1 i you know	[vocalized-noise] and afford fifty bucks every paycheck for a health insurance plan	0
agent:yeah i- i- i- i|user:you know the consumer is going to pay in the end no matter what happens so|user:um	[vocalized-noise] cost hidden or not	1
agent:the budget i stuck on the most|user:that just kind of seems to be the way it works|user:you know i just [laughter]	pardon me	1
agent:no not really|user:oh do you think this is going to change the way you budget your money in any way|agent:uh i will be a week from next Monday	have you kind of discussed this already with your fiancee	1
agent:yeah|agent:uh you know got a few other miscellaneous automatic deductions|agent:uh that cou[ld]- you know so that's even more and then i've also uh	which i think is really the easiest way to save because once you have the money in your hand in the check you'll think oh well i just won't put anything	0
agent:[noise]	okay_1	0
user:um|user:like um should it be that way or should it be|user:um and i think the topic was	up to the people or	1
user:yeah you can|agent:maybe you get a bad bunch or [laughter-what] [laughter-ever] and they uh|agent:one reason or another just	you can	0
agent:reducing a rape case without a firearm or without a weapon to uh just practically a misdemeanor|agent:now which is uh|user:uh-huh	oh really	0
user:i don't know but then again i guess it takes up a lot of your taxpayers money and time|user:um|agent:um-hum	and um	0
user:and uh|user:they had something very similar to that|agent:yeah	and that's real scary too you know i mean	1
agent:how do you mean|user:that's what comes to mind anyway|user:the priority that's given to kids [laughter]	[laughter]	0
user:um|user:so i think that uh and i think we're sort of reaping the|agent:yeah	results of that in uh	0
agent:so we sort of grew up together and um just had children uh so we have a four year old and a two year old|agent:um [noise] we've been married uh twenty two years|agent:yeah my wife and i have gone through a couple of decades together we're both on our early forties	um-hum	1
agent:um-hum|user:until they were uh well into school|user:have somebody home	it's difficult espec[ially]- it's not so much	1
user:but i really feel like it's been worth it for the kids and when i look around i think uh|agent:um-hum|user:professionally identified and that sort of thing	i'm i'm pretty glad we made the decision we did	1
user:um|user:to sort of uh put a cap on things that you can really have and enjoy and just go ahead and uh|user:um	do what's right by your	0
agent:uh you know think they're poor if they can't get a Polo shirt every week [laughter]|agent:uh you know the the kids around here|user:stuff in the eighties	um-hum right	1
agent:i was a systems analyst for an oil company|user:hm|agent:oh my chances of getting another job are just really slim	right	1
agent:well i agree with you but do you know that's that's what makes this such a tremendous benefit if you can possible get group rates|user:suing left and right and just driving these costs up|user:well i think the whole thing with this health insurance being so high is because people are	well i- i have my own beef about health insurance i uh	0
user:to buy into it to pay ourselves just to get the lower rate that a group would have|user:why can't they allow their substitutes|user:yeah i suppose and um i do substitute teach and my biggest complaint is schools get a discount insurance school districts because they have so many people	and they won't let us	1
agent:are they paying a part of the premium|user:but|agent:is uh let's see	well i they're paying all the premium for their full-time teachers	1
user:i myself almost um|user:yeah i-|agent:testing for random drugs	am in favor of it	0
agent:yeah|user:you know and that kind of thing|user:i don't know almost the goodness of character	where do you work	1
agent:yeah|user:the drug tests assure u[s]- they're accurate but there's always that margin of error|user:yeah and that that definitely happens you know i mean those	and that's that's something to be aware of	0
user:types although|user:um i'm sure they screen for just a particular few|user:uh you know i know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something	the literature they give with you says yeah we do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for	1
user:or the whole drug testing thing|user:they uh even for interns they they do the whole random drug|user:but um	so	1
user:did the drug testing thing after that|user:and then uh|user:they essentially uh made me the offer and then	so uh it was one of those things where	0
user:yeah that's a good question i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave|agent:one ch[ance]- one more chance or two more chances|agent:wha[t]- what happens if you were to fail then do they give you like	uh	0
user:okay|agent:uh no i'm just about to finish my masters in May|user:wha[t]- are you working right now anywhere or	oh okay great	1
agent:okay|user:no no that's one thing they don't do is is drug testing while you're on the job|agent:do do they test you at right now at work too	uh i think	0
user:and uh|agent:um-hum|user:you know smoking a joint or whatever	you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up	0
agent:um-hum|user:familiar with the politics that involved with that and that being passed|user:in that aspect uh as far as like now the new health bill that went through Minnesota uh being that it is their neighboring state and that i lived in Minnesota and more	but um as far as politics in the grander uh	1
agent:a contender within the party is is to have done all those things|agent:that was a requirement of being a|agent:and and up unto the point of uh Perot being a serious candidate it seems like that	um-hum sure	1
agent:um-hum|user:the people that were going to be paying your way um|user:you had to have the views of	so it makes the common person uh not to say that a common person couldn't run for government and do a a fabulous job because he's got people	0
agent:[laughter-yeah]|agent:but|user:whether or not uh you know you look at all these candidates that want to become President i really have to ask them why you know	um	1
agent:a retirement home|agent:and the churches have banded together and built and staffed|user:um-hum	that's wonderful	1
user:unfortunately having her come live with us|user:um|user:that she can't take care of herself	you know if she needs constant care is not going to be an option	1
user:well yes that's for certain my my mom lives in a small town also and i know you know the funds just aren't available|agent:and actually a great deal more money [laughter]|agent:yes	uh to do something	1
agent:but is there some reason i wonder why we couldn't have some of these people involved|agent:uh you know they're talking about work fare now in uh Wisconsin i believe it is|agent:[noise] of course this is kind of a far flung situation but	[vocalized-noise]	1
agent:well you called here [laughter-so]|agent:[noise]|user:[noise] have you any thoughts	okay well	0
user:you know and and allocated towards the AIDS research i think that AIDS research has been|user:uh|user:uh subjects	a a a lot of the funding has not been done by the government a lot of it has been done by	0
agent:and that people really didn't groups didn't wanna be associated with it because it was a morals issue|user:uh-huh|agent:there wasn't a lot of private dollars around because of the stigma of the disease	right	1
agent:which have fundamentalists in charge of the thing who won't even let you say condom in a meeting|user:um-hum|agent:which uh makes it turn into a political issue now you see the problem is you have people in the National Institutes of Health in Atlanta and the like the Centers for Disease Control	right	1
agent:so|user:uh-huh|agent:[noise] um well i'm just really excited about it because_1 i'm graduating from college next month and i hope to be buying a car sometime [laughter] in the future	[noise]	1
agent:so|user:hm|agent:yeah that is really cute that's true	are are you working yet	1

agent:the national and international news i feel|agent:which has very good uh coverage of|user:huh	um	1
agent:um-hum|user:an[d]- and i've just recently decided to home with my children and so [laughter-it] seems as if i catch the news [rise/right] right as it ha[ppens]- happens you know there was|user:if i've missed something and	uh the explosions and that kind of thing my husband will say how'd you know about that and i said yes it happened at such and such time and that's so that that's different for me	0
agent:um-hum|user:the whole story or more of the story|user:right it kind of gives you	that kind of thing	1
agent:when you have young children right|user:so i can sit back and watch it and it's pretty interesting um|user:you know i try and and uh tape them if i'm out or that kind of thing i try and tape them and	um-hum	1
agent:so|user:um-hum|user:hm	sure	1
user:to me i would like to see a lot more money being put|user:to look at other than here so it's kind of like|user:resource for us to	toward taking care of the environment that we have here	0
user:you know who would have cared about earth it would have been another planet to kind of take over and uh continue on so|user:if we would have went into space and found Mars a livable pl[anet]- uh planet we probably would have inhabited it and uh|user:uh	you know and that	0
user:you know the earth|user:um|user:shuttle some day and uh just see	and the different planets and things like that i i think it would be very interesting to do but whether it'd be feasible to do i don't know	1
user:you know an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the|user:there's uh you know they're trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create|agent:uh-huh	desert part of it and then they have an area that's more um you know full of	0
user:uh|agent:right|user:you know in the aspect that we see it	and never seeing uh you know light bright days you know and uh	1
agent:you know clearly by the fact of the resources that are controlled by the region|user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:and i think it's you know motivated	[vocalized-noise]	0
agent:yeah|user:a very powerful Israeli lobby in this country|user:uh Arab nations uh while basically succumbing to	and i- i think that the Palestinian question is a key to a lot of problems in the region	1
user:paying lip service to the Palestinians|user:by basically you know|user:because you know we set the stage and how we've dealt with that issue in such a poor manner	in the past	0
agent:you know so you might as well not even try|user:yeah|agent:a fanatic will believe in X Y Z and you're never going to change that	i suspect that we'll probably in uh with the demise of the Soviet Union formation of Russia whatever ends up coming out of that	0
user:but uh i you know Tunisia|user:Islamic wise it's not allowed the fundamentalist to gain control|user:the more moderate states uh even including Saudi Arabia which is a very religious country	and uh now we have problems with Sudan	0
agent:you know movement|user:[laughter]|agent:over the last ten years i mean basically people rejected you know there's [vocalized-noise] fundamentalist	yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:just recently had an experience with uh Sears uh do you have that down in Florida|user:i um	well Sears is kind of famous for taking back almost anything they're very good about it	0
user:you know i really expect you to do something about this|user:eight months out of a winter coat all the stitches were coming out it's a real mess|user:um this guy didn't get	and i hadn't really hang on to receipts or anything	0
user:but um i was very please and and it is true i uh you know generally they back up what they have and|agent:yeah|user:and i think it's how you conduct yourself as well if if you're kind of mean and nasty you get treated [laughter-mean] [laughter-and] [laughter-nasty]	it worked out nicely fortunately and	0
agent:a little black box that|user:[vocalized-noise]|user:and it is and and they build this these little time bombs in so [laughter] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-so] you got to bring it back	huh	1
user:okay i'm here|agent:[noise]|user:[noise]	how do you feel about the public schools	1
user:when she was there|user:actually has two boys now but only had one|user:and uh she has a young boy	and	0
user:for example i have a brother in North Carolina|agent:um-hum|user:i know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good	and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad um just terrible	1
agent:and you're not at liberty|agent:two kids in that class that constantly keep the [ca/class] class in an uproar|agent:and when you have	yeah	1
user:sure you know teachers|user:i[t]- that|agent:uh especially in the inner schools inner city	you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school	1
agent:my son would be in private school we just cannot afford it|agent:if we could afford it|agent:well it it really is a concern of mine because	yeah	1
user:um paper plates and paper cups and i don't do that anymore i don't know why i just [laughter-don't] [laughter-i] [laughter-just] from|agent:[laughter]|user:i can kind of tell it bothers her so uh just unconsciously i've i've stopped buying a lot of um	just from socializing with her so	1
agent:so|user:uh-huh|agent:uh it didn't go through	but i heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee	0
agent:plastic goods they have this little number now that tells what kind of plastic it is|agent:have you noticed that on the bottom of|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:she lives in Garland and i'm not sure|agent:where does your friend go to recycle|user:you know talked about doing something like that	where what she does but she's uh oh she's	0
agent:uh-huh|user:you know the little um i don't know if you know the little character Barney they had one|user:and uh my little boy ha[s]- watches a program that was really neat i sat and watched him you know the Barney	uh	0
user:rather than to have one person be responsible|user:uh you know than e[ven]- having a unanimous decision|user:is better	i don't think that they could be objective in every case every time	1
agent:right|user:you know point blank in the crime|user:and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught	there's uh no question it's beyond a reasonable doubt	1
user:in in that regard i mean you know people who commit|agent:or or at least speeds them_1 up|user:well i know tha[t's]- that's what i'm saying but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up	uh crimes that they	0
user:like drunk drivers that kill people|user:i- i think they should i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever|agent:we do [laughter]	and um	1
user:i know that the [vocalized-noise]|agent:that was absurd [laughter] there was no there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence|agent:but um	uh-huh	1
agent:well i mean were there witnesses|user:kill you|user:i mean supposing i come up to you and i just point blank	in other words you're saying that we you have to find out whether it's premeditated or	0
user:is to be in a situation where you|user:in uh in dealing in a with a large company|user:but uh we[ll]- you know sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on and i- i- i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that uh anybody could get	you get to know what's going on and maybe that's that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do	0
user:but uh but basically uh there's lots of things that|user:for good reason|user:and uh and so well you know we we don't there's lots of things that we don't get told	that we should know	0
user:which i thought was kind of interesting|user:and everyb[ody]- all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do|user:but uh our organization is doing something else t[omorrow]- on Monday uh we're having a for all unclassified programs we're we're having little tables put out in front of you know lab in the hallways	and bu[t]-	1
user:but but regard to benefits you know most companies have|user:or if your management doesn't think that|user:you might not get told for months or you might you know if it doesn't impact you directly	most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and	0
user:and uh it's very much like the military it windows out you know you you think well boy i'm getting more money and i'm getting more responsibility i'm doing this but|user:uh as they get older to to most companies|user:to most uh	as you climb up that tree	0
agent:doctors and uh|agent:uh|agent:doesn't include our	hm	1
user:um and then i pay another five dollars for dental|agent:hm um-hum|user:and you know i end up i'm paying [laughter] like five dollars a month for health care coverage you know	um	0
agent:um-hum [noise] and and uh you know i[t]- it uh uh|agent:um-hum|user:um you know that they have to deal with horrible um you know PPOs or HMOs or something like that you know where you can't choose your own doctor and	and you	1
user:is that i you know i'm only twenty four twenty five right just turned twenty five and ten years ago i can remember when it was not common to see two people in a family or household working|user:the biggest social change that i've seen in the last ten years|agent:[noise]	and getting behind	0
agent:and it was actually quite and art form to see some of the you know older or or more experienced cashiers go you know fly through that is like those Japanese hippies see what the abacus is still|agent:yeah um-hum|user:with the greens buttons the rows and rows [laughter]	yeah	1
agent:well we're getting greedy i guess but uh well with regarding to your comment i- i have to agree with that too there's a prevalence of uh|agent:yeah w[e]-|agent:yeah hey same here same here	[vocalized-noise]	1
user:um-hum|agent:you're set for life [laughter]|agent:or IBM	not after AT&T's going to let go fifty thousand people i i'm uh constantly putting stuff up in [vocalized-noise] telecom	0
user:uh someone calls and|user:when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or or whatnot and you know next thing you know|agent:[noise]	wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to y[ou]- to tell them_1 you know that you're not interested or you do tell them_1 you're not interested and they still	0
agent:and uh while i was subscribing to the paper i got so upset at them that they you call me one more time i'm going to stop [laughter-subscribing]|user:[laughter]|agent:or or like the newspapers they just dial randomly or s[elect]- and stuff they even call the newspapers here even call people who already [laughter-subscribe]	uh-huh	1
agent:um-hum|user:um and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number|agent:um-hum	um	1
agent:uh you know they'll they have to eat the [laughter-charge]|agent:they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature and if they can't provide a signature|agent:the signature um	yeah well y[ou]-	1
agent:every now and then you know as|agent:send some|agent:not very often but they they do	what	1
agent:get off on sa[nity]- insanity on something like that which i i believe you know there's a certain degree of insanity there but that's certainly no[t]-|agent:at all up to date on that but you know if uh something like that if i[t]- if you can|agent:insanity there i don['t]- you know i'm i'm not	um-hum	1
agent:crime goes down [laughter] you y[ou]- you know|agent:you know they take a few criminals out in the public square and they execute them_1 and|agent:if i i think in Japan you know when crime gets bad they	[laughter]	1
user:i personally don't own one because i can't afford one|user:uh pressing in personal identification numbers all the ATM machines things like that|user:it's got some kind of computer interface like pressing on keyboards	uh every time you look in a friend's houses and they show you their computers and all the knickknacks they have it seems like they go from their basic computer to	0
agent:yeah|user:and use the Unix operating systems|agent:um-hum	use their VI editor and we use um read on line news through it	0
agent:um-hum|user:you know i like um i favor C shell over the other|user:yeah we can use System Five or we can use um C shell	i think i think most of our users like Bourne shell because_1 they were trained in it and they just don't wanna learn something different	1
agent:that the family the definition of family is changing a lot|agent:um|agent:important changes seems to be	yeah	1
agent:it seems to me it seems to me like um like everyone is lamenting you know the loss of the nuclear family|user:which is|user:it's really putting some constraints on your whole uh the whole lifestyle	um-hum	1
agent:people|agent:it makes for mo[re]- it makes for like two dependent|user:i'm	yeah	1
user:you know regardless of the of the social impact or the the familial impact you got to think about|user:um|agent:yeah it just seems that way	just the pragmatic side of it in terms of how can you afford to raise however many kids one or nine	0
user:exactly you know that's something my sister's having to face right now they've both got|agent:the big question is you know who how how do the kids get raised|agent:of course of course when both um parents are working	they've got working parents both of them and it's like they're always shuffling them_1 off to day care	0
user:uh-huh|agent:well let's see um i haven't gotten mine yet because my parents are getting all that stuff at um at home in the Bay area|user:well we just got our income tax return and i'm perfectly happy what about you [laughter]	uh-huh	1
user:so|user:and small and a child|agent:uh-huh	you know that that's a scary part too that you have to think about	0
user:there's gonna be a special this week i i can't i can't remember if it's Twenty Twenty or|user:you know the taxpayers are your m[oney]- is your money going to where you want it to go and|user:are your taxes	one of those things where um	1
agent:so everyone has everyone has the access to medical facilities as well as the doctors that sort of thing and|agent:like socialized medicine and things like that too which are nice fringe benefits of it|agent:but on the other hand they also whi[le]- while those countries that have high taxes also have things like um	um-hum	1
user:yeah|agent:to get you know i like to know where it's going to|user:um-hum	yeah	1
user:well my basic idea on dealing with the US budget as unrealistic and [laughter] as it may be|agent:[noise]	is to first of all put an end to	0
user:[laughter]|agent:and we've only got you know we only took in two hundred million dollars uh i realize that i'm off by a factor of about five but [laughter] we only took in two hundred million even though this year is going better we can still only spend two hundred million|agent:you know last year was a bad year	i- i just keep seeing unfortunately the p[roblem]- a lot of the problem why we have this deficits balloon especially during the eighties is just because the American people	0
agent:[laughter]|user:well yeah we have that out here in New York too you know with governor Mario King Mario and|user:[laughter]	the legislatures are opposing parties are controlled by opposing parties which means basically every year we have a scream and terrified over the budget	0
user:and then the rest you can ju[st]- you throw out and the town picks it up|agent:hm|user:you know like your Campbell soup cans and your milk cartons and that kind of stuff	i've heard of communities where you have to separate your garbage and then put what's left in a clear plastic [ga/bag] bag so they can kind of look and see if you're throwing out what [laughter-you] [laughter-shouldn't] i thought that was [laughter-pretty] [laughter-amusing]	1
user:and you find these old old men and these bag people collecting all these things and hauling them in in big garbage bags and they just like take up one of these machines to|agent:oh|user:and uh you push a button and you get a nickel for every can because_1 some[one]- you had to pay a deposit on it when you bought it	to get you know couple of mo[ney]- uh bucks for beer or [laughter-something]	1
agent:w[ell]- well|user:depending on how long it takes you to get to work|agent:about two two and a half hours of news a day	[laughter]	1
user:[noise]|agent:uh so now i'm saving trees and and uh|agent:yeah that was that was about it you know	[laughter]	1
user:to get it uh|user:maybe on the weekend but during the week i just really don't have the time in the morning|user:newspapers	and i'll listen to [vocalized-noise] news on the radio but just in the car radio going to and from work in between	0
agent:mail stuff you know the|user:yeah|agent:you know junk like that a little rack to hold the maps and you know	right	1
user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:sounds like a big project|user:stuff	uh yeah it is and i really haven't had time to do much with it	0
agent:had to have some kind of piddling to do all the time|agent:um so we're just and i just kind of|user:[vocalized-noise]	sure	0
agent:uh-huh|user:and so i- i helped him do some of that|user:a ceiling actually	and uh	1
user:and he'd made her bed and i was actually taking a look at it|agent:um-hum|user:um my girlfriend's father is also is also a contractor in terms of carpentry and stuff	and some of the stuff uh you could see the techniques that he used to reinforce uh the braces and things like that	0
agent:yeah|user:yeah they had to kind of use some uh some different renovative kind of techniques to do that with|user:right	where do you where do you live again	1
user:and uh|user:a duplex in Orlando|user:before i moved up to Minneapolis i- i lived in a	that had some work that had to be done with it some of the	0
user:um|user:i- i jus[t]- i i'm probably one that has to agree with it too|user:the um capital punishment and um	there're	1
agent:yeah|user:well maybe that's something that needs to be worked on but i i just feel that that|agent:you know	capital punishment needs to stay within the system	0
agent:um and he knew what he was doing and everything else i mean|agent:which is ridiculous and and the court found him competent|user:yeah	yeah	1
agent:yeah|user:it's not used that often|user:you know it's not	you know	0
agent:face the punishment|agent:and to say you know well if i kill somebody then a decade from now i might|user:um-hum	yeah	1
agent:put to death for that|agent:um y[ou]- you mean would he be|user:i don't know [laughter]	right	1
user:looking back on it i tend to think it was pretty uh|user:um|user:i guess	mostly a mistake	0
agent:ended up being i was in the last last lottery|user:um-hum|agent:i i was just uh in high school [noise] i guess when it when it ended	yeah	1
user:in the course of talking to him about it how uh|user:and i was thinking|agent:um-hum	in World War Two the personalties of Stalin Hitler and Churchill	0
agent:um-hum|user:otherwise there'd be uh they'd get you someplace else|user:and i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the uh early decisions in the Vietnam war that the uh [noise] people saw the cold war as uh you had to draw a line and and defend it	[noise] looking back it seems like that was only	1
user:just in order to um call the bully out and beat him|user:i don't think you can just fight anywhere just|user:brought the cold war to an end but	and i have a feeling that that's	0
user:a hopeless situation|user:really get into a|user:the more i can see each decision that was made as being understandable but the cumulative effect was to	where	0
agent:i mean they you know they seemed like a valiant thing you knew|user:[noise] huh|agent:uh i mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war	yeah	1
user:and that tradition is still i mean it's dying now but it's still alive|agent:yeah|agent:yeah	as opposed to	1
user:uh|agent:um-hum|user:and and so i- i i like the weekly magazines uh because i[t]- it uh gives me you know the high points of what's going on	but many times uh you know the the local uh local news kind of suffers you know	0
user:uh you know i don't really feel as though i've gotten a sufficient uh|user:and for for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events but generally they're they're they're more sound {bitish} you know kind of thing and and i don't really|agent:um-hum	you know dose of news that way	1
agent:oh i never saw that that would have been interesting|user:and and occasionally C-SPAN i- i like i- i saw the uh the uh the the tapes that were that were run of Marion Berry's drug bust was you know the whole thing was was run on that|agent:um-hum	and	0
EMPTY	[noise]	1
user:that again that uh|agent:yeah|agent:oh sure	you know AIDS is is something that has to be dealt with by every person	0
agent:but that's not to down play the importance of AIDS research you know|user:sure|agent:in in se[lected]- in selected spots and that's really becoming a really big problem	right right	1
agent:uh and died from it she|agent:actually that kind of hits home because that Kimberly Begajah that had AIDS|agent:and	right	1
agent:figured out how she could've gotten it from him|agent:yeah because_1 they really the last article i read on that they still hadn't|user:yeah i guess so	um-hum	1
agent:right|user:once they get them they're entitled to them for life and they can kind of take it easy because they're protected by their unions etcetera|user:[noise] well i- i think what's happened is a lot of these state and city jobs people feel that	uh during my college years my mom worked for the state and she got me a summer job	0
agent:right|agent:[noise] yeah|user:so in order to finish all the uh requisites they have to just stay longer until they can finally get a hold of the class	that th[is]- this i thought was totally outrageous that they have teaching assistants well that's that's an old thing you know having graduate students teach undergrads	0
user:and and and and my my wife you know you know looks at all those|user:[laughter] and and|agent:[laughter]	bills that come in	0
agent:and my intent was that whenever something went on sale that i really had to have i would have the cash to buy it right then and there|agent:now meanwhile i got had a building bank balance|user:hm	um-hum	1
agent:uh-huh and that's the way i do my credit cards now|user:have zero uh interest being paid and we pay it off as as it goes|user:but we also	yeah so we never really get that much over uh over extended	1
agent:[laughter]|user:the the the terrible part about it i've looked at it all and it all looks still pretty good to me why [laughter-why] do we need to replace it but|user:yeah it's uh it's about time that we did that but	but [laughter-un[fortunately]-] but unfortunately my my my wife Leigh feels as though it's it's just been an inappropriate uh	0
user:have had uh|user:we we just sort of|user:i don't spend that much money i just uh	you know too many obligations to you know we sort of take care of the kids when they were in school and they they got through school and	0
agent:yeah|user:[laughter]|agent:in a lot of ways	how so	1
agent:unbelievable|user:you know trying to kill others kids and|user:kids are bringing in guns into the grade schools and high schools and stuff [vocalized-noise]	you know	0
agent:yeah|user:i don't think there was much of a problem until crack started hitting the streets really|user:but i don't know you know it	yeah because_1 that's cheap and incredibly addictive	0
user:yeah yeah|agent:i do have a lot a lot help with those com[puters]- you know the curves giving a lot of information diagnostic|agent:but uh	but doesn't uh help the home mechanic that much unless they've got a uh you	0
agent:fulfilling the role it used to|agent:family isn't|agent:i think it comes back to the you know that the	yeah i-	0
user:you know|agent:[vocalized-noise]|user:they're they're out for the the quick buck mentality	who they gets defined by what kind of tennis shoes they wear	0
user:a left wing regime|user:how we treat them countries down there for example|user:over um	or communist regime is God awful and uh	0
agent:right wing regimes um|agent:i[f]- if they were coming from um|agent:am i saying this correctly or if	you wouldn't want them_1 in	0
agent:what was the whole thing with Panama i mean here we were|agent:right|user:uh our drug problem for us here's some money go shoot people with it you know [laughter]	[vocalized-noise]	1
user:wants to get involved down there|agent:truly|user:and and i just think you know we have this kind of short term we are not interested in developing the region unless there's big business involved and	we we tend to treat them as sort of like a backyard and you know i'm just [vocalized-noise] just like Mexico	1
user:you know i suppose you you say to yourself what will no rational uh person would would would launch uh nuclear weapons um but i guess that that's|user:yeah|agent:but perhaps not at this second	wouldn't necessarily hold uh for some radical government or temporary take over even	1
agent:and uh i think that's where they are headed|agent:they could become another Korea or Malaysia or Thailand type of [vocalized-noise] source for cheap labor where American products could be built|agent:and uh y[ou]- you know then we will have an i'd say thirty years if things stay the way things are now	right	0
user:you know they're not sure who they want their leaders to be they're not sure how they want the|user:we're we're still going through a a uh you know a settling period|agent:i don't thi[nk]- i don't think	you know uh relationships between the states to to shape so i agree with you know they're they need another couple years to to let them uh settle down	0
user:it's pretty casual uh|user:uh it's|agent:how about_1 you	i usually uh	1
user:you don't really want to be|user:but some of it's a little bit dirty you know you got all this machinery and stuff so|agent:yeah	wearing your	1
user:yeah|user:[laughter]|agent:not a topic you can get into very deep is it [laughter]	so let's see wh[ere]- where did you you said you're in Houston	1
agent:[laughter]|agent:thing out in LA|agent:what'd you think about that	which thing [laughter]	0
user:you think he was uh|user:and what do you think about it|agent:yeah	you think it was a good	1
user:you know a small part of the|user:only saw|user:yeah must've been i guess	the story	1
user:but but but th[e]- when i really am uh am concerned about is that uh so many of these|agent:[laughter]|user:the extent of it	child care places are are coming under uh	0
user:and uh that's a terrible kind of thing and i- i don't think my children have ever been subject to that but my wife didn't work and so|agent:uh-huh|user:well that's somebody to molest you know	we di[dn't]- really didn't have that much exposure to it	1
user:[laughter-oh]|agent:it was incredible actually [laughter]|agent:yeah	[laughter-oh]	1
agent:i think they have captured a certain market again bu[t]- but then there are babysitting groups as a pediatrician one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections as you start putting lots of little kids together|agent:experiences and i think|agent:well you know but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children i mean it has been a real um th[ere]- there have been some good [laughter-entrepreneurial] type	um-hum	1
agent:six twenty eight and twenty nine|agent:eighteen year old son the rest of my girls are like twenty three twenty|agent:i have uh five children i have a	um-hum	1
agent:her mother stays home and she they live wi[th]- that they live with us you know as in Orange County is really expensive|agent:um i have a seven month old granddaughter and uh|agent:and and then i have my um	um-hum	1
agent:same thing same thing that the her kids had right|user:you got sick yeah|agent:uh you know her children were sick all the time so when my son stayed over there he got sick	right well	1
agent:well what's happening in New York [laughter] well that's what we're doing too on our our current events and it's all over the|user:[noise]|agent:[noise] okay	[laughter-oh] what's happening in New York we're all reading about Los [laughter-Angeles] i think	1
user:uh you know the cover photo is|agent:uh-huh|user:we hear the news in a slanted fashion by how it's reported to us i was looking at this morning's paper and you see	a truck and and in the background everything's in flames	0
agent:um-hum|user:you know if you just hear the headlines you don't know that there were three other people in the car|user:we[ll]- well something i read in the paper was	that was stopped who got out put their hands up and said okay we give up	1
user:[noise] [vocalized-noise]|agent:[noise] okay well um i'll let you start i guess	well uh [noise]	0
agent:you know he crashed and [noise] killed some people because_1 he was uh smoking some marijuana and [noise] i guess air traffic controllers i wouldn't want them to be [vocalized-noise] [laughter-on] [laughter-drugs]|user:yeah|agent:[noise] uh train engineers because it you know uh like there was an incident several years ago where an Amtrak engineer would	right	1
user:because they're a uh|user:[noise] it's it seems to me that it's still should i o[ur]- our company's doing it|user:it's not a government it's not the Constitution doesn't apply but it	government contractor	0
user:uh|user:we don't we don't have enough courage to|user:uh first off	pick out the people that that have some sort of indication of possible drug usage	0
user:uh you know i i sit at a terminal and and write software all day it it|user:and|user:um	uh	1
user:that that i that i will give credit to to our our company for in that|user:yeah i|agent:several percent [noise]	that	0
agent:is that done o[r]-|user:spectrography or wh[at]- whatever it's called they|user:uh	chromato[graphy]- chromatography	0
agent:[noise]	[noise] i know	0
agent:yeah|user:with these kinds of mail order places|user:i it it seems like every time i turn around i have to write one of my world famous complaint letters to try and resolve these situations	uh but you know generally speaking i think products in most cases have gotten better than they were in the in the past	1
user:die very quickly|user:that that really irks me and i you know i'm not use to that and with technology you know i've had some answering machines here|agent:yeah	yet other brand names you know Panasonic and that that little that i can drop on the floor and they still work	0
agent:right|user:these brand names that we know|user:the the	and then you're you're if you're not informed as a consumer you end up with absolute junk	1
agent:you know where you want to extend your warranty of course i'm i know other places do this too|user:oh yes|agent:whenever you go there they try to sell you the insurance you know	[noise]	1
agent:and whatever you have to put in there to get the Shee[trock]- to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that i didn't we didn't know a thing about any of that and|agent:wall work and that's it because_1 you have you know get those joints to go together and|agent:put all the interior walls up we just didn't do any of the Sheetrock	yeah	1
agent:uh-huh it's on about uh|user:on the piers|agent:uh it's off the ground	did	1
user:i've|user:yeah|agent:you know i don't know i like them_1 you just sit out on the on the deck and do whatever have a barbecue or	i built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and uh	0
agent:yeah that's a pretty that's a good size deck|user:it's pretty s[o]- it was about four or five hundred square feet the same size as the addition that i just put on so|user:foundation work but uh	[noise] yeah	0
user:most|agent:[laughter] yeah that that it probably does i i don['t]- not sure but|user:well yeah it probably comes from where you are	[noise]	0
user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	uh with regard to uh to jury trials i you know i- i really feel as though uh jury trials are are uh whatever system has been been used historically in	0
user:you know Rodney got beat up because he|agent:no|user:and they didn't get beat up	he you know	0
user:well e[verybody's]- everybody's saying this is gonna be a new era we're gonna reexamine this thing|agent:we all saw the same thing on the on the tape and um|agent:black or uh don't live there or whatever	hey the bu[nch]- the average person is gonna take a look at that and say	0
agent:the bigger cities probably than we are in Idaho here|agent:and a little closer to the|agent:i was just wondering since you were you're in you're back east um	right i'm inside the beltway	1
user:and so|agent:oh i see|user:and so this is my seventh call a year ago i did eleven calls	that's that's why uh	1
agent:i think that we could probably save a little better or afford to do more things for fun that we'd like to do if i did follow a [noise] you know pencil and paper budget but|agent:and so you kind of have to you know i ha[ve]- in in my mind i know the basics i know what we've got to meet each month you know and and my salary helps towards that because mine's set you know but um|agent:but there's months that he brings home uh you know three times that much and there's some months he doesn't bring home anything it just depends on where the commissions fall	do you folks get to save	1
agent:uh-huh|user:from the cable TV industry|user:and it's a very pro consumer type of legislation but we're constantly running into trouble trying to get it passed because we're up against huge pack money donations	in this country and i've come to learn that a lot of these politicians unless you can mobilize enough consumers	0
agent:he thought that because he was president he could drive through whatever he chose|agent:and he wouldn't compromise with people|agent:but he had his own agenda	um-hum	1
user:because_1 we had a Republican Senator uh John Danforth who is strongly in support of it but then you had the|user:not doing the appropriate thing that that came down with the cable issue|agent:uh-huh	White House strongly against it	0
user:so i guess if we were to go about making the change|user:the metric system and i think the reason it failed last time is that most people really just didn't see any real benefit in changing|user:i kind of feel that there are more important issues to be dealt with than worrying about	you would have to really demonstrate to people that there is some legitimate reason	0
agent:right|user:uh even though they try to get you to use the Celsius system it it went a little easier because Canada is so influenced by Britain|agent:um-hum	and a lot of the products and services that they were either dealing with or receiving on their end were really equipped for	0
agent:uh i- i think i've heard that in Canada what they did was primarily they didn't change the size the sizes that various products came in they just changed the way they were annotated|user:um-hum|agent:English or British Imperial System whatever it's called units uh and the metric system units so this just says seven ounces	yeah	1
agent:i feel decidedly un[easy]- uneasy about it|agent:uh they could be paroled and go right back to doing what they did before i|agent:but uh when i know that	huh [noise]	1
agent:yes|user:running somebody over by accident|agent:by accident	that kind of thing	1
agent:or|user:that this person actually murdered someone|agent:um-hum	but i- i think the reason we don't go for it is because	0
agent:oh [laughter-yes] it's just that they're harder to hide|user:um-hum well they can do just as much damage|agent:rifles shotguns those sorts of guns are legal	[laughter]	1
user:well i'm|agent:so how do you feel|user:right	a little bit ambivalent the problem with uh	1
user:um|user:[noise] i mean right now|user:uh issues of uh race and things like that	i believe there are two policies that uh	1
user:at the bottom end|user:and so they can almost always find room for someone like that|user:they'd like to be able to get the top people in any field	they um	0
user:[noise]|user:uh letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico|user:and then the third thing [noise] is uh the political aspect of uh	they cannot close off the Mexican border not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would be uh	0
user:group to find jobs and uh|user:um|user:i think they're very difficult group to integrate into uh society they're very difficult	and uh places for	1
user:yeah well i know about it uh i mean it's it is|agent:have you been to have you been to Southern Florida|user:politically and economically	now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans uh twenty years ago	1
agent:we send a lot of money to Mexico|user:um-hum|agent:i'm sorry this i really feel strongly about this	um-hum	1
user:i don't know i don't consider the Soviet Union a threat in that uh|agent:huh-uh|user:you know the height of the Cold War and and whatnot but i	by any means just because of the fact that there's not uh uh	1
agent:uh now you know they never really have had democracy there in any sense so|user:[laughter]|agent:no they really didn't	no	1
user:despite the fact that they do have uh [vocalized-noise] you know probably a large uh substantial|user:maybe for the maybe for the simple reason that um|user:i'm not so concerned about an organized danger uh	nuclear	0
agent:as well as in Russia|user:right right|agent:in uh Kazakhstan probably in Ukraine	right	1
agent:if they can follow his lead in the other republics or whatever they want to call themselves now|agent:think if uh Yeltsin has a chance and|agent:um	yeah	1
user:um-hum|agent:most places as i understand it|user:right	do you worry that we might uh overs[tep]- [vocalized-noise] i guess my question is do you do you think that	0
user:but my husband does and um|agent:[laughter] [laughter-right]|user:i really don't receive any benefits right now [laughter] [laughter]	i think one of the um	0
agent:you know what kind of health care they have and does the company pay for it you know all or partially or how does that work|agent:you know|agent:and that's one of the big things that we always look at you know when we when i think about tak[ing]- changing jobs is	um-hum	1
agent:um|user:yeah|agent:pay for what you can wind up losing you know with a major illness or something	right	0
agent:and she works um as a assistant manager in a fabric store|user:um-hum|agent:because_1 that makes a big difference my wife works part time	uh-huh	1
agent:yeah|user:worked out really well for us too|user:as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do with that's	um	1
agent:[noise]|user:[noise] uh around here	we have a program where uh we	0
agent:uh|user:my you've got a lot a lot of nothing out there|agent:um very hard to come by	you know they got i mean there there's got to be a crevice between two mountains that	0
user:well that certainly uh you know uh getting into the swim of things|agent:[laughter]|user:hum	i- i think it should be i[t]- it should go to the to the heart of the matter though and say	0
user:[noise]|agent:[noise]	it looks like um	1
user:what i see behind it this this this uh|user:i guess the|agent:a little young for that one	maybe it's always true of third party movements but this one seems to be almost entirely negative	1
user:since most people agree on what needs to be done but nobody can figure out how to do it he's just going to say uh|user:[noise] and|agent:yeah	i'm a CEO i know how to tell people to do things and get them_1 done	1
user:ten or fifteen years where|user:it's it's a reaction to what's what's happened over the last|user:well i think um	um	0
agent:yeah|user:where things should go|user:vision of	and now things are are so stalled	1
user:i don't know those of us who weren't too happy with the Reagan years saw that as a|user:uh|user:[noise] the um	as just a um	0
agent:[vocalized-noise] know some some somebody got to look down the road a ways and say well what's going to go on|user:what|agent:ocean it's	yeah	0
agent:i i have kind of a|agent:and so you know|user:[noise]	[noise]	1
user:and where your actions could affect somebody's life i'd be much more accepting of drug testing but|agent:yeah|user:uh on drugs and things	under no circumstances would i think that you could just go take a job and they could say hey guess what you know we're [laughter-gonna] do this	0
user:and part of the um you know you take this test i did very well and they called me in for a physical|user:uh my mom had worked for the state and she thought this was a brilliant idea so i just went along with it i thought it'd be neat you know like a James Bond woman with a gun and all this|agent:uh-huh	and part of it was a test for drugs nobody asked me you know they didn't mention what they were doing but it was perfectly obvious and i you know all government people and all army people are just tested	0
agent:[noise]	[noise] why don't you start this time	1
agent:oh wow|agent:[laughter]|user:uh i'm the i'm the net coordinator up here for western and central New York	uh part of Net 260 here it's got we have eighty nodes in this city alone	1
agent:um-hum|user:well i see the phone companies are working on getting into information services so we're going to have a glut of things everyone i think we're going to see another revolution in|agent:you know it's going to kind of impact everybody everywhere	computers but i think the reason why it didn't work the first time is that they assumed that everybody would need a computer	0
agent:[laughter]|user:fighting like mad to have these suckers re-regulated you know|user:well they're working on that i'm a satellite dish owner and we've been	[laughter-because] of the uh because they've stomped on us	0
user:oh really|agent:certainly i[t]- i wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down [laughter-all] [laughter-the] [laughter-time] [laughter] [laughter-yeah]|agent:it's	what's the how old is your car	1
agent:the uh yeah that's a pretty good price and they're they're|user:well that's not too bad|agent:and you know a bit more if you add some some options and so on but [noise]	yeah	1
agent:yeah i can understand well would you want if you had to decide what would you want|agent:[noise]|user:but i never drove it so it just it wasn't me you know	and then	1
user:and uh it's so it's really amazing how much a minivan|agent:um-hum|agent:um-hum	c[an]- c[an]- you know what it can do	1
agent:yeah Minivans d[o]- do pretty well|agent:yeah|user:that was the only time we really needed it other than that it got terrible mileage and	yeah	1
agent:they have uh around here they've got these uh they're like uh condos|user:you know these|user:put me in a home because it's it's hellish on the person who has to give the care to a person like that	um-hum	1
agent:yeah that's a definitely uh that's statistically true|agent:up|user:well i- i think nowadays people are making that effort to eat right and to be more fit and i think old age is getting older	hum	0
agent:yeah|agent:i think it does come and go to some extent but it just keeps continually getting worse|agent:[vocalized-noise] i don't know	um that doesn't doesn't sound too pleasant	1
agent:yeah|user:i was brought up in in a city where everybody lived in apartment buildings and there wasn't any room to you know wasn't houses [vocalized-noise] there wasn't a room to take in the elderly|agent:um-hum	so if and when they couldn't take care of themselves they couldn't move in with you because_1 you had a three room apartment or something	0
agent:that uh seems to be why he's so popular i guess|agent:in either party|agent:it is it's just that fact that he's not	[noise] what's your view on	1
agent:right|user:the whole the whole shebang about throw the bums out|user:uh voter apathy and and	it and i[t]- it usually you know it's a big deal until	0
user:for me that's not a going to be a wonderful|agent:right|agent:exac[tly]-	uh feeling	1
agent:it's i like the idea|user:uh-huh|agent:that we could avoid winding up a slave state	and in what way are you talking about	1
user:that's true|agent:[laughter] as an extreme example right|user:yeah	yeah [laughter]	1
agent:uh oh eighteen the draft age|user:uh what age group i[s]- are are they looking at|agent:[laughter-yeah] well it's somewhere between here and there	eighteen	0
agent:[laughter-you] [laughter-know] we only find out about that a year after the fact|user:right|user:that's kind of scary	yeah	1
agent:i mean in the Democratic primary i'm gonna vote for Brown just because_1 i kind of like Brown and his attitude but when uh when it really comes down in the fall i think i know where it's gonna go|user:yeah i- i|agent:they uh i- i have high hopes for him and i think that you [laughter-know] if he could get people interested and encouraged and to believe that the government was actually for us then i'm for him	yeah	0
agent:hm|agent:[noise]|user:[noise] well my exercise program consists of uh you know it's it's a it's an opportunity to stay alive really	instead of w[asting]- you know wasting my my [vocalized-noise] you know the the trying to exist on the latency of my youth an[d]- th[e]- good health of my youth and i[t]- what i like to do is i like to stretch out	0
user:it's the uh you know the the amount of effort that's required|user:and uh and you know i kind of think it's uh it's a lot of work but i think it's uh|user:and and and i- i think that you know i've had a regimen now for about you know ten fifteen years of of doing that	to uh to stay healthy you know i have a sedentary job and uh	0
user:and so i- i got a real problem in that regard|agent:yeah|user:and i- i- i really feel i can i can dedicate about an hour an hour and fifteen minutes f[or]- to this effort but if it gets longer than that i- i it it i start not doing anything	uh	0
