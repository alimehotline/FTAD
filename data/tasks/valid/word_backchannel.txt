Arch how are you doing tonight oh that yeah fine kind of tired where am i calling where are you Lewisville okay i'm in Garland um have you read anything about how they propose to uh come up with the taxes to increase the funding for schools what do you think about it equalization of funding uh-huh um-hum but we're not funding them_1 like other states either though you know it we're not funding our schools like other states either that's right but just because we've got a lot of money doesn't mean that's gonna solve the problem i mean i think there's a lot of waste in in schools i'm a teacher that yes i f[eel]- i definitely feel that way all this money that's being paid for administrators hum-um i can well they're already talking about freedom of choice you know for schools that's an idea that's true but like in Garland you can choose the school that you're going to can you tell this is past bedtime um like in Garland they get to choose the schools that they're gonna go to but they got to have the transportation to them_1 if it's out of their district you know out of their area i mean so and i like that because_1 you can find out the good schools in your area so just distribute it equally and not raise taxes yeah what do you do oh so you picked a good field then you picked a good field well yeah but that's not a bad one yeah what do you think about a state income tax but didn't they pass that thing that we were gonna have a lottery or not oh so what about your income tax think they're hitting you too hard no huh-uh which just keeps accumulating i don't know what else do you think about them_1 let's see the state and the city tax the sale tax they used to you really didn't even think anything about it when you bought something but now you do it figures in what is it seven point i don't even know how they figure it really i'm glad i don't work in a store because_1 i wouldn't want to have to figure this seven point something percent i guess they've got a little table though and it's all written out so it wouldn't be so bad all right so you think federal tax is okay state tax you can see the logic of it but you don't think it would be economically feasible for your family and ours see both of us are teachers and we got four in our family too we don't need anymore but we can do this tax sheltered annuity that's the only thing that's saving us par[t]- lots and lots of people before they get it but still i work in southeast Dallas and a lot of my children are from poor you know socioeconomic areas homes and it's just like they always have money they they always are dressed nice you know most of them_1 are fairly nice not like you would think a a poor person would be and i mean they've always got dessert money or they've always got you know dollars on them_1 and everything and i'm thinking you know this isn't right because_1 my children don't have that yeah and you give them_1 you know they get their free lunch and they throw most of it away but then they have their money to go buy dessert and that they eat you know it's just you see garbage pans i mean pails just filled and we pay people to haul them off right and the like a guy does it and he has his own pigs that he yeah it is oh well is that you got anything else to say i don't think i do okay well ta[lk]- talk to you later then bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
have you ever got one of those calls that's either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and they're either offering a service or they're introducing some new product in the area and normally when they call you're either in the shower or you in the middle of cooking something and you had to stop everything to run to the phone that was the big one i'm talking about i work weird hours and invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall and you're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the cli[ck]- as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on or you hear somebody already starting r[eading]- reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already even had some of them_1 the they're voice activated and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything what i would love to see done to stop all of this we've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them_1 that's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences i put a stop to some of them_1 as far as the door-to-door either religious groups or people peddling products if i wanted their products i would've either gone to the store to bought it or i would've called for their s[alesman]- salesman to come out now i agree with their right to um pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment i'm on my turf if i want them there i'll call for them_1 otherwise i don't want to know they exist now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting i've even gone so far as to put that i've got a storm door on the front of the house and i've put in i don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting i should have g[uessed]- i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because_1 i still get wonder if there'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it'd be harassment but i consider invasion of my privacy a harassment in itself i believe we've pretty much summed everything up i'm drawing the blank uh pretty close to it well i've enjoyed talking with you and take it easy now good night	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

hi Diana have y'all been able to do much as a family these days have y'all been able to do much as a as a full family these days all of you yeah do you work outside the home yeah i don't either it makes a little bit easier i think that way yeah so you have a break too uh-huh uh we have family that's far away it sounds like you might too yeah right and phone calls that's about_1 it that's wha[t]- yeah that's what we mostly do pretty simple things especially since my youngest one is excuse me only fourteen months she she's really getting to the age where she's playing and likes to go places that that's right oh that's a big thrill for them yeah yeah that's true have um have you ever been to the Science no it's called the Science Place we ju[st]- we haven't lived here too long we went there couple weeks ago and uh oh yeah we i guess there's Science Place One and Science Place Two we've only been in i think it's Science Place Two the one we went in had um the thing that sticks out most in my mind is a like a kids place area that really see[med]- i mean they really seemed to go wild in there where's that uh-huh uh-huh oh yeah oh that does sound like fun it's a little bit of a ways oh that's right uh-huh that sounds fun too and and you said a[bout]- about Plano and Campbell is the petting that sounds fun i think maybe we'll try to do that uh-huh yeah because they can just do you don't have to have tokens for everything yeah that does sound like fun well i've gotten some good ideas from you definitely well i think i don't know if we've done five minutes but i'm sure that'll be be good was it good talking to you i had a g[ood]- i really appreciate your suggestions okay b[ye]- bye	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
um-hum well yes of course we do have capital punishment and we've you know done away with our quote fair share number yes yes it's certain crimes uh capital crimes murder of course uh rape this sort of thing and it seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks you know get into the system um-hum yes th[at]- that happens on occasion it sure does maybe it just depends on you know how closely the crime you know has affected you personally you know i don't know or a person personally i think i would be you know i guess really if i had to say yes or no i guess i would say you know that i am in certain cases in favor of the death penalty i don't know that it's a big deterrent really i don't know that it is i don't know how we'd ever find out you know really whether it is or not oh yeah oh absolutely yeah it goes on for years and years and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars taxpayer money yeah yes yes um-hum yeah it is it's it's a tough tough question it really is i suspect i would be uh you know a lot more favor of it if you know one of my children were you know brutally killed or something like that like i say i think it depends on how personally affected you know you might be by it oh absolutely th[at's]- that's right not with me personally it is with a lot of people it's not not to me personally no no um-hum yes that's a it's a tough tough question it really is yes i think most states do have capital punishment yes but i think the US is one of the few countries that still do yes they're only i was reading something about it the o[ther]- day i i wanna think there's only like six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still a lot of them_1 had to have el[ected]- elected not to do so now i don't know what they do in place of it you know maybe it's life imprisonment or you know something i don't i don't know how they handle it bu[t]- i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment oh yeah yes a lot of them_1 do get their sentences commuted to something else yes uh-huh yes right the first appeal is automatic so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat there's there's a lot of you know last minute uh things that happen cause a person not to have to go through the whole thing yes uh-huh that's that's fairly recent i don't know how recent but fairly recent in the state of Texas before that it was uh death by electrocution yes it certainly does yes it would almost have to be i suppose if you if you had to chose i guess i i am sure i would take the lethal injection yes absolutely it's a it's a tough question it really is i guess if i had to say you know yes or no i would say you know yes i- i would have to lean toward capital punishment you know for certain crimes no i don't think it's a monetary thing i think we hope that it will be you know some sort of deterrent or you know an eye for an eye type thing or something like that some of the crimes are just so brutal and so you know useless this may s[eem]- seem to be the best way out i don't know easiest way out maybe no i don't think it's a monetary thing yes especially the murder rate its just gone crazy yes absolutely yes i wish i had the answer for that everybody does yes it's nothing to be proud of certainly not yes so have we been very very fortunate that's right absolutely um-hum absolutely uh-huh that's right yeah so would i- i fortunately never been in that circumstance i hope i never am like like everybody else um-hum uh-huh right uh-huh sure it's it's a big responsibility it really is yes so would i yes absolutely it is it's a tough subject it really is right that's right well thank you it's nice talking to you uh-huh bye bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay i don't know which end do we push but okay right yeah that's true you know a lot of people uh uh i think the that it ends up the people that uh vote every time uh elections come around are more the the uh the party type followers the guys that uh you know follow the party lines you know and they you know just go in and if they're Republican they vo[te]- R[epublican]- vote Republican every year you know and uh the people that are independent you know are the ones that don't uh don't really uh show up every year because_1 they can't seem to to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate yeah yeah i always thought it was back when Anderson was running i was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes but that didn't work um-hum yeah yeah that's uh and and then people always get upset about it too because_1 you know every year the the the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote they they each think that uh if more people vote they'll get more votes i'm always amazed at that that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him you know yeah well that uh that's so[mething]- i i know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because_1 we live in a pr[edominately]- pr[edominately]- predominately Catholic type area and when things start uh when when abortion comes on the issues then people just get all inspir[ational]- inspired you know and uh still on the other hand we're also uh this particular community is a Catholic community but uh uh down in DC where where things are a little bit different uh you know it's it's women's rights and the a[nd]- and that sort of movement and so it's uh quite the opposite so elections start getting very uh the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones but uh yeah i can understand why why some of the the rural areas the voter turnout isn't as much because_1 it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in DC are like controlling things for the the Midwest and uh it doesn't matter who they put in office they're going to fall subject to uh the pressure that lobbyists can put well right yeah yeah well i don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year i think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected uh uh-huh unfortunately that'll probably even drop lower the voters turn down even mo[re]- uh turnout even more because_1 more Democrats will think that they don't have a shot so they won't even bother turning out they'll just say oh well you know the Republicans have this election we'll see you in four years uh but yeah i hope some of the local well that's what they they keep saying that it seems like people with i[t]- with old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the at the booths they they say that these older voters that uh you know they they feel like the kids are running the the country so they they don't come ou[t]- turn out to vote and they're the ones that uh you know really know what's going on have the experience and -[ha]ve seen you know how politicians can you know screw up or whatever but i know my grandmother hasn't voted in years um-hum yeah wonder if they're going to take into account with this uh this computerized conversation that there's little children you know bouncing in your knee the whole time your talking no i can't hear them_1 oh yeah uh Washington DC um-hum oh okay well i figured with Texas Instruments they'd probably have a few uh on the line now and then no huh-uh uh basically they they went through engineering companies and uh we're communications i w[ork]- i work in a communications company yeah yeah we sort of different they called me at uh ten o'clock one night that was very strange i guess they were doing it Eastern Standard Time i was like well i don't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes so i yeah um-hum okay yeah okay well if you're ever in uh DC can look up Wayne Sherman you'll say oh yeah talked to that guy okay oh okay yeah so do we yeah right next to Dulles all right well i'll talk to you later bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

i guess i'm going to school while i'm uh working at TI so there's not a whole lot of time that i've got uh for hobbies seems like lately but one of one the things that i do when i've got some spare time is and i do some woodworking and that oh i guess ranges anywhere from uh carpentry work to uh uh some types of furniture and uh oh i don't know what you would call them_1 knickknacks i guess stuff you hang on the wall and to put a mirror on and i made some uh candle sconces that you hang on the there's something about working with wood that that i enjoy that i don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood but you know yeah because_1 it's it's out there you know i don't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when i track in saw dust and the wife gets kind of aggravated at that but then i get the opportunity to vacuum so i guess i get s[ome]- some of both uh what are some of your things you like to do yeah oh yeah yeah it's a good time for gardening i could do with a little less wind but i think the the temperature's been pretty good so far for working outside do you find you do most of your your uh crocheting or your knit work around Christmas time yeah well that's kind of what my wife says she enjoys doing it during the cold weather because_1 she's always got something to cover her l[egs]- her legs and feet with while she's working on it i know seems like she i think she made three this year one for uh my father-in-law and and then a couple of brothers and sisters so uh sh[e]- those things they take some time to make oh that's kind of like quilting i think the mile a minute well i'm not sure what she does i i first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because_1 she starts and goes all the way across you know back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of of afghan i guess that's your standard knitting isn't it yeah i know oh okay instead of call waiting or call anything else well i guess that that's one way to end a conversation yeah what uh have you started your garden yet um boy oh yeah always got to have those i think i had four uh jalapeno plants last year i think one of them_1 died but i i got s[o]- you know i put them_1 i chop them_1 up and put them_1 in jars and usually give them_1 away because_1 i do[n't]- there's no way that i can eat all those and nobody else in the family likes them_1 but always got to keep those planted well that's kind of the way i am um i planted uh zucchini last year uh i planted four hills of them_1 i think i had three or four s[eeds]- seeds in each one of them_1 and those things just flat took over um it wasn't -[un]til late i guess in the summer maybe it was because_1 it was too dry they finally started making zucchini and i'm not sure when a good time to plant those is if if they should be planted early or later it seems like all i got was i would think so um seems like these all they all went to uh to leaf and it wasn't until late in the summer they started making fruit so i don't know if i'm mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon you know but i don't i hadn't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is it may not be it may not be you think they are later in the year uh well that's true mostly okra that's grown around here is is later okra well that's about_1 uh go ahead well i was just going to say we it's a little over six or seven minutes so whenever you feel comfortable about concluding well i'm um that'd be fine well all right i guess we'll call this one quits and thanks for participating all right have a good time bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

uh Robert what do you uh think what substances do you think are the most uh likely causes of air pollution right do you um do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like ai[r]- acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from industrial um areas factories and so on i was going to say and and you so you understand smog um-hum wow my word and that was a few years ago i- i wonder if it's any better now because they uh California has such strict rules um about emissions and so on um i- i don't know if you h[eard]- uh heard about the uh recent legislation in um Colorado um against a power company uh that's actually on Indian land i believe but um it has uh been ruled against uh regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the Grand Canyon and um i[n]- particularly in the winter months so they it was uh a landmark case because it's unusual to um i can't think they they were talking about shutting it down or if it didn't comply and so on i don't know that the information is one of those wire services kind of new[s]- pieces of news you know and so it's hard i never did see the full so i don't know but they said that it that it really caused so much smog over uh the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the uh piloting uh you know the helicopter trips and that sort of thing which would be horrible because the there's nothing i mean that's such a spectacle it'd be a shame to ruin it uh what do you think individuals could do or society could do to alleviate this problem um-hum you think it's more we[ll]- more in society well i guess i kind of agree there i um on an individual basis there isn't a lot that we can do about a lot of things but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can uh force uh government uh that we elect to deal more seriously with it and i do think that we have a responsibility there i must admit i'm not always real politically active but i do think that um Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards and it's brought their the they uh really listen to the the uh lobbyist and uh the m[anufacturing]- car manufacturing companies have uh you know have really pushed saying all those re[strictions]- those restrictions too hard we can't we can't quite make that go and they don't and then we still live with air pollution um so i suspect that that's one thing that that as individuals we can do make our voices known perhaps to our legislators but um as a society i think we can do more and that's probably how we ought to do it uh individ[ually]- being individually responsible a[s]- as uh in order to be group responsible right um-hum i suspect that the pub[lic]- that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure uh come to bear on the companies that deal with it and probably the only way that can happen is for um governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't and uh i don't know how long that that'll take sure exactly yeah right right well it's just the same thing with the car um uh the gasoline now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline so that we don't um run into this kind of problems we've recently had and yet the government's not going to do that because people are too dependent and they don't wanna they don't want to pay for it so instead we spend billions of dollars going to war um you know f[or]- wha[t]- however i[t]- it might have had other causes certainly oil was a big factor um and i think that's probably going to happen with with such things as air pollution when we when we se[rious]- get serious about cleaning up our motors in our automobiles then uh then maybe you know we'll have a little bit of help um uh do you have any air pollution in your area oh no your talking about from from the uh the middle middle states that that have more factories and so on yeah we really don't have that either although i think i can tell a difference in i lived in this area for about twenty five years and i think i can tell a difference in the comfort level um particularly in the summer uh you know when it gets hot and you have the that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air um usually they say caused by exhaust it seems to me that i'm more uncomfortable and you know my eyes sting more and so on and so on so i suspect that it's it's an ever growing problem well i suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here it was nice talking to you so did i bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

uh the last movie that i saw i i don't go to that many so i'll just have to talk about the ones that i went to see but uh it was Awakenings with uh Robin Williams and uh Peter DeNiro have you seen it it is i just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro he is one of the best actors i've ever seen it's there's a point where the uh the show is about these uh catatonic type people that this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the the living more or less but it wears off and the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic you know uh it starts off with like a tic and then it gets to where he can't you know control his movements at all and it was just so realistic the way you know you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor though no it was very serious very ser[ious]- he's good he's he's talented boy he is i know me too but uh well what was that show um Gar[field]- uh Garf[ield]- i want to say Garfield but that wasn't yeah The World According to Garp he wasn't always funny in that show was he i did too that's why i was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part but yeah right well what have you seen oh i saw it yes the whole way where did you cry um-hum uh-huh yeah yeah i cried when the horse got and when the wolf oh they when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him and then he uh the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards you know and that horse has been such a pal to him when he was alone you can tell i'm an animal lover you can hear my dog yeah it was a beautiful story it really was um-hum um oh i thought it was awful and so graphic i mean i hadn't even imagined it you know i think we've all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo um i had a friend who had fixed some uh chili buffalo chili and about a week before went to see the movie of course they raise them_1 now you know to eat but feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili uh after seeing that no it oh yeah yeah really really and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you know you could follow this this beaten down path and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing i know yeah yeah it uh uh have you seen any of the behind the scenes uh of of that movie it was they tried to keep it you know as very close to real i mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes and uh they had to teach a wolf how to to howl uh-huh that's the part they had trouble finding was wolves yeah right they just don't howl that much anymore i could they c[ould]- bring them_1 in with my dogs and set a siren off and that's all they'd have to do well i think we've made it i don't know is it five or three not either me too well thank yeah you too bye bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
what would you do about this pressing problem oh so with the band what do you play my uh my husband played music he was involved in music all of his life and went to Notre Dame where he decided he was going to have a good time and never never went into the scholastic bands he went into uh bands on campus and he played music but i i just can't believe that he didn't can play in a Notre Dame band when he was good enough to do it he went the other route i think uh i think the advise i'd give to parents would be to start when they're like four years old today yeah at least start saving and and start routing them to where at least they'll have a chance to get ahead yeah that's it's um i wish i had known more when i was uh choosing a college i i kind of did or i'd i went off to i grew up in California and i went off to the University of Utah and didn't find the atmosphere there what i quite expected so i came back and went to Cal State and so i kind of do what you did only by route of another school and i wish i had known more about what a school meant oh right well it still is i was just looking at a job sheet that's about all that's in there do you think it do you think it's well worth going to uh uh bigger school or more well-known school right right the reputation that they have a good reputation um some of these i didn't the college i went to was a big school but i was an English major and it the English major is very small so i had the benefit of being able to talk to my professors and hangout with them you know and i really appreciated that right i think that's what i would tell parents hey i'm headed there well they have the master of liberal arts there and so i thought i would go and do that it's the closest thing to a humanities degree that they let you do at night it's not the i i'm not into the Bohemian thing you know were i waitress during at night and go to school during the day no i i agree but it's like oh you offer this degree okay i'll go i've always wanted a masters degree but to get one in in English or anything other than an MBA it's really difficult to do at night yeah right it's true and and just lived the easy life that's true oh it it would be wonderful i know the little dreams right right that's true yeah i i uh i picked up sweats for the track team i was track team manager we got i got to ride the bus all over the state i got to see everything so it was fun it was li[ttle]- i did that for a long time it was a lot of fun so i that yeah yeah that's true yeah that was a good thing to look out for well we're still writing checks for the loans for Notre Dame but he's really happy he went there wow right yeah yeah but we had fun uh i really i miss college i had a good time yeah it was fun well i'll just wrap this up now that we've done our conversation for tonight i i gue[ss]- i don't know what they're doing with the conversations aren't aren't they like put taking the words and and listening to the dialect and yeah that's funny that would be interesting well it was good talking to you okay thanks a lot bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
hello hello did i reach the Dallas area yeah that's what my name is Fernando hey how's it going do you work for TI North Carolina State University yep i'm getting a Master's in computer science and computer engineering um i took a voice IO course well uh one of my teachers went to a to this conference up in Bethesda Maryland and so he saw it there and he just said you guys want to make some money and talk five minutes a day here you go so uh not originally Argentina yeah uh well i used to live up in New York and Maryland and i uh i like i like bigger cities i like i like more populated areas because i used to live in Buenos Aires but they have ten million people but uh this area is nice it looks like it's got a lot of uh job opportunities especially at Research Triangle Park and so it looks it looks well it's the third largest growing area in the country for businesses yeah yeah no North Carolina State yeah no the Wolf Pack yeah no we're we're not we're not the Tar Heels wh[y]- why do you run oh okay my dad is too yeah yeah it's nice yeah it's it's clothing right how you how you dress to go to work and how it changes from season to season and from day to day okay okay ready i'm going to press the one no then then we say bye and uh i- i prob[ably]- well i i got a stopwatch here so i'll probably say you know it's like well we've been talking for five six minutes so okay well uh we'll just open it okay i'll press the one ready okay okay so well you see since i don't work i just go you know to class it all depends because_1 i like to wear like sweat pants because it's more comfortable for me but you know it's like when you're in school you either wear sweatpants or jeans yeah yeah yeah okay are they like T-shirts or are they like do they have oh okay well because how how hot i mean like like in the coldest that it gets in winter down there how much is it yeah yeah that's well it's basically you know it's like i got like a leather jacket or a you know so i just put on a T-shirt and a leather jacket and i usually stay in class that way and if not i would wear a sweatshirt underneath it and then you know you'd but what happens is uh what i've seen here on campus it's very strange because a lot of black people here they wear like dress pants and dress shirts to go everywhere okay and they wear either that or they wear dress pants and black turtlenecks or white turtlenecks and so the thing is you know is like i asked a guy you know why why do you wear that he goes well it costs me the same amount which is true because some dress pants you know cost me twenty five dollars which is the same as jeans but um but basically all over here everywhere everybody wears jeans and if not what the what the thing is that they're wearing now is sometimes you wear like shorts with biker pants underneath it which is yeah where at where at oh okay yeah yeah but the thing is when you started with TI was it as big as a company as it is now yeah yeah which is which is bas[ic]- i mean when hello you probably got wait calling okay well i guess i'm supposed to talk alone while he's on the wait call about clothing right so i don't know what to say i don't wear any we're at nudist camp we don't wear any clothes here yeah oh that's okay yeah was that in the seventies no no but uh when i[t]- it had gone up yeah yeah i re[member]- i- i qui[t]- i sort of remember that i'm only twenty two but in the seventies i heard you know TI was even making uh those little watches you know those those uh LED watches that you couldn't see in the sun yeah so yeah well they said that women like the the you know executive women or women that work whatever they spend uh five hundred dollars on clothes a year so but but for me yeah i mean women go all i mean what i've seen like you know they like to wear something different every day and for me it's like people know how i dress and w[e]- we have you know like the gym here they give you shirts right which which you use and then you take back they give you a clean one and so sometimes you wear you know the shirts from from the gym everyday of the week the only thing is that you can tell them apart because they have the year that they were bought in so i mean you don't feel as bad because it's like they they give you different year sometime you know so you're wearing you know sometimes you're wearing eighty nine the other times you're wearing ninety one the other times you're wearing you know eighty six so it's okay you right see when we take PE you have to dress in the in PE clothes but it i[s]- it's issued to any one that wants one that's in the university well right now since i'm graduating i'm o[nly]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

hello did i reach the Dallas area did i reach the Dallas area Dayton Ohio i'm from North Carolina in Raleigh yeah so my name is Fernando so um do you work how'd you find out about this oh okay he works for TI oh okay because i'm down at NC State and so i took a class and he said sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes so are you ready okay let's get started okay so uh what do you think uh that uh wh[at]- what wh[at]- what do you think we can do to solve the crime in America yeah but what what what are the steps well see the problem is is that um what happens is as that you're uh you know as you go from the country to a city crime always increases right because in the country people still respect uh the property of other people and so as as and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities and they wish to get the same thing they say why can't we have the same things that these other people have and the thing that we can do is we need money for drugs and what we have to do is we have to go there get some stuff steal it and then you know resell it which one yeah that's uh that's uh the main reason i think uh everywhere because uh you have deaths i mean i mean you have murders and you have you know people stealing other people's stuff and that's a lot of it has to do with drugs it doesn't have to do i mean the thing is is that you know it's like you might be standing somewhere right and like let's say you're you you go you know you're driving out and you're driving back home and it's late at night and you stop by one of these you know twenty four hour you know gas stations joints and uh somebody walks in there with a gun i mean they're going to want the money and you can tell by the people who are always caught that these people are there to get money for drugs i mean they don't want the money so uh so they can do something else with it right right and so um-hum okay yeah yeah there's a there's a a song that i know which says you know that it's like in uh nineteen eighty eight nineteen eighty nine the local state and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in America and uh i their figures i think are true so i mean it's like compared to you know compared to weapons and stuff like that i mean you're spending nothing on on crime in the country itself what you're doing is you you know it's like you have other things you know it's like you have the AIDS we're going to solve try to solve the AIDS problem while while you know some people are getting killed here and there and then uh-huh but those people never get caught the people that that that i see their theory is that if i'm surrounded and i'm going to be caught i'm going to try to pry my way through and they're not going to take me alive but i have such a big army outside of my place that nobody can touch me you know it's like of course i mean i might be you know the the leading drug dealer here but you won't find me dealing in drugs i mean there's no connection between me and the people that you caught you know right yeah yeah i was i was at a at a party on Saturday and this guy comes up he goes hey how you doing whatever and then he started talking to me and this guy was from Jamaica right and he's got his little brother selling drugs you know and he goes yeah i just came up here to work and i go oh you did i bet you make uh very good money up here he goes yeah i make a lot a lot of money he goes you know and uh in the movie Good Fellas did you see it okay in one part the guy goes out of jail and within uh two months he had all his house payments done everything paid and you know and he had enough money to you know it's like those guys at one point you know they had so much money that they didn't know what to do with it yeah yeah that's that that was also in the movie yeah so hello Mary we've been talking for five minutes it was all right okay same here bye-bye	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

uh-huh uh-huh yeah because they're just sort of coming from the side or whatever yeah uh-huh yeah plus uh you know look at the you know the besides the po[llution]- the the aspect of invasion of privacy there's a big pollution aspect too i find i throw out a lot of those flyers and i have no interest in whatever they are i- i do i find an[d]- and they go alone with that just the things you get in the mail i you know my my name being sold if i if i give money to the World Wil[d]- Wildlife Federation you know it's a it's a i feel it's an invasion of privacy to receive so many pieces of junk mail because they sell my address uh-huh yeah that's i agree yeah and it i'll call you and they all say that they're the best Visa but you know i definitely have the one that i've so far picked out to be the best you know because of a low interest rate or whatever you know very rarely do you receive one that has a real low interest rate they're always more expensive and they uh you know if you stay with a if you stay with a good one for the while you get a good credit rating and you get a good um a good credit line so you don't like to i don't like to bother with it yeah um uh-huh yeah huh um-hum that's right yeah that's right it takes uh uh-huh yeah they ask you a lot of they ask you a lot of personal questions and they yep and you know they and they just keep talking to you too i- i i find that a big pain yeah i think uh-huh yeah i think uh do you find that as a woman that you probably see more things of invasions of privacy than uh a man would yeah uh-huh huh uh-huh yeah yeah wh[at]- you know what's really funny is that um i get calls you know mostly telephone sales people that i just you know that want to start beating my ear you know and um and then they start asking you know well is your wife there and then i'm thinking well how did they know i was married you know and then i'll say i'll say no she's not because actually my wife and i live apart right now because i'm in graduate school and um so i only get to see her on Thursday through Monday and it's one of those things where they'll say oh your wife's not there and i'll say i'll say no oh well when is she going to be there and i'm like well she's never going to be here yes she's never going to be here so you know oh yeah uh-huh and and they'll keep going until they get that out of you when your wife is going to be here because they want us to be here together because i guess uh it's i[t's]- yeah maybe she would talk me in yeah maybe they'll yeah uh-huh yeah they they do what do you think i just just threw out stuff tonight that uh i walked out of a grocery store and a fellow said you know for a dollar you can win this five hundred dollars worth of groceries and normally when you see these things it's normally um uh a church you know that's doing a raffle or it's some type of boy scouts or it's some type of group or whatever and i automatically you just think oh it's a raffle must be for the kids you know so you pull out your dollar and you fill out this coupon and and then when you look at it as you walking away you see that it's for some sales pitch of some kind where they're going to you know and i find that a big invasion of privacy i just i'm from then on in it's like oh this makes me angry you know now you have to question everybody on what they're doing now you sure this goes to such and such organization and you sure you're with multiple dys[trophy]- you know muscular dystrophy or whatever i find that a big invasion of privacy too because they they sort of pull that over on you you know like um like this is a charitable organization but actually it's not it's a come on so that they can get your name and phone number so because you always put your phone number down so they can call and tell you that you won but actually they started calling me telling me that i could you know buy a soft water softener and they called me for um what else other than water softener the same place called me for something else in my kitchen it was all kitchen stuff they put me on and they all called me you know and each one asked me when my wife was going to be here uh-huh uh-huh well i think also you know in th[e]- the if men are home during the day they're they're um they might be unemployed men who might be more apt to um you know be at the end of their rope you know and be looking for uh uh a salvation in the sense or looking for a uh saving grace you know i looking for something yeah they're searching for something yeah and also and also you know the woman at home during the day if if the housewife is at home um uh you know she may be bored at the time so she'll spend a little bit more time to listen i think you know because she may have finished her work the kids may be taking a nap they may uh they may be playing some place you know or yeah um-hum he said what that's an invasion of privacy oh that's true that's true uh-huh what you know the the terrible thing is i don't know if you've watched the news lately i- i guess we just had something up here you're i'm in Baltimore Maryland so um i get you know we i saw some news out of like New Hampshire and a big thing in the courts right now is um they don't have enough stalls in women's bathrooms as they do men's bathrooms so that men you know because men design these things men can go in and use the urinal or use the toilet but their lines are always you know they go through much faster but but the women have to wait in long lines that are uncomfortable and and if they really have to go it's a very difficult problem to be you have to stand in line for an hour and uh and then the whole	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well the roles of women have certainly changed over the last uh decade or two and i wonder if the the stresses that it puts on the the woman's body is uh all that good for her as it were had had there been enough adjustments in society to help the woman cope with what she has to go through um support group wise or or just all the different aspects that men have developed over the years to handle what the world does to them uh how how is the woman's world coming along in that respect do you think a matter of choice or economics both uh-huh yeah that's true you know that's an interesting point that you brought up about the the fact that they essentially always have been under stress uh i would say more in the later latter years even those who stayed home had stress but when you're the one or the two out of ten women staying home on the block uh then the stresses that you do have uh the normal day-to-day stresses caring for children or whatever is occurring uh you could go to at one time one era you could go to the other dozens of wives on the block or you could meet for tea or whatever and you had that stress relief uh built in uh whereas now with it's a kind of fifty fifty split or leaning whatever percentage happens to be in your neighborhood like for our neighborhood we're looking at ninety percent working women let's say uh there's no place for the wife to go when she has uh those kind of of stresses to be relieved so that's right about two months ago Omni Magazine which is a a science magazine are you familiar with that read an article um really restating some conclusions of some some uh programs or some investigations or research whatever you want to call it into the the actual physical differences between men and women and questioning whether those physical differences uh accounted for some of the differences in ways women handled stress as opposed to men and i guess to just barely summarize what the article said was that in the the womb the differing levels of testosterone and estrogen across the lower part of the brain the base of the brain affected essentially how the brain was connected to the rest of the body uh now how that has to deal with stress i'm not really sure since i thought most of the stress had to do with you know from the from the eyes and the mental processes on up i don't know what it would have to do with the connectivity to the rest of the body but it was an interesting uh uh line of reasoning where we've always thought or been told especially by the for lack of a better term women's libber you know we're just the same as men well maybe not and and maybe you shouldn't be exposed to the stress the same way that men have have managed to do all these years and maybe it will take a lot longer before the phy[sical]- physical evolution or for lack of a better term will occur to allow you to handle what we've put ourselves through right right yeah the subject would die before they had to run all the tests that they need it would be an exhausted test uh how about the the area of role models or roles as it were when you you know teach the boy that uh he fixes the car and the woman fixes the meal uh not not arguing that there should be a role for a sex but should there be uh a set of not not a specific role let's say let's not say that only the the girls should do the cooking but at any given generation or for any given uh compatibility if you want a couple to be together shouldn't they have uh defined roles as it were uh certainly capable of sharing the other role for nothing more than empathy i mean it you know at least they understand what the other person is going through uh not being a tremendous cook i- i know what the burden of preparing a meal but i don't know what it would have taken to make that meal taste any better out on the budget i give her that kind of deal so i- i wonder i don't have any argument or any problem with women changing a given role as long as there's something on the other side let's say of of any relationship to to match that i mean you don't want two people doing the same thing in the relationship so uh-huh yeah i i- i know one that's st[ill]- that way but that's about it i'm down to one friend that holds that position still i'm the only one home right now and i i have the kids clamoring for my attention now so i understand what that's like now that's an interesting point yeah i mean once the expectations are	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well i'm not i'm not sure what what the people of Puerto Rico feel uh how do you feel about uh the possibility of Puerto Rico becoming a state yeah well i question whether it's in their best interests to become a state right now they are a commonwealth and that means that they are under US protection in the event of uh defending their their country uh they do not have any voting privileges though and i don't believe they have any representation in Congress yeah i don't believe they have to pay any uh like federal tax uh uh yeah i think they are they they do get uh priv[ileges]- privileges like that i'm not sure how much that uh carries on yeah well i think we've got uh like a language barrier too i think most of the people there speak only Spanish i'm not sure how fluent they are in English and that's one of the major problems i i see with uh other countries as such being uh say the possibility of becoming states that we don't have a common language with them right i think we'd have the same type of problem say with Mexico uh Canada on the other hand uh English is one of their national languages they have yeah uh-huh so i think they're yeah i just see a lot of uh social and cultural differences that could uh pose problems with uh Puerto Rico becoming a state um i don't think they're strong enough myself to become independent uh i think that it's in their best interest right now just uh to remain as is keep the status quo and uh keep uh stay under the U[nited]- United States protection yeah because i think that if they if they tried for independence they would probably have uh military factions that would oppose each other and and they would vie for leadership and uh the people who are well off there the middle upper class if there is such a thing uh they would probably be at a disadvantage losing possibility of losing their uh their assets or wealth uh i don't see it in the near future yeah well i've never been there i'm not quite familiar with with uh the way they do things uh-huh yeah oh i think that you know part of the biggest problem there is that they still really are third world country and they haven't uh caught up uh economically with uh say the United States uh-huh okay well did you have guides from the area or escorts or uh okay okay right yeah well they've got that Latin blood they get fired up about every little thing anyway i think one of the most interesting things about the possibility of uh attaining a fifty first state is what would we do about our flag how do you arrange fifty one stars what kind of pattern does do we come up with for that could have a contest well that would give them_1 them more of an interest in what goes on in this country if if they had uh uh a a uh a privilege of voting uh that would give them a vested interest in the government and uh i would see that as as a positive uh thing for them to consider probably uh yeah i really don't see any change in the near future well Cuba's closer but uh right that is a good distance what is their major industry is it uh i i believe is it sugar cane or i'm not su[re]- sure exactly what they do right okay yeah i'm not very familiar with with the the state of their a[griculture]- agriculture right you have to question have to wonder how much tillable land they have uh being an island uh-huh uh-huh right yeah i know they must have a lot of tourism too but i don't see as much advertising there as you do in the Baha[mas]- the say the Bahamas with uh say uh uh Saint Thomas uh Virgin Islands uh places like that right well the Virgin Islands are an American territory and but you see a lot of advertising for that uh as far as uh vacation uh cruises and re[tirement]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

so what kind of music do you like yeah that's same here do you yeah uh-huh yeah that's about that's about all i listen to is the classical stuff we have a we have a really good classical radio station here it's uh gets no money from the state or the feds or anybody it's uh one hundred percent listener supported and it's a twenty four hour station yeah they they get a lot of support here uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah that's the good thing about them they do no advertising that's it's really nice just music yeah i li[ke]- i like PBS uh PBS here you can't get it unless you have cable and that really upsets me because_1 i won't pay cable prices because_1 there's it's it's useless having cable i think it's uh it's far too expensive and they don't have anything on there yeah exactly i've almost given in a couple of times and gotten it every time i get one of those special offers in the mail but i've avoided the temptation so far but i sure do miss PBS because_1 they they have lots of good stuff Masterpiece Theatre and mystery and nature yeah yeah um-hum yeah i- i had cable before i uh came up here and i miss some of it i mean we had pretty good cable where i was but i miss Discovery Channel and A&E and CNN you know i'm having CNN withdrawal pains every once in a while um uh occasionally down in Charlotte yeah it it's it's pretty good um yeah um-hum yeah yeah i been into Boston a few times uh i was there last year during the Fourth of July thing and went out to the um Esplanade and listened to the Boston Pops and they're good they're really oh really yeah i Boston's okay i mean i wouldn't want to live there but it's a nice place to visit yeah it's crowded i know that it's murder driving in that place yeah and i always get stuck in the in the afternoon traffic um-hum well i tell you the way people are driving nowadays i'm surprised we're not killing more people than we are seems like drivers are getting worse and worse every year um human factors that's um well it's sort of difficult to explain it's it's industrial engineering and you look at applications and things from the h[uman]- from the human factor standpoint how does it interface with the person using it and and yeah it that's very similar yeah very similar um uh specializing in the computer and you know uh interfacing with computers and software and all that kind of good stuff yeah this is uh sort of the same sort of thing that's why it's it was the uh professor who brought this thing in he'd gone to a conference down there and brought this thing up i yeah sure i'll do it why not hey if TI wants to give me five bucks a phone call that's okay you have to talk to all kinds of neat people all over the place um-hum where's she at yeah there's yeah there's not too many not too many big ones around here uh matter fact we don't have any big ones after you know after being used to places like Boston and Atlanta you come here and you know they people think Charlotte is the big town and it's small yeah uh Charlotte oh what about quarter of a million oh it's fairly good size i mean it's it's not it's not small but it's certainly small by Atlanta standards course everything's small cons[ider]- compared to Atlanta yeah my my brother and uh sister-in-law live there i like yeah Atlanta's Atlanta's a good city it really is uh you have to get used to that cotton picking traffic on two eighty five but uh if you if you miss it at the right time of the day then you're okay but it always seemed like when i was there i was always finishing i lived in Duluth which is uh north of Atlanta well not north it's more east uh along I eighty five and i would always be on the other end of two eighty five having to go all the way around two eighty five and then onto eighty five to go home and it was always at the end of the day i never managed to plan my departure right oh yeah yeah yeah it's scary it's scary they they rival even uh Chicago on uh departure and arrival uh number of arrivals every day yeah oh it's a busy it's a busy place and they have amazingly few accidents there amazingly few because_1 uh i mean if you're flying anywhere down here you always go through Atlanta you can't avoid it it's the hub city and uh God um-hum yeah yeah that's super it's getting even better too yeah they they just they never stop doing things to it all kinds of good stuff go yeah last well see i left there in uh eighty what was it eighty six so it's been it's been five years for me yeah it just doesn't stop i mean it yeah yeah yeah sure yeah exactly couple of years ago i was thinking about moving to Massachusetts but uh boy i'm glad i didn't because it's really going downhill up there well you know i- i was when when the big boom was going on i was thinking well Dukakis must be an absolute genius and then i- i- i really think that all of that was just you know temporary growth and everything to make him look good for the Presidential election because it certainly wasn't sustained well yeah but on the other hand if it if it needed his personal intervention all the time then it wasn't a good system anyway you know it should it should have been rolling right along without him you know good a good chief executive would be able to sit back and not do anything hopefully no that's true and and and Lord knows with that legislature up there they probably did all kinds of things while he wasn't looking so well you can't you can't trust legislators anyway yeah we n[eed]- we didn't talk too much about music but we had a good conversation	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

have you been having any uh good weather lately oh i'm in Texas Plano uh-huh yes i do yeah it was pretty nice today but i stayed inside i came up with a cold couple days ago so i'm taking care of that but uh yeah it's nice and sunny out uh not lately but uh yeah there was a little bit of rain couple days ago and they had tornados up in uh Oklahoma and i guess in Wichita Falls too uh-huh no i'm from Wisconsin originally uh i don't know what the weather's been like up there but uh typically in March it's still uh kind uh kind of like winter uh very cold w[ell]- we had a real mild winter here though okay i can believe that uh-huh no i've well Wisconsin gets pretty bad sometimes too but uh probably not near as bad as New York uh i'm sure i think it depends on what part of the state but this winter here i think we only had one instance of ice one weekend and uh other than that uh it was uh maybe just uh three real cold spells i don't have too much uh shrubbery damage from that but uh still some didn't manage to survive yeah it gets it gets uh hot but uh it's not very humid and there's always a nice uh breeze blowing yeah you know i've been here about thirteen years and i've gotten qu[ite]- quite acclimated to the weather i the summers don't bother me anymore at all i don't mind when it gets over a hundred degrees yeah sure i don't know what kind of a summer we're expecting this year i imagine it's going to be hot again well that's pretty typical though uh i don't uh i don't guess it's going to be any much different uh than than it has been in the past so i expect uh July and August we'll see our or uh share of hundred degree days no i never have i've been close uh was in Detroit one time just right right across the river from Windsor yeah i believe that i was in Wisconsin over uh the Christmas holidays and it was about uh twenty below zero when i got up there they uh they had a high of i think eighteen degrees during the week that i was there so it's stayed cold for the entire week um we got one day of snow and one day of ice other than that it was pretty good just cold we don't get too much snow here well i can live without ice yeah the snow is nice doesn't usually last too long here yeah i remember maybe uh maybe three winters where we had a white Christmas here other than that it's uh the snow usually doesn't last more than a day or two we uh-huh yeah well that's not uncommon what's really bad here in winter is when we get uh ice on the roads and the temperature doesn't get above freezing there is no uh ice removal equipment yeah that is if if the businesses are all open uh lot of them close down that's right we didn't close at all this past winter yeah well we usually have to make them_1 up though so uh well i work at the main set in Dallas yeah uh-huh i well did uh did you get much rain two days ago much rain yeah Thursday i didn't get much rain here in Plano but i guess it really poured in Richardson yeah i don't think we got uh i don't think we got it near as bad as uh Oklahoma and i guess Fort Worth had high high winds in fact uh the wind was responsible for knocking down a light pole at the Water Gardens that killed two people so they usually get uh worse weather than we do in winter too yeah an[d]- we get a lot of tornados too this is the time of the year no i sure haven't it's i think it's supposed to be nice though seventies eighties i guess i've been checking on my plants seeing th[e]- the roses bud out already yeah somewhat uh have to kind of watch watch the weather make sure everything is going the way it's supposed to waiting for the wai[ting]- waiting for the weather to get nice out so i can go ahead and uh replace some of the some of the dead shrubs from winter but uh like i said i stayed in today because_1 i picked up a cold the other day so didn't feel like going outside and doing much uh-huh yeah we we really h[aven't]- didn't get enough rain the other day to uh do much good for uh things growing just a lot of weeds right now and they'll come up whether we get nice weather or not uh-huh well you've got a lot more control over the inside temperature than you d[o]- than you do outside okay yeah i don't do well with potted plants outside i tend to ne[glect]- neglect them and they sit in the sun too long and dry up or uh if i don't put them_1 in the sun they don't grow i don't know but uh yeah i guess next week's supposed to be real nice outside i hope it is anyway because uh softball season starts and we're ready t[o]- to go outside and do some outdoor activities okay well uh i haven't heard the forecast for the ne[xt]- for uh coming up for this weekend or next week so i'm not sure what to expect i can only guess that it's supposed to be nice uh-huh i'm not sure what the overnight low was yeah guess i'll have to turn on the weather on the news tonight see what we're supposed to expect anyway i guess everything's been pretty typical for March have to see what uh April or May have to offer sometimes it does uh sometimes it'll get in the eighties uh as early as uh January February well they still have snow on the ground through March and probably part of April sometimes well it leaves a mess then when it does melt everything thaws out lot of mu[d]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

okay pro football i like two teams one the New York Giants and the second is the Raiders that's right across the country i don't think i could i don't think i could i don't think i could spread my patriotism any more than well actually i like uh San Francisco 49ers too but uh yeah uh i'm surprised being that being from Dallas i thought you'd be a Dallas fan oh i see uh-huh i liked uh the Cowboys i lived in in West Texas in Abilene i worked with TI in Abilene for ten years and i really enjoyed watching the Cowboys play and they they went through a rebuilding thing down there and and and uh i watched them go downhill like all the teams do you know like Pittsburgh did like the New York Giants did like like i think the 49ers are about to do i think the the players get a little old and get a little tired and uh sure you're exactly right and and this the other teams failed to do Houston failed to do that they had Bum Phillips in there and a and a good running back i forget to uh i forget that fellow's name uh Campbell Earl Campbell and they run that man to death and yep but they had nothing to back it up and and uh you see that so much in pro sports we we go through this this rebuilding cycle without a without a backup bench and it's it's happened in basketball here with the Celtics and this year they finally gotten some backup support so you don't have to keep five guys out there for an hour you know but i like uh i like the Giants i- i kind of think they snuck into the championship this year this past year and and i'm not so sure they'll get away with it again but they they kind of pulled it off this year but i like yes yes i think the whole thing of how they got there was to me i- i kind of well i- i guess that's the rules and and the way the and the way the the play-offs are run but i i don't know i just think there was probably some other teams that they only missed by couple of points and they really should have been in there but i like the Giants because of uh Bill Parcells and i like him as a coach and he's he's been for years a a good coach i- i think i'm not sure that they can repeat okay yeah yeah no no i don't think they'll be able to carry it that far uh who who would you if you had your pick out of anyone of the league teams who would you say is going to be the new new uh Super Bowl champions this year for ninety one that kind of that kind of put you out on a limb a little bit i guess i thought i thought for sure that Buffalo was going to be in there this past year i really did and i w[ould]- that would be my choice that would be my choice again this year because with Kelly at quarterback when he went down hurt they brought another young fellow in there yeah Reicher or whate[ver]- Reicher whatever his name is and boy he they never even missed a beat i mean they just kept right on pouncing and if it weren't for the tumble of the ball Buffalo would have been there this year and and to me that's another super team course i'm being up here in the northeast corner i kind of like these northeast teams course i used to like the Patriots too they were just down the road from here but boy the Patriots are kind of sad they're now they're talking of moving out of town and they ought to all get out of town and take Kiam with them_1 but uh yeah they they really i think they hurt the sport this year with all that controversy over that locker room incident with uh with uh all that the reporter and stuff and i think they just could have handled it more professionally i- i- i believe that they they hurt themselves i guess they've had a lot of trouble with uh with the Sullivan boys and Kiam they didn't really see eye to eye and of course the the big political football up here you know now they're now they're trying to move the team somewhere else the last i heard boy just kind of i've been a Patriot fan for years and years and you know when you when they're only like thirty miles from where you live you can get to see the games once in a while and it's just a shame you keep going there and like week after week and every week you come away a loser i mean y[ou]- after a while guys get tired and we just didn't go anymore so yeah sure but they played like professionals exactly right yeah yeah they they really didn't do good at all for and that's that's too bad because they were they were some good play[ers]- they are some good players on the Patriots team you know and i think they need to get rid of Grogan he's been around too long they need to put him in the front office doing management or something but they need to get him off the field and and get the manager he is eventually because he's been he's been hurt so many times and he's not as agile these young fellows they just take advantage of that and and and though they don't show it and say it and do it intentionally it's just their strength will beat him you know sometimes sure of course no one does i'm sure they don't you know it was that that would be and the other thing is they're going to be there in that same position one of these days you know and hopefully they like Bo Jackson now as i understand has hurt himself in both baseball and football he he's there's question as to whether he's going to come back i haven't read today's paper is that right there's a there's a fabulous career oh sure because they're they're tenure is anytime at all yeah but ye[ah]- yeah he may come back into baseball but i doubt if he'll ever come back and play well i would have too i that's the s[ame]- that's that's i don't understand that obvious i think football is much more strenuous than baseball you get a chance to sit down in baseball every once in a while you know if you're not up for three innings or whatever but yeah some some big fellows not out there trying to stomp you into the ground you know i mean but uh i- th[at]- that's surprising i- i was i had not heard that in the in the yeah they no i'm i'm sure they p[robably]- well it all depends i guess on on what they feel is you know what he can do because_1 baseball is not a light an easy sport either that's a very very athletic sport lot of running and stuff like that and the hip may be a real problem but i- i would think that football would have been more of a detriment to him than than baseball would well Steve i'll tell you i think i still think Joe Montana's the best quarterback that ever handled a ball and Terry Bradshaw i think is probably even better than he is or better or w[as]- was better than than Joe Montana is now because_1 i of course another another Steeler fan showing up here you know another black and yellow surfacing up here you know this is the black and blue league up here in the corner but i like Bradshaw as a quarterback and i think uh Joe Montana's probably one of the finest and John Elway i believe that fellow if he had some different people in front of him he would be on par with with Joe Montana because i really think that Denver did not do much for Elway and his career except make him look bad on times when he really should not have looked that bad yeah that's a fact i like John Elway i think he was a fab[ulous]- he he still is he's got a he's got a lot of years left in him no i don't believe so i don't believe he's going to be able to get the job done in Denver he's going to run up some big numbers and stuff but i don't believe he's going to get the job done there because Den[ver]- simply because Denver is not not the doesn't have enough depth i don't think to support him like like Joe Montana got supported with the 49ers yeah that's that could be true too yeah yeah that in-fighting can really destroy a team and its ability to win yeah pardon me oh it certainly did it most certainly did yeah we as i say we went through the Sullivans uh that that owned the team you know and and owned the stadium and it's unreal the in-fighting it was it was just it's every day in the paper was like you know it was like a saga like a like a like a soap opera it you know who's fighting with who who doesn't want to go out on the field who doesn't want to catch it's unreal i mean you know that that's really detrimental to the team well Steve it's been nice talking with you it sure has and i i'd like to try this thing every once in a while i thought i'd give it a try this afternoon being so rainy i'm locked in up here anyway so well like i say i- i guess i'll root for any football game because i really like the sport and i'm glad that was my topic today so you uh you uh take care of yourself and if you're ever up this way to TI in Attleboro look me up my name's Ray Smith and i work in building twelve okay come on up bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

um hello um what is your favorite um food for a dinner party do you do Tex-Mex oh fajitas how do you make fajitas um-hum oh oh um-hum um-hum oh it sounds good okay well that's nice oh well basically um because i lived in the Middle East for a while i tend to fix Middle Eastern foods when i have have people over and so um some of the dips are like um chick peas mashed with um sesame and um called foo[d]- um what's it called i forgot anyway and and lem[on]- that's right that's right it's called humus now i remember it and um uh dipping Arabic bread the thin pita bread in that or another dip is made with very similar but with um eggplant which has been actually barbe[cued]- it ends up with a barbecued taste although we usually bake it in the oven or if we have uh those of us that have gas stoves bake it on top just by putting it in the gas flame and sort of getting it black on the outside but mushy on the inside but barbecue is it like steaks or is it uh turkey would you barbecue a turkey or a chicken or uh-huh um-hum um-hum um-hum i'm sure that uh the chicken that we barbecue from the Middle East has a lemon garlic sauce i wouldn't imagine that a barbecued chicken would uh-huh um-hum right right well it's been fun talking to you right uh in Wyoming it would be less spicy vegetables once in a while oh dear okay very good okay bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
okay so what do you think about us getting involved in the Middle East oh i don't think we did really either well that's that's true yeah the uh th[e]- the biggest difference i got to agree was the idea that we were allowed to go and get it done rather than than set up a a line and say we're not going to let you cross this this point anymore and that really hurt the uh the peop[le]- uh the Vietnam experience uh i got to admit that one uh-huh well do you think that um by uh going over there and doing what we did that uh it's going to give us a chance for peace over there yeah that kind of well that's um-hum but is i mean is that any different than uh the way it is in even our country i mean uh back in the fifties and forties the blacks didn't like the whites the whites didn't like the blacks but we're getting to the point where we get along pretty good i mean isn't it logical that just any of th[e]- that you can solve differences like that so you um-hum so you think it comes down to education or or something like that i suppose that's probably true um-hum no oh um-hum yeah because_1 yeah i guess the uh you kind of think about the good things and not about the bad um-hum um-hum right right um-hum right well isn't it also though based on religion i mean isn't that a a real powerful um-hum well d[on't]- don't you think though that uh because of religion it just enhances the differences uh of the tribes and makes it so that it's that much harder to get along um-hum right right um-hum that's true well since there's not going to be peace over there don't you think like getting involved as we have that that's going to mean that we're going to be involved from now on and so any war that breaks out we're going to have to be in the middle of it um-hum it doesn't seem that way does it um-hum yeah i know yeah that's probably true um-hum um-hum hum true they want th[e]- the gas guzzlers yeah um-hum didn't it though yeah i- i got to agree with you there i think that does get a lot a lot of good there um-hum um-hum hum United States right um-hum let's say i'd have to say overall that the the war was was beneficial to the United States with with the change in attitudes and all that you know all that stuff i mean it's people think better about uh the US now and that's really going to i think eventually come back and and help with overall business standards i mean people are going um take more pride in their work and things like that i think it's going to really help out overall yeah um-hum yeah um-hum that's right um-hum oh yeah he had some excellent military people i- i was the person i was impressed with most i mean i- i really you know Colin Powell and and General Schwartzkopf they're military people but i really didn't know that Cheney was as military minded as he is i mean that's right i well he was what uh a Senator from Utah or something like that i can't remember where yeah and see i don't know that and it w[ell]- you know i was real impressed with his handling of this i know that oh yeah um-hum i don't think very many people are yeah um-hum yeah there was uh there was a lot of talk about the idea that the even the uh Iraqis themselves the people wished we would have done that uh yeah well unless they finally do take care of it themselves but you know you kind of have to wonder whether it's going to be any better with uh you know depending on whether it Shiite Muslim or uh or the Kurds in power but uh you know well that's true too yeah um-hum um-hum yeah that's true yeah especially the cost of that an[d]- and uh uh the attitudes of the soldiers i mean they're there the[y]- i think they could handle it better but if they came back and then had to turn around and go the attitudes would be just horrible yeah that's probably true um-hum so do you think it's you do think it's a good idea for us to have uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay um my major source of information i guess is TV news excuse me i uh wake up to it in the morning this is my i guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning while i'm getting ready to go to work oh i quite frequently uh glance through headlines or in the newspaper but uh primarily mine is uh TV news how about_1 yourself um true uh-huh well that's true but uh i uh my personal opinion is that the uh the various network news medias were uh trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military now i can appreciate that especially after what happened in Vietnam uh but i mean let's face it to[day's]- today's uh means of communications we could uh very well a newscaster could very well give aw[ay]- away a piece of top secret information and uh pat himself on the back for for uh making a big scoop very true i find T News very enlightening and i check that everyday and of course with that goes along the the stock price of TI of course T News i[s]- is more or less headlines uh i don't think much of of their sports coverage all they give the scores but uh that's right i'm not yeah outside of of uh pro football i'm not too interested in other ga[mes]- uh other sports anyway but uh the the T News is is a good way to keep up to date i think they do a pretty good job selecting the most important items uh-huh well i spent twenty years in prof[essional]- in uh commercial broadcasting ten in radio and then ten in uh TV and i know what it takes to get some of those little bits a[nd]- of bits and pieces of news on the air uh i mean there there are times where uh vide[o]- uh reporter actually will risk is life life and limb i've seen it happen time and time again and uh well i remember one time up in Nashville Tennessee was one of the f[ellows]- fellows got mixed up in a with a riot going on down there but he was lucky he got out of it for some reason because he was carrying a camera uh they left him alone um-hum nice talking to you too Jim no oh well i'll have to be looking for it then is that right well good you too	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay um-hum um i think there should be some control but on the same hand i think you should be uh like a[nd]- and some cities i think you should be to carry guns no i'm not well um i i'm kind of i'm i'm about two hours north of Pittsburgh and there's some[times]- i won't sometimes i won't go down there at night you know no and um my fiance is about an hour of DC and that you wouldn't catch me dead down there no um-hum yeah exac[tly]- yeah uh-huh uh-huh exactly yeah um-hum um-hum no um-hum um-hum oh really oh i didn't even know that yeah well that's the way it is i think anywhere because li[ke]- like just in in DC like my fiance said like um he went to the doctors one time and it was located in DC and he had to park his car you know and his car was like two blocks away from the the clinic and the clinic had someone escort him to his car because_1 it got dark it was after sunset yeah now tha[t's]- that's just ridiculous you i mean that that's just down right ridiculous and i know driving through Pittsburgh you know we got lost and we we're trying to come home and um we went through this one section and there were you know all the people standing on the corner and and stuff and i was just like well wind up my window lock my door i was just like don't you dare stop i don't care run the red light just get out of here is that's awful uh-huh um-hum yeah exactly like i would call my fiance and well he moved now so he's in a much nicer area but he lived like twenty minutes out of downtown DC and i would be talking to him on the phone and i could hear sirens and i could hear yelling and screaming and i'm like what's going on and he'd go to the window and he'd watch a policeman chase someone down the sidewalk a[nd]- and i'm just like and he and another thing was he lived on the ground floor of an apartment building and i was just like would you please move just get out of there please i i mean i just don't think it's safe um-hum yeah um-hum exactly yeah yeah well um i come from a large family and all my brothers hunt so we have hunting guns but they're always locked up at all times other than when they're being used and even whenever like you know like like if three of them are out hunting and there's still three guns left it's still locked you know it's locked all the time but as far as having anything else to protect ourselves we don't have anything you know other than maybe a butcher knife that's up on the but what's your chances of getting to it or something um-hum yeah but uh i know my um roommate she's from Latrobe and that's right out of Pittsburgh and her father is a state policeman and she has mace you know even to carry like i'm i'm at college so even for her when she goes out at night if her and i are out like if we walk to another building or something we always take the mace with us y[ou]- you know just because you know two girls walking but um her mom sells real state so her mom has a gun in her purse at all times because she has to pick up strangers that you know people that she's never met and take them to these houses and they're in her car so she he taught he has three daughters he taught all three daughters and his wife how to shoot and and i can very well see his point um-hum yeah um-hum uh-huh um-hum but then and and you know and sometime[s]- you know i think that like when whenever i graduate i'll be moving to where my fiance is and i'll definitely want to have something if we're even a half hour away from DC i will want something you know but then again you know you would always want to keep it locked up or something then you know well then what's the sense of keeping it locked up because then if something would happen are you going to have time to actually go and it and g[et]- you know and y[ou]- you you hate keeping something laid out like that oh my gosh no why would i i just don't people are sick for doing that they just wanted his money um-hum yeah i[t's]- i[t's]- gun co[ntrol]- it's just always one of those iffy situations i think people should be allowed to protect themselves but then you know like you know so many families you know you don't want to let a gun out because accidents do happen i[f]- if um-hum um-hum yeah like i had a neighbor and uh he got shot in the stomach with a gun and to this day they declare that the gun was not loaded and i just cannot get that out of my mind now obviously the gun was loaded you know but to this day they swear the gun was not loaded and i'm just like well he has half his stomach missing i i i'm just like well well then where did his stomach go you i mean he survived you know but he was lucky that's all there was to it uh-huh i i i just think it's an iffy situation	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

um regarding health care it's funny because i have a sister who lives in Europe and in Europe that's the way it is health care is just right exactly and um the the interesting thing is that it seems that they don't even think about it it's not anything that seems to be um you know costing everybody a lot of money it's not a major topic of conversation it's just something that's done and accepted well um i think the government subsidizes most of it but i- i believe that that again just people are taxed a little bit more but it's just interesting how something you know that we consider just such a major issue is just in such working order there you know what do you feel about it yes um-hum um um-hum um-hum the twenty percent and and the sad part is that people to to you know combat this they just won't go to the doctor or they won't fill their prescriptions i mean that you know that's the alternative um-hum um-hum i know um-hum um-hum oh i know i know oh yeah it's true and i don't think that that burden should be put on companies either i don't think that they should have to assume the responsibility of paying for the person's health care oh yeah um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum oh you did wow um-hum um-hum i know well and well you know you're not the only one though um i'm in a situation where when i started my job they were paying full benefits i thought great you know can't get any better and then slowly each year you know now they're down to seventy five percent and then they went down to fifty percent and and i understand they have to do that with the prices going up and up but um you just might as well knock of a couple thousand dollars from your salary you know to pay for this medical care and then i- i don't have kids so i'm not worrying about family coverage but once you get into family coverage it's crazy i[t]- it's just crazy yes um-hum um-hum right they have a hundred dollars to spend in December i know what you yeah we do that too we're fortunate though this year somehow how it's only March and we've already used up our amount i don't know if that's good or bad i don't know um i think it covers a portion because like i said my sister lives over there and they they just they just never have to worry about it i think it might not cover full dental but it does cover some and again it covers you know major things it won't cover cosmetic type things you know if you choose to do something but um it's just like all in it's just all in practice it's all in plan i think that we could learn from that i don't know i really don't know i know that they do equally as well there as they do here i mean doctors still have that same status i don't know i guess they're getting paid for it one way or another and and i would imagine although i don't know maybe there still are private practices there i don't know i don't know but um it would be great and and if only i mean health is probably the one thing that people should be most concerned with you know espec[ially]- that makes a good society when people are healthy and they're not you know they're not stealing for money to pay for their doctors' bills you know they're they're going to work every day because they're not sick you know i mean just something that should be more of a priority than it is now yeah um-hum um-hum well at least let them start off gradually you know fine so they won't jump into paying full health care let them pay you know partial and each year just you know let's increase it from there i don't know but um-hum it'll take a while maybe our grandchildren know yeah um-hum um-hum well it was nice talking to you yeah maybe one day we'll all have health care it's what oh i know like i said everyone's been in from Texas all righty well take care okay bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

and i guess well i kind of like them_1 all i played for about eighteen years a[ll]- all the way through college and then uh kind of hung them_1 up after college but no not quite made it yeah made it all the way through four years of college playing ball but anyway uh being in Rochester you probably like the Mets oh boy it the i think it's like one or the other isn't it i mean you either yeah oh okay i see yeah i i like the uh uh i guess if i had to pick a favorite team i'd i anymore uh well as i kind of grew up rooting for Philadelphia i'm from New Jersey originally yeah well we were thirty miles south of them_1 so right yeah right down the river but uh so what are the Mets going to do this year without Strawberry yeah um-hum yeah uh well i was going to talk to you about that eighty six team that was that was the year that uh they beat Houston in uh extra innings right yeah yeah hey the guy's making millions he ought to be able to perform right well his knees were bothering him yeah yeah for having him out there sure oh boy yeah i think we were all pretty much uh Astros fans in the in the N[ational]- National League Championship Series but there's like two fellows from uh Brooklyn and they they were you know they were they were pretty much without having to say it they were pretty much Mets fans no not really they they were they were pretty much thugs they weren't scared of very much you know yeah yeah really okay okay well i'm not to say that all folks from Brooklyn are thugs but these two were definitely thugs and they were from Brooklyn so i'm kind of hoping i i i guess uh anymore i pretty much pull for the Rangers though they were uh they're they're they're they they have the i think they have the best facilities in the major leagues i love going to watch a game in Arlington stadium it's great yeah the only problem is it's not large enough it only holds about i think they s[queezed]- when Ryan struck out his five thousandth player they they squeezed about forty thousand people in there yeah so they're they're they have plans i mean the the owner tried to move them_1 to Florida but uh they ended up sticking around in Arlington and they're going to build a new stadium in Arlington as a matter of fact not even in Dallas so that's that's something that we're looking forward to oh y[eah]- case in point Toronto yeah have you seen a game up there oh boy i saw i i was up there on business uh last June and watched a game in the sky dome it was just phenomenal that's that's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums i think yeah uh-huh now i[s]- is Rochester where where is Cornell University Ithaca okay yeah well Rochester's like right on the shores isn't it yeah okay uh well they say that from that space needle up in Toronto you can see the lights of Rochester on a clear night yeah yeah yeah okay yeah those games are fun to watch you you you watch those games yeah um-hum um-hum yeah yeah we used to like watching my my folks lived down in Beaumont and uh o[n]- on the campus of Lamar University they used to house the the Beaumont Golden Gators who were a double A team for the Padres i think but uh they they were fun games to watch someti[mes]- well there's definitely a lot more hitting yeah yeah so as far as the major league teams i don't know i[t]- the Rangers have been y[ou]- you know every year they they always knock on a door early and then just go into their skid about you know the end of June but they they've got so much young raw talent it's just amazing and then they just haven't been able to put anything together um-hum yeah um-hum right yeah i mean they've been they've been young for a while and they're alm[ost]- almost starting to age a bit here i just um yeah they they're they're really hurting pitching wise i mean they've got Ryan but you know who knows what he'll be able to do he's been last year he started having some nagging injuries and but it'll it'll be interesting to watch i hope to get up there we we usually try to get to opening day game there's several guys from our church try to go up there yeah well i i guess we're probably oh maybe a hundred fifty miles south of Dallas no not too bad about it takes about two hours two and a half hours to get there that's probably because_1 of the roads you just don't yeah we we've just got a freeway we just get right on the freeway and just go north well it's so crowded up there golly yeah um well i don't know you're you're you're like a boat ride from h[ow]- how far is it across the lake to Canada Toronto yeah you do you drive there or do you take the ferry or what yeah yeah it's a it's a beautiful city i really like it um-hum so and then and then you go back to New York after school or New York City oh really well what what kind of weather are you having right now oh boy yeah we've been up in the oh seventies eighties even up in the nineties a couple weeks ago already we're it's golly because_1 of the ice hum golly illegal oh yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay so what kind of car are you thinking about getting well when you decide to uh-huh so you like the Ford uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh right uh-huh Yeah it's the this the car i had before this one was a Thunderbird as a matter of fact and uh i loved it i really did But uh um i finally decided to go check out what the uh what the uh foreign cars were So i bought myself a a a Nissan a two forty S X But even though i love the car i've got now i think my next car will probably be American again because if i can at all do it i'd like to stay American i always have up until now i just for one time decided to go outside So uh-huh uh-huh right uh-huh uh-huh well Ford's done a real good job in the last uh say ten years or at least the last five to te[n]- six years so of really turning around their um quality i think um uh-huh um uh-huh oh yeah those were not good cars uh-huh uh-huh right uh-huh uh-huh right uh-huh uh-huh You know the only thing i'm looking at right now um i just i just bought you know the Nissan that i've got about uh say nine months ago i guess it was So the only thing that that would um get me to change cars right now would be if see at the moment i'm single and if i were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it But uh i don't have any plans for probably another two three years of even looking you know uh cars are too expensive right now to uh to even think about buying new cars every couple of years you know it's uh-huh uh-huh um uh-huh yeah that's uh i went to a a car show down here about uh about two weeks ago and um you know of course they had the normal the Ford the the Chevrolet that stuff But then you started looking at the uh uh they had Ferrari there they had uh BMW and and all these other kind of cars and and Ferrari didn't even let you near the car i mean they were that's how expensive they were um and then you saw uh hundred thousand dollar cars you saw eighty thousand dollar cars and you know even even though i i i do enjoy cars i enjoy um driving them i enjoy uh riding in them and everything but uh i can't see buying or paying more for a car than i would for a house you know i that doesn't seem likely uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i think so that's happened to me once so uh yeah like uh you know i think the one time i did it was on Sau[di]- the Mid the Mid East the crisis out there and everything that was had a great conversation but uh then they came off and us we couldn't do it any more so uh-huh yeah you too uh-huh bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
sure okay is it well um yeah i'd i agree with the the ease in the use of it and uh the it certainly it's so much easier to do your do computations calculations to measure things with it to in every every aspect of it is simpler except there is one big stumbling block in it and in the United States and that is all of the tool and die equipment in this country that has been here for the last hundred years is in the English system and tool and die equipment doesn't wear out too often so i think that's the the one place where uh they will have a hard time uh getting people to change uh-huh right uh-huh uh-huh sure uh-huh uh-huh exactly right right i uh lived in Brazil for four years from when i was seven to eleven years old and so by the time i got into high school and took some physics there and then into college um where i was a physics major in college so i'm more than uh familiar with the metric system and uh but i think that initial period you know from way made it familiar for me so i wasn't afraid of the metric system and it and and i knew how much it made sense and how much easier it was to do things that way so i i it's too bad that more Americans can't don't have the opportunity to to really use it to to get to a point where it it's something other than something that causes them fear and confusion because if you just the ini[tial]- in the initial stages of anything no matter even if it is something that ultimately will be simpler are going to be confusing and it's getting over that hurdle that will finally get us into it if we ever get into it right right okay yep right right right that may be true also i don't know chemists seem to it okay no i mean can you imagine how ridiculous it would be to try to do calc[ulations]- i mean it boggles the mind to try to think to do all the chemistry or physics in the English system at this point although gosh all those uh-huh uh-huh right it's interesting in the in though the work i'm doing i'm uh uh the kind of things i do is manage uh research and development contracts and we do everything from basic research all the way through uh we have a couple of systems that are actually um places where they're producing a product and what i've noticed is that the places where they're kind of doing fuzzy thinking and uh doing the initial uh development of an idea use the metric system and they talk in terms of metric uh uh units in turn around the people however that have the engineers that are actually producing a product do most of their carry conduct most of their discussion in terms of the English units which i i find it's interesting that it's like the guys that are still doing the work that are actually making the stuff are using the English system but the ones that come up with the they're doing these theoretical analysis and the number crunching um are doing it in terms of the metric system i i it kind of seems strange but and Sao Paulo uh-huh no kidding uh and do you fly into Camgonias or the the other one down there down south yeah okay the international air[port]- yeah uh-huh sure sure uh the Air Force Academy uh i'm one of those yeah no no i'm i'm still in the i'm still a second lieutenant i just graduated in eighty nine uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh right right right oh that's it you got to oh yeah right well the the whole yeah i don't or the whole number system is digital so how can you have uh or it's it's base ten rather and so how can you have how can you have these uh stran[ge]- i- i-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
hi Debbie how are you what do you think of this weather oh i love it yeah yes you can hear her huh uh-huh yeah i have a four year old and a one year old so uh yeah i'm glad it was nice too i got a chance to to go outside and just have a nice day the um i remember last year wasn't it raining a lot this yeah all that flooding and everything i'm glad we don't have that this year so far uh-huh we live just north of Trinity Mills and it floods there you know quite a lot um it's not it doesn't usually damage any businesses or anything but you can't get off of thirty five to um to go to Home Depot and that's a problem yes or Target for that matter now uh-huh oh yeah yeah we're not from Texas either um we're i grew up in Pennsylvania so yeah it it's not like this it's awfully hot yeah oh you're kidding sure oh i'm sure i- i think you would probably down here yeah i'd j[ust]- i think it's a necessity we um we have i guess we bought that my car in Colorado that's where we we moved from and uh so we we had a feeling we'd be coming back this way and again there they don't sell all the cars with air conditioning it's you know it's really a not it's almost a luxury we didn't have air conditioning in our house or anything oh yes it does no i don't think so either no oh no we didn't even have any of the famous Dallas ice storms no isn't that surprising uh-huh oh oh my gosh well you know we lived in Colorado for four years i guess so and we you know we had a lot of snow and i- i really don't miss that my husband says he certainly doesn't mind sh[oveling]- missing the shoveling i mea[n]- we had a big sidewalk and he didn't like that at all but i don't know yeah oh definitely uh-huh that's right it doesn't matter right Colorado wasn't bad for that because um it is so at least in Colorado Springs where we lived it was so sunny most of the time that at right after it snowed it would almost always be a bright sunny day and all of the roads would be clear you'd still have the snow on the yard the kids could play in it but it'd be a bright sunny day and you know it would it would melt and you could drive around and it was really no big deal yeah yeah really that's good they scaled down quite a bit they have a lot of changes out there lately that's true certainly not but we i don't know i- i- i- i don't really miss the snow i miss the change of seasons myself the fall is what i really miss from Pennsylvania yeah it just turns brown and makes a mess nothing pretty about it um-hum my folks don't live in uh Pennsylvania anymore but for a long time i would purposely go back and visit in October just so i could see the trees and the fall and such a pretty time uh-huh it really is and i think you don't i growing up there i just assumed that's how it was all over the country i never really realized it was such a local thing i yeah nope yeah they they do yeah i do too i'm ready to get outside and get the kids outside and seems to j[ust]- even my one year old it really changes her temperament she can be in here all grouchy and put her outside and hey she's fine um-hum my my son b[orn]- he was born in Colorado and when we first moved here um he was three i guess just turned three and for the first week we were here it was over a hundred every single day it was in July and he was lethargic he really he wasn't used to the heat at all he would go outside and he'd turn into a zombie and walk around like he didn't know what was going on but he's used to it now i think he's i mean he certainly doesn't like the heat but he doesn't become lethargic uh-huh uh-huh that's a good word for it really hot well it's been good talking to you hopefully we'll have some more good weather but we'll see all righty bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

i suppose i do because i've seen a lot of those changes the the changes that women have had in the last genera[tion]- well you know not even the last generation the last fifteen years twenty years going from well take it back thirty years i'm going back too far from my parents' generation when mom stayed home period an[d]- and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job until well unless if you were educated you got you know you might teach for a year or two before you got married and if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something you know if you had if you were a teacher then you know that was it until the kids you were little yes there was not there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the the bathroom floors be on any given day and then and then of course today it's supposed to be all the other way you're supposed to only want the job and and uh your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care and and we have these wonderful people who are who are totally prepared to tea[ch]- to teach your child everything they need to know in day care and and uh we'll see how the generations go huh yeah i at least for a lot of women depending on on what she did i've i was an engineer with uh mechanical engineer with T I and uh i did it for six years and for one well i had one while i was pregnant and then one while my oldest was a year old and and it just drove me crazy i could not do either well enou[gh]- i couldn't put in enough overtime that was necess[ary]- or that you know things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on Saturdays as is you know as is needed and because my husband had had for a long time was out of the country also with uh with work for like three months and and yeah yeah it might have been better yeah yeah and so it was in my case i i just uh decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once well actually i've found out that i'm not going to go back to being an engineer i'm i'm i'm a photographer now i have i have branched out i was a photographer before but when i went to college it was i felt like i couldn't support myself if i decided to be a photographer that it would just have to be a hobby and i'm i'm very mechanical and mechanical engineering interested me so i did that and then i you know i did that for six years and then i stayed home with my son and did nothing and found out that i was that you know it was great but i was bored part of the time too and i wanted something else to do yeah and it['s]- it's great while they're really little but as they get older and they're more independent and there's things to do then it's good for them to go to different i mean it he goes to a a mother's day out program now once a week both of my kids do and so they're getting they they get the socialization with other kids and y[ou]- you know and not really school but but a different authority than mom once in a while you know and kind of learning how to deal with society yeah i think they do too and i need it for the break so um-hum and enjoy it that's that's the whole thing yeah yeah i think that's the thing that were going to see well i think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next ten year[s]- even in the even now they're starting to do it but i think it's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years is that there's going to be a lot of women and they're going to have to work it out to working part time because if if i if i had been allowed to work you know maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week i might still be working basically full time or part time if there was if there had been some way to work it out because i liked my job really well but i was just pulled in so many different directions i was it was just driving me crazy and now with the photography that's you know it's working that's what i'm doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the uh week and and use those hours to do the the thing that i'm doing is taking school pictures in day cares and in mother's day out programs and also soccer teams and you know different stuff like that so my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week or my husband if it's you know an[d]- an[d]- when he's at home can take care of them i think they're really going to have to and not and not just for mothers for fathers as well it's going to have to be both yeah you know it's just convincing your husband that's important or that that that it's important enough for him to do it because if he saw mom doing only that you know all the time he was growing up then it's hard to think of it in that other you know uh that i should do it or tha[t]- or just to think about doing it rather than having someone tell him to do it i know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help and even though we were both working the same number of hours and and doing things i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done this is what you do it now yes and yeah and without and and it's just they don't look at things most men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it they just you know just kind of scoot it on another spot on the on the sink and and put the next plate down and and in a while get around to it and i think most women walk in and and and with oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say now this needs to be do[ne]- this is the time this needs to be done but that's right yeah um-hum yeah um-hum and i think that's that's going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls it's not they're not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there you know you both got to they were both working at whatever things were needed to be done they're going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it's a woman's job or a man's job but because it's dirty and it needs to be cleaned and it's gonna it's gonna yeah some kids are really having it If they'd been in day care the entire time and it wasn't yeah the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases young college yeah yeah yeah yeah i think that was one of the main reasons that i quit was because i wanted my kids to have my values and i felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it that it could be it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little you know this is the way i feel about this and this is the way because_1 i it's you know when you when you if you if you teach them when they're little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you just you add onto it as they get older but if no one does anything when they're little then it's twice as hard as i think as they get older yes i understand i i wait until i put mine in bed before i make my calls yeah that's the thing if woman's role like we said if women's roles change drastically men's roles will too and a lot of it's for the better some of the some of the women's roles i think are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things going back to work but i think if we can if we can expand the men's roles at the same time like your taking care of your child and your dad probably didn't very often i know i know mine almost never did	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well Patricia i was just about to get on my tread mill and then i remembered that i didn't make a call last night and i thought i'd make one tonight that's what i did with mine for a long time put it on the handlebars so i can hang them up and sometimes she just flops them all over the seat uh-huh i like it no it's just as boring i read a book while i'm doing it but i was doing that on the exercise bike i feel like i'm getting a little better of a workout and i'm losing more weight on this than i had on the other and my legs you know how okay i'm going to turn forty this summer i was getting all dimpled and those are going away so that's real good we got it at a little bit of an incline uh this one yeah this is five hundred i know they get cheaper but i don't know uh-huh well i hope so yeah i didn't buy it really my husband bought it because we we'd we'd never get out and go walking or anything and we go to the lake and we ski and swim in the summer but besides that uh-huh yeah uh-huh i think your voice sounds familiar where do you wo[rk]- i wonder if we talked before i'm in Garland you sound like this girl that i talked to about books and we got into movies one night uh-huh let's see education uh social changes that we've seen in the last ten twenty thirty years yeah that one was the most boring one was about what meal would you cook for a sit down dinner the other woman didn't cook too much either right yeah they do i talked to this old woman that was a retired administrator in Ohio one night about education and she was uh-huh she retired but yeah and then one night i talked to these two guys no one night i talked to one guy and then a couple of weeks later i talked to the guy's roommate in Virginia about different things yeah uh-huh one was about painting when was the last time you painted something did you feel like you did a good job did you feel uh rewarded while you were doing it i don't i don't know hum-um well how'd you find out about it how did you find out about it uh-huh uh-huh i have a friend that had a roommate that worked at TI and she saw it on the computer screen and they made copies of it uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh well if you work for TI you're supposed to get a prize is what i heard and if you don't work for them you're supposed to get cash but then on the letter it says cash or prize i don't know gobs this is going on my fourth week to do it well like what tell me yeah for how many calls does it say uh-huh uh-huh <b_aside> you need to start the grill <e_aside> no i'm trying not to he's telling me to start the grill so it's not all stuff that TI makes uh you mean the clocks yeah oh God did they mail that to you or he brought it to you huh yeah so you're bound to find something you want yeah well you know uh well do you know you have a ten limit a ten minute time and then well that's okay and then they come on and tell you and they they tell you got five seconds to say good-bye we'll keep talking if we want to come up with something else let's see oh i tried exercise classes and i never would go we find we joined ex[ercising]- yeah uh-huh they don't either well well the first one i joined they went out of business and they transferred it to another one that was really far away uh-huh and we were going to do it there was four of us together well then forget that it wasn't near me and then the second time i was going to do it at Richland College and we i just get with another friend and we'd end up just smoking cigarettes and riding around like we couldn't find the place so my husband's just discouraged me on those things oh yeah my husband said he's never joined a course right and i got one of those Jane Fonda workout tapes that i dubbed from a friend that didn't last long i got one of those after i had a baby i think definitely two oh Lord you're lucky well i've got a stepdaughter she's in college so there's where the money goes where's you ki[ds]- two we uh where you going to school and what are you doing yes i do i just got my certification huh-uh the test is a booger it the test the exit test it's hard it is so hard see i didn't have to take any other exit test because i've been teaching for quite a while but i've heard they're terrible bilingual is just horrendous i've had friends fail that twice good yeah right after you get out boring and they really don't help you a whole lot now see i went to ET and i took one course through TWU but most of the good training i've got has been through Dallas just teaching ESL see i'm a Chapter One Teacher and some of my classes are ESL	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

uh-huh a Mark seven uh what do the Mark sevens usually run thirty five K well there's a tremendous amount of money alright i see i agree about that uh American cars should be the ones to be bought um i just wish their quality would to still improve further oh yes it's a matter of time it's probably going to be another two to five years before they're really up to par where they should be and then i believe the majority of American people will yeah they will already have in fact i have one myself i'm reluctant to admit she does Honda Accord yes that's one what year model is it eighty nine well that's fairly new m[ine]- mine is an eighty four Sentra and the only problem i've ever experienced major type problem i've experienced is a a fuel pump had to be replaced and it's got eighty four thousand no it's got eighty nine thousand miles on it now you do no major malfunctions then i see well that's good to hear in Consumer Digest or a Consumer Reports a Taurus uh-huh well that's not too bad in price listing it has an eight cylinder oh yeah correct Lee Iacocca stressed on the mini van uh i mean the mini van has been one of the best top of the line vehicles for Chrysler isn't it um their durability is a lot better i understand than most other vans right there's a lot of uh duplicity in the vehicles the way the build them too insofar as their design um uh American even foreign but i'm sure it's all for streamlining or for air streamlining right <b_aside> uh yeah <e_aside> just a second <b_aside> going to pick them up <e_aside> excuse me for a moment <b_aside> right i'm fixing to get them right now <e_aside> excuse me i had to uh talk to my boss okay so i guess we have nothing to do on the other end there's no uh interruptions here to tell us that we're done or okay later	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah well i can understand that it's it's that time of the year uh we just uh my wife and i just recently moved into our house so we're spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things but um i like to keep up to date too um i guess in the since i got out of college which was about five years ago i've my TV viewing has started to tend more towards uh documentary news programs things like that something that's going to keep me up to date i've kind of kind of gotten away from uh being a series watcher having to keep up to date with uh um-hum yeah that makes a big difference okay yeah i yeah started too and uh kind of kind of from that i- i have a hard time sticking with something like on on on on TV because_1 it like it gets real aggravating if you miss it for a week or two you feel kind of left out but um um-hum i believe that um-hum um-hum yeah that's right yeah well i- i know exactly how you feel that's right i- i uh when i first moved down here uh moved into the apartment and got cable and uh i guess i- i sort of kind of became n[umb]- numb uh nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the TV you know and then all of a sudden i started paying paying attention to um to network TV again once in a while right now we don't have cable and it's surprising how much it's changed the you know the the the whole moral situation everything is just just gone one whole complete direction different and uh w[e]- we don't have any kids yet but uh i i[t]- i- i feel the same way it's really tough to find something that's that's uh that's going to be good and interesting for the kids even even cartoons um y[ou]- you know you you watch uh you watch some of the cartoons and kids kids aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there it none of it's probably damaging lot of times but uh right right oh yes yeah that's right that's right well that's true uh-huh that's i'm glad you said it and i didn't have to but that that that's the i feel the exact same way i sit i sit and watch some shows and uh and i'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show ah it's you know why do you do this to yourself yeah okay yeah right now there's an idea um okay yeah yeah yeah that's that's pretty good i i can't handle it very long i i mean i'm i'm a i'm a sports fan but uh i[t]- it's well it's kind of it's kind of like reading magazines any more if if half of the time wasn't spent watching commercials it probably wouldn't be so bad but uh it it's you're missing an awful lot i'd rather personally rather watch see a game on T V than fight the crowds at the stadium but uh but uh no i don't sit down i'll i'll sit down for the big games the Super Bowl and the championship you know things like that but i don't i don't follow any team i i i check the scores the next morning and i know how everybody's doing and that suffices me but uh i like i like good comedy good humor once in a while well no we don't yeah yeah right uh-huh that works you bet yeah yeah no i don't know if there's any any series or anything that i pay attention to i try to watch Cheers once in a while yeah it is in fact it's i think it's on tonight i just got in from outside so i so i'm kind of out of it th[ings]- things like that and i i consider that fairly intelligent humor you know and uh you can tell they they they pick up the words every once in a while yeah i try to yeah if well yeah you know and and it was it was just automatic too no matter where you were you stopped and and sat down and watched it i think it's come around again it's gone through cycles but uh uh-huh yeah that's right that's right right that's for sure that is for sure well i guess there's a few things around still but uh yeah sounds like we pretty much agree well its been uh good talking to you okay you too bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

uh so you have children i take it you don't so it's not a very valid topic uh yes one stepdaughter ten and uh you know how they are at that age i guess you having been ten once yourself oh we have one uh Keeshonden yeah fuzzy little thing a fuzzy little dog rather rather odd personality he he he's fun anyway uh time we spend with our children it seems almost as though children hate it yes time spent with mom and dad is uh next is that's probably one of the worst punishments on earth to them an[d]- yeah i they you know parents are a curse that they just have to live with so it it's interesting we do spend time driving in the mountains no do you work for TI you're working then with every passing day we wonder if we will be it's it's better to to be employed especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner and that creates family tensions yes no no i don't have any an[y]- children uh well it varies what it is of course but usually mom and dad are a curse you know they they'd much rather be with friends friends are cool parents aren't but i remember well i'm sure part of it is a male female thing you know i- i remember whenever i was growing up often times spent with my Dad was oh just wonderful you know go go hunting or go to the races or or oh any number of things and we'd have um great times and it seems that well now the bank's not available and entirely too much time is spent my wife and i were wondering what if and and what if's always rough but you know we do have our trips and we do have our fun and i don't know little girls aren't interested in lot of the same things little boys are or were hunting and and looking for arrowheads and uh but they don't like it there there there is a difference there and th[e]- and well girls at that age video games boys and malls not necessarily in that order and friends of course and that's a little tough for fathers fathers don't even like malls they despise shopping so is that quality time yeah if but there is camping and we both enjoy that somewhat yeah yeah getting up in the mountains an[d]- getting away from it all and that's somewhat fun it's so what do you think about child rearing is how how would you spend time with kids oh yeah yeah but well yeah and amazingly a lot of times it's real easy you know a lot of times whenever we head out of town on a trip or something it's real easy to swing in there for breakfast breakfast and run and breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway and uh kids eat funny and little girls are worse about it than little boys they or or something yeah go on a diet or they they have a well to some extent the public schools or the schools in general influence them the eating meat kick you know it like it's really morally wrong to eat meat or something i- i'm not sure of course that's not the way i was raised being raised in West Texas oh yeah born in Denton raised in Lubbock so i understand about bass but it but it is interesting i- i will tell you yeah every person out there should have kids at least once or or have some that they can borrow for a time because everyone needs some torture in their lives uh but Jenny is a sweet kid and and yeah we do do things and it it's funny it's almost like a lot of things that were available to us as children to go do the money's not available you know we were talking about how much it cost to go to Disney Land golly a couple three hundred dollars you know for just just a day not in[cluding]- you know a day or two not including lodging and food and all that it's i don't see how anyone can afford it and i understand Six Flags is real expensive now oh yeah twenty bucks a whack now but at least once you pay your way in there at Six Flags yeah yeah food and junk to carry out so that's that's not as bad but golly you know Disney World or Disney Land well our problem is that you know a trip to Six Flags or Disney World or uh Disney Land or God forbid Disney World would take forever or you'd have to pay air fare and oh for a fam[ily]- you know for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick and rent a car when you get there and all that yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

what kind of lawn and garden work do you do oh does it really i didn't know that did um you've been working on it for three years really what have you done uh-huh you know i can barely hear you yeah a little bit yeah uh-huh oh wow how did you get rid of them_1 pardon oh Dursban Two yeah Dursban will get rid of just about anything i think but um so you haven't had a problem with that since yeah what else did it k[ill]- did it kill anything else it wasn't supposed to not really yeah really well that's pretty wild w[e]- yeah we used it for fleas we had fleas in our yard real bad last year and we did that um i just i'm not basically i like to mow the lawn believe it or not but i sometimes have problems starting the mower so a lot of times i don't get out and do it but my husband basically does most of it and he does the you know edging and all that kind of thing and we're renting and so we don't really put a lot of money into the uh you know th[is]- like this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt and some Saint Augustine we just we have winter rye out back and we have i don't even know what it out front but um we this is the first house we've ever lived in and we're just not real into the lawn probably because_1 we rent i guess huh but anyway right uh-huh we get what oh really hm i wonder why it does uh-huh uh-huh yeah really well i'll have to remember that because_1 uh hopefully we won't have them_1 this year but we have a cat that comes in and out and the cat was getting um fleas and stuff and bringing them_1 in the house so we had a real problem last year with fleas and it was uh quite a drag because um we got them_1 in our house and we're Christians and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas and we got rid of them_1 believe it or not with smoke bombs which is just about impossible to do but we did and so we don't want them_1 back this year you so i'll remember that if we see it's a problem in the yard we almost they were so bad last year even ticks it i don't know we've had ticks before a lot and we've had to get out and treat our lawn for that i think we used Dursban we used Dursban and Diazinon and get out there and do what you do with that thing you know and spread it all out everywhere but that's about the extent of our lawn care so i don't know do you enjoy doing it yeah well that's well that's funny yeah not everybody enjoys it though everybody has a different things i kind of enjoy it and my husband doesn't i kind of have to sometimes i'm too busy to get out there and do it and he you know he doesn't really enjoy doing it but he'll do it and he doesn't gripe about it or anything but you know i'm kind of like you and he's kind of like your wife and you know in that he doesn't really enjoy it but i would like to have a garden though that's my thing but right now where we're living we have the trees where the uh roots are at the top of the ground everywhere all over the ground i don't know what kind of trees they are but you can't have a gar[den]- you can't till it or it'll it'll tear up a nice tiller so we're going to wait until we move we don't have a lot of sun either because_1 it big trees back there so we're going to wait and when we move that's one of our priorities is to get a house where we can have a um garden and so i'd like to do that i have a feeling i'll be out there all the time taking care of that but that's our next thing do you have a garden um-hum oh are you kidding that sounds fun where do y'all live oh really wh[at]- southwest where oh really oh because_1 we're in Dallas i guess i assumed you were here well that's neat and um yeah that's what we want we have a yeah that's really what we want but we just haven't been able to do that yet so one day we'll be able to do it and i'm excited about it and then i don't know anything about it and i'll have to learn and maybe i'll give you a on what do you do in your garden and i'll go nothing what is should i do but anyway i guess that's about it though it sounds like we've covered all the bases so i guess we'll let you go and um do you have anything else you wanted to say okay i know you too i hope you have a nice day and we'll talk to you later bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

and all right what have you seen that's i knew you were going to say that i wanted i want to go see that gosh yeah i i i i watched uh Costner on the Academy Awards i was really happy that he got i was hoping he was going to get Best Actor uh but he he he did pretty good on that one yeah yeah i'd i bet yeah there several of them that are out right now that i want to see uh Dances uh Silence of the Lambs nah nah people yeah yeah well you know they they that's what they said about The Exorcist you know no no it's terrible you'll have nightmares you know i watched last weekend me and my roommate we we laughed about it well i'll tell well i guess i i guess it was because i'd read the book before i saw the movie and the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was yeah he's a very good writer and he had a way of putting you in that scene you know it was yeah and of course i was i was living alone at the time and it was late at night and scary and you start hearing noises you know and there's rats in the attic you know uh let's see there was a couple of others that are out and i can't remember yeah i i didn't i didn't even like the previews on that no i don't i don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway yeah i saw the original Back to the Future and then i i know i hardly ever go see a sequel i mean i think i think the only i've ever seen a sequel was Two Thousand and One uh Two Thousand and Ten was far better Two Thousand and One was a good movie if you had read the book yeah no nobody could figure it out i mean the the book was so much uh there's just things all you can do is put it in words you can't put it in pictures and a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you c[ould]- say what is this you know what's the significance of the apes you know oh the book is really good i mean i i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again and that's one of them it's it's so well written oh you're right i haven't huh oh those a real dog and cat huh huh s[ounds]- sounds sort of like The Incredible Journey uh-huh huh yeah th[at]- that sounds a lot like a Walt Disney film sounds a lot a like a Walt Disney film oh yeah not anymore i mean i i i was raised on Walt Disney films you know Old Yeller uh Big Red yeah when i was a little kid i saw The Incredible Journey on Christmas Eve and it was so good i had forgotten that it was Christmas Eve i mean that's that's something for a kid and that was something for greedy old me at Christmas time i'll tell you no is it yeah i didn't much care for the first one maybe that's well i i'll have to go get that one i guess yeah it's it's yeah i i get so tired of you know these you know sequels number nine number ten number fourteen yeah you know yeah you know Freddy Eats a Nuclear Warhead you know i i'm just i i'm so sick and tired of that i just can't believe it it's like Rocky films i i haven't seen a one i can't stand Stallone yeah and i i was afraid that Rambo was going to do the same thing that Rocky was going to do you know go into fourteen hundred episodes uh now i don't i hardly ever watch TV if i ever get the hankering to see something i've got i don't know maybe about thirty or forty movies and i just yeah i don't even rent them you know i i figure if i find a movie i like i'll buy it because_1 i just watch them over and over again yeah i yeah my my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is uh Excalibur i i loved that film um it's just so well done and i lived over in England for four years and that was the first place i ever saw it and it was just gosh it was so good it was it was filmed in Ireland and they got pretty scenery in Ireland yeah it's nice and i i've been down to the south of England where supposedly King Arthur's castle was yeah it was yeah it was unimpressive to look at i mean the whole thing was about the size of a a medium house yeah it wasn't no oh yeah yeah yeah yeah there's some nice stuff over there to see i i spent four years traveling around and didn't see you know hardly anything i just i need to go over there and stay about twenty years so i can just travel go around all the places Stonehenge of course you know every everybody makes the obligatory trip to Stonehenge okay big deal here's some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field okay it's boring you know something i come to think of it i don't think i went to the movies one time i uh where i lived uh it was a little town called Newmarket about seventy miles north of London and there was another town called Barry Saint Edmunds about twenty miles away from us and they had a little uh theater company there and we use to go go out to that about once a week yeah a really nice place you know amateurs but really quite good uh that that was interesting course used to go to London quite a lot and see shows down there uh but other than that i just didn't have time to go to the movies you know never show any anyway anything that i ever wanted i rented a lot of videos because_1 the closest movie theater was Barry Saint Edmunds and who wants who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies a lot of a lot of people did but it would have to be a good show yeah yeah i i use they they they have all these neat phrases you know you know the like critically acclaimed that's what they say when the thing hasn't won any award you know they can't yeah yeah yeah from Love Canal waterfront property here at Love Canal you know but you know critically acclaimed oh good grief give me a break that's wh[at]- i mean there's a lot of reasons why i don't go to movies and primarily i mean i now i'm probably going to going to upset you but people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

hi Wanet how are you i'm from New England Massachusetts wow this is quite a a a long distance do you have any pets how come uh you don't have any now you get tired of them_1 yeah i've got a little doggy uh that i've had quite uh quite a long time in fact she just turned sixteen years old New Year's Eve and uh i beg your pardon she's uh uh uh a poodle of a toy pood[le]- a toy poodle and she's uh this is a little bigger than a teacup and uh it's funny how uh how i i uh i g[ot]- acquired this animal uh when i was uh married my uh ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy that she needed uh the woman needed someone to babysit and uh this is what she had told the kids and she even told me that and after the two week period was up uh she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it well after you had an animal for a of weeks it's you become a[ttached]- you become attached to it so i've had this dog now for for sixteen years and she's been a lot of company uh she's uh however getting a little old and things are starting to fail um i i live alone now and she stays in the house all day while i go to work and uh she's been holding herself pretty well the uh up until uh you know recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is and uh i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home but she's she's usually pretty good uh-huh uh-huh um well you might wanna get yourself uh an animal that doesn't require much attention like a cat yeah well my my personal preference is is a dog uh i don't know that uh that i'd ever want a cat oh i like cats i just wouldn't want to own one uh they're not uh they're they're affectionate but they yeah i don't know i can't seem to communicate with a cat like i can with my dog yeah right yeah right that your supposed to appreciate them well my my dog when i came home uh when i come home in evenings sh[e]- my dog greets me at the door i don't know that a cat would do that uh yeah yeah yeah hm i i think um you know we're able to read each other pretty well because uh she knows when i'm upset and i know when she's not feeling good too so i know like when she has an accident i know she's not doing it on purpose when sh[e]- when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me uh and and you know some people might not believe that but uh but i do like if i if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours uh because i was going out she would uh break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to uh to to let me know that she was unhappy with yeah uh-huh oh yes animals have a way of i i don't know that i'd uh that i'd trade my dog in for the world uh it was about two years ago she got sick on me and i took her to the uh to the vet's because she wasn't eating and and uh she wasn't able to jump she you know lost all her activity and uh she stayed there for one day and the doctor called me up and said uh she had a low white cell count and that uh she wasn't she was dying and uh suggested that i take her to a working ho[spital]- dog hospital animal hospital so i took his suggestion and i uh took the the dog to a hospital a dog hospital and they said that they'd keep her there for three days well she ended up staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because_1 she was in intensive care it cost me over five hundred plus the the uh the vet sent me a bill for what he did and uh and then she recouped she was okay for a couple of years and then she got sick on me again and i brought her to a different vet this time and i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything and uh he gave me the medication the same medication that i gave her the last time and she was okay and she's been okay ever since it's been about two years now yeah well the see the problem is if if the if someone wouldn't have came up to me and said it's gonna cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive what do you wanna do i probably would've had second thoughts but what they well what they do is is they say well it's gonna cost you know twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this and and you know and it creeps up on you you don't know that you know you really you you don't know what it's gonna cost until it's all over uh to give you an example my mom uh had an elderly cat who uh who evi[dently]- evidently got old uh and uh the cat got sick so she took the cat to the vet and she had the cat there for two days and then the cat died so the doctor had called her up and said uh your cat died and you owe me this bill and oh by the way do you want me to to bury the cat so cost her three hundred dollars um and she didn't get the cat back so you know they had to pay for all the the medical uh bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses and uh you know she just brought the cat in because feeling so th[at]- that was a kind of a surprise at lea[st]- a[t]- yeah well even the you know they they claimed they did the best that they could and then the cat uh died so now i'm looking for another cat for them um i- i've i've got a little kitten uh that's still uh oh it just being born right now so another five or six weeks i'll be bringing the

well what's your favorite dish yeah yeah i understand that i like oriental cooking and uh pasta and i have the same problem uh Italian heritage so i definitely like pasta but i like Italian and the two don't mix though i've tried yeah that doesn't work very well either uh i don't know sort of dumb what kind of food would you have in a dinner party well i[t]- depends on what kind of people you got coming over so we'll leave it at that uh let me see what do you wh[at]- you like to cook uh just everything or do you have specialties yeah yeah um-hum um-hum yeah i um i i've been collecting recipes and modifying recipes for a long long time and uh i run a little direct mail business on the side and i finally put together a cookbook and uh i've got to i got to reformat it i i did it on my word processor and now i've got to redo the whole thing again and i'm trying to figure out a cheap way to a quick way to do it without having to retype it because_1 uh it's it's all size about it's not it's not very big i mean it's like a hundred and five pages something like that but it's got lots of good recipes so i was thinking about trying to sell that on the side just for fun um-hum well see what else can we talk about food well usuall[y]- hardly any at all anymore um i've i've gotten together sort of like basic recipes and once you have those you can add to them_1 or take away from them_1 and come up with all kinds of different dishes i i have several cookbooks uh Betty Crocker and New York Times and a couple of Japanese cookbooks a couple of Chinese cookbooks i even got a Filipino cookbook um they have a nice dish in there for a chicken dish i forgot the name of it but it takes a special kind of sausage and you can only get it at Filipino stores yeah and i[t's]- it's a it's a strange sort of it's sort of like a pepperoni but it's it has a much sharper flavor and it's uh it's almost like it has red dye in it or something when you cook it it bleeds and it colors the food it's pretty interesting but it's a real good chicken dish it's sort of like a chicken potpie in a way you have a crust on top and all that delicious though i love it yeah yeah yeah an idea yeah that's the way i am i generally get there and i have a have an idea of what i wanna do i don't really know how to get started so i i look at something get me get me ah yeah well i'll add this to it and do this and turns out pretty good sometimes yeah yeah well i mean i mean that's yeah that's the fun of cooking improvising if you're gonna sit there and just follow a recipe that's no fun you know you know a monkey can do that i bet even my cats could do that no not this one she's dead to the world right now oh well well let's see i guess that's about it on food all right good talking to you Brad take care bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
right um okay go ahead no no go ahead okay yeah yeah and that's that's funny you're in human resources and i'm in uh health and safety yes um i think it's a good idea i- i- i don't think that they've gone far enough though i think they should they should uh also test for alcohol right but yeah no and and from everything that i can gather you know reading different articles and and just a newspaper in general uh uh news on the um television it seems that alcohol is the is the most prevalent um a[ddictive]- addictive drug even though the all the college campuses now the they're saying that the majority of of uh students uh drink and most of them_1 are partying but yet we don't test for that and i wonder if we don't do that because it is so prevalent and would put probably lose a quarter of all our population here well they say your system a normal a normal person should be able to metabolize an ounce of alcohol per hour and then again it it de[pends]- depends on the the bigger you are and you know the more bulk that you have you you can your system can tolerate more alcohol so a large person can probably um metabolize maybe a little bit more than a smaller person but even that yeah if you go out you know because_1 some people go out maybe oh you know they drink up a gallon um what's what's the uh consensus down there when when uh TI announced that uh the drug testing program did you get a lot of uh animosity against that yeah yes no that's you're right yeah sure that's an idea too i just uh yeah that's a that's a thought um i don't know if you can go depends on the severity of the accident i think you know if you get like up here because we've got heavy industry we've got you know uh uh smelting plant and we've got a we've got a lot of uh metals rolling and slitting and stuff like that so we've got a lot of we are we end up with a lot of uh hand injuries you know cuts and things like that but perhaps um if you could weed out those the people that have chronic accidents and test those you know that's a start and that's a good id[ea]- that's a good point yes oh okay yeah well i can see transportation because now you're dealing with or they have the responsibility over a great number of people rather than themselves um but but thinking on that yeah because_1 we've got we've got truck drivers here that go between plants you know locally and carry material and they carry acids and things too um i don't know what the what the uh company plant is they went through i guess key personnel first and then it funneled down to uh the general population but i wonder if yeah and i- i still haven't been called yet in fact yeah in fact out of our office staff is let's see there's uh four six there's seven of us and there's only one been called oh oh i- i sh[ould]- probably shouldn't be talking to you then right okay and then you just got lucky again right yeah yeah i used to smoke years ago but i don't now well it's not only that but i've read different articles and they said even the even the best of labs they come back with erroneous samples and even if they get a a reading i guess they test the same sample again and they're going to get the same reading suppose they uh you know it's a do they crucify you right then and there or do they do they go back and retest but they retest the same sample oh i see oh okay but if they do then you're you're pretty well condemned right to be retested yeah yeah but i often won[dered]- wondered about that too yeah do you know of any incidences of of of uh erroneous you know something the[y]- they make a mistake the lab made a mistake and it really wasn't nothing oh just to see j[ust]- just to check on a lab uh we must be yeah we must be doing the same up here too we we're probably send to a different lab than you guys down there oh oh yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well how do you use your credit cards yeah um-hum yeah especially what i do yeah ridiculously high um-hum well so yeah plus a lot more yeah we[ll]- yeah for so many years i was so deep in debt on credit cards and i finally dug my way out of them_1 and that was enough to teach me you know you just i can do without them_1 yeah i got rid of a lot of them_1 especially the ones where i paid fees uh i kept the ones that were free and basically the same thing i use them_1 if i'm running short of cash and there's something i want or sa[le]- a sale or when i travel i use them_1 yeah yeah yeah it's about yeah that's what i do yeah if there's running into a cash short or something there's some things some purchases i make that i will do always on credit card just so i have a record of them_1 just like when i take all my cats down to the vet i always pay that on credit card yeah hum-um yeah yeah yeah yeah i yeah you're you're already approved then it's back i uh for the longest time i i'd gotten rid of my gas credit cards and then all of a sudden i started getting a flurry of these things so i- i did i have picked up three gas credit cards in the last couple months but uh yeah oh do you yeah oh you should have used it you wouldn't have been liable for the payment yeah they yeah they send you card th[at]- that you didn't apply for it's yours yeah of course they could always stick something in the credit bureau sure yeah i had a i had a tough battle with Exxon several years ago uh and i- i tore up their card and sent it to them and now i've got another one oh really what do you got out there Mobils yeah yeah yeah well i don't think i don't think we've got a Citgo here in Raleigh no matter of fact i know we don't um we have several convenience stores that sell Citgo gas but they're not Citgo stations i guess the biggies around here are Exxon Texaco and um well gosh that's about it BP i guess gosh i haven't seen a Sinclair station in years yeah gosh there used to when i was a when i was a kid there was a Sinclair station about three blocks away that's where i used to go to pump up my tires and get my flats fixed and all of that yeah just barely i guess well jus[t]- no uh i i've nope i've never had that i- i did have a problem with American Express one time about_1 ten years ago when i first got started in a business um they got my name of course and i said yeah this will be handy because i can use this for all my business expenses so i used it went on a went on a trip and used it got the bill and paid it about three weeks later i get this nasty letter from them_1 saying you haven't paid you're overdue pay it so i ignored it assuming that the things had crossed in the mail about two weeks after that i get a phone call say you are really overdue you need to pay this thing and i said what are you talking about i've already paid you and by that time the bank statement had come in and i had the canceled check so they said okay we'll take care of it two weeks later i get another nasty letter threatening legal action so i sent them a letter with a copy of the canceled check and their card cut up into about a hundred pieces i said here is your card here is the copy of my canceled check never send me anything else and never heard from them_1 but i just yeah i just you know i ain't got time to me[ss]- mess around with them too many people want my money out there i don't have to pay somebody to take it no i don't i- i kept wa[nting]- i kept thinking about getting it but i just don't use the things enough to justify getting it um-hum that's right tha[t's]- that's right you're paying you're paying a higher interest rate so they can rebate you two percent of it um-hum hum that's right right and in the meantime for that entire year they've got the use of that money uh yeah it's oh it is i there's so well uh America's Americans are suckers they don't know how to sit there and look at the interest rate and say well this one is only sixteen percent and this one's twenty two hum yeah i yeah right that's i've only got i've only got two uh two cards now i've got a Bank of Scotland Visa and a Citibank MasterCard and and that's it i mean i- i don't need anything else now um-hum yeah yeah yeah so[mething]- something like that my roommate really believes in American Express he's got the green car[d]- or the gold card and the the Optima card and he just he just thinks they're terrific and i sit there and say yeah look what you pay for that every year yeah gosh yeah i'm thinking myself really yeah you know he's he's impressed because they send you this nice statement every i guess it's every year they itemize all your purchases and they break it down in little categories for you and all that uh yeah it's a nice report but is it worth you know is it worth sixty bucks a year for that don't be crazy uh when i was over in England i pi[cked]- i picked up that uh Bank of Scotland Visa card and i- i don't know har[dly]- i don't ever use it except when i want to play the currency market um that's that's when it becomes handy because if i know that you know if the if the uh if the pound is high i can buy more dollar things for what i'm getting and then if if i think the rate's going to drop then i pay them back in less dollars and it it's worked out most of the times i'm i'm usually pretty good on calling the the currency market yeah yeah i- i did it when i lived over there i did it quite often um and i rea[lly]- i really had a racket going because uh my paycheck was being uh electronically deposited here in the states and the bank that i banked with i could write them_1 a check on an American bank and they would give me instant credit for it so and and i and ov[er]- and over the course of a year i- i figured out how long it took them to clear that check and the and the shortest period of time was eight days so generally about eight days before payday depending on what the currency markets were doing i would go up and start buying i'd i'd start cashing in my checks for pounds and then by the time it th[e]- it the rate was either down or up depending on what i was doing and i[t]- it was great i mean i- i could yeah and i mean one day you know i might be able to get	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay well uh how do you feel about uh drug testing yeah yeah i am too a little bit i mean i- i don't want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing and and you know obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth but i don't really like having to do it it and i don't like the idea of it it's it's makes too much of a big brother type of thing yeah hum-um yeah yeah i think so too but you know it's one of those things yeah plus i guess if they are in trouble enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time then the company has lost what they've put into that employee and their expertise or whatever yeah well do you think that um it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing or do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it well you know if if they have time enough they can stay off of it yeah yeah i think so too uh i know the the group i was in at the time this all came up they uh were quite vocal about it uh through electronic mail boy they just really let them_1 have it from one end to the other vehemently but uh it has quieted down but i don't think they probably feel any differently and some some of them_1 did quit the company true um-hum yeah i wouldn't like anything of that you know don't tell me what to do yeah yeah well i guess too if i thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem then that would be one thing but i think it's too minor and too you know in in the whole scope of things this isn't going to to have any real affect on what's going on on the street yeah well yes that yes i- i think that could be a big problem you know i would just be irate if they said it was i knew it wasn't you know that just really rub me the wrong way yeah yeah right no i guess the one that really got me too was that uh let's say your spouse is on a particular drug and you know what that is and then you end up with the same problem and you take their leftover medicine that's not allowed know that's that's totally uh-huh oh that's interesting well well i guess we've exhausted that one enjoyed talking to you good-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
how are things in your area in that respect um-hum i think we've all heard about the train load from New Jersey that couldn't find a place to dump or something um-hum until the garbage all rotted or something we uh our town is just five thousand people and i've been very discouraged by the local authorities dragging their heals about getting into a recycling program each politician who comes up from election promises that that's going to be real high on his list of priorities but it just doesn't seem to be working out that way uh one of our local city council members who happens to be a personal friend of ours made the statement the other day that there would always be landfills and we just sort of came unglued at that point because if that's their thinking then i think we're definitely in trouble here because there just cannot always be landfills uh my we have always saved aluminum just absolutely forever and uh i'm saving uh paper now and glass our biggest problem is that no one will take the paper it gets really difficult to find someone in fact now i'm donating it to a local church and by giving it to them they take it in mass and then our junk dealer gives them ten dollars just because they've they're a church and he writes it off as a donation but it's a real problem with with the paper to find that outlet for it after you've got it stacked up um-hum um-hum um-hum um um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum uh sure i know i know um um-hum right um-hum as far as well that's one way to force them to recycle is that if they bill them by the pound then they're going to save it and not not put it out to the trash uh it we are in an open rural community and we find more garbage on the roadsides when it starts costing people they simply take a bag and pitch pitch it into a ditch someplace uh my my biggest concern or one of my biggest concerns is is the tires what they're going to ever do with used tires my husband uh recently retired after thirty two years in a service station and of course originally it was no big deal you could get rid of them but now there's just simply no way to get rid of these things and you see more and more of that around about the country where people have have thrown a tire in the ditch or two tires in the ditch and will the will the EPA allow this um-hum um-hum um-hum uh-hum a lot of these things can be placed in your area because of the density in population and yet they would be just frightfully expensive to put in our area because of the scarcity of population um-hum um-hum um-hum right well he was at the point where if if the customer did not want to take the tire with them he charged them a dollar to dispose of them_1 and still there wasn't really a way to dispose of them this was just to sort of encourage them to take them_1 uh at one time uh not too long ago uh farmers could use uh tires to start a fire burning fence rows which of course was an air pollutant and they've put a stop to any open burning of any kind and they are fining people now i mean it used to be the law was and no one enforced it but they are enforcing it now and and i'm glad they are however one solution presents another problem well i would like certainly like to see this you know if this is true with this fellow in Atlanta it sounds wonderful um-hum hum um-hum um-hum um-hum well i you've certainly hit on the key to any of it whatever we're going to do there has to be a profit there doesn't there the fellow who recycles the paper and the plastic and the aluminum he's got to be able to make a profit or he just isn't going to do it um-hum um-hum it's costing us a lot more than money isn't it um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um um-hum um-hum we didn't throw away anything did we um-hum um-hum well we have to come to that now that's all there is to it you do see a lot of positive things uh i saw a printout sheet the other day that i'm going to to copy and take to the girls at

all right uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh really i think that i don't know i don['t]- i don't think our prison system isn't set up where we um rehabilitate or you know restore anybody i think it'll only make them worse but i i believe that God can come in and change a person's heart and genuinely change it but that doesn't negate that you do reap what you sow and if you do kill a person and it is you know you're found to be guilty i believe God establishes the authority of our court system and i believe that you know that i do believe that capital punishment is uh alternative even you know God can still change your heart but that doesn't mean like the alcoholic that charges up all the bills on the credit card or the {shopaholic} you know you get your life right with God but you still have to pay your Visa bill you still have to you know so but God sent us his grace and they give pardons but i believe if it's a genuine conversion there's a genuine and those prison people know they know a genuine turnaround in a person's character they see that and i i worked in a prison in Fort Worth yeah i have a degree in social work you see it you know the ones that have a genuine character change it is obvious and they know that they're they're not going to pardon someone from the governor you know what i'm saying they're not going to go without going through every channel of authority in the prison so i feel like you know that's is there is occasions where there are they do spare lives and you know i leave that with the governor who of course is going to go through every authority because they want to be be reelected so uh-huh punishment uh-huh no that's okay uh-huh uh-huh right but in in the Old Test[ament]- yeah right we don't well yeah we definitely have lost the Judeo-Christian ethic of the judicial system for sure but the ba[se]- the base is still there the foundation is still there though bu[t]- of the system but i know what you're saying uh but also they're under a law because we haven't been removed from the law we've just been taken out from under under a law because under the law if your child mo[cked]- back talked you he would be stoned yeah under the law he would be stoned so we've been removed from the law of un[der]- from being under the law but we're still you know we're still accountable to it we don't need to back talk but you know it's like God changes your heart to not do that he changes your heart not to look upon a woman in lust because in the Old Testament they could look all they wanted just couldn't do it but in the new he's looking at your heart and so i guess that's what what i mean by their character changes and you know what i mean it's like looking beyond what they're doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart what's the character showing me here and those and then any of if i don't think see if i don't believe that there's not a character change and the authorities agree that this person needs to be excused i believe for murder uh rape i even believe incest things that will permanently damage uh the character of the child i believe crimes against children should be punished bu[t]- by by death i believe sexual crimes unless there's a true change of character and that's where we just have to to trust the authorities and they're not going to excuse people if it was was run like that i don't there would probably be very few exceptions to that and if it was done quickly and done swiftly and but it's not because the judicial system has rejected they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have pretty much right uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah yeah uh-huh uh-hum yeah yeah anybody yeah yeah right i know in Jamaica uh it think it's Jamaica i think it's Jamaica i know that they have you know crimes punishable by death and i'm sure they hit a few every now and then and i wouldn't want to be one of them that are not guilty but i know that they have like uh their crime rate it's not Jamaica i don't think i can't remember which it's uh one of the Caribbean Islands and and they Singapore is it like that my husband's going Singapore and they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law and the law is enforced and that's what wh[at]- when you have lawlessness i mean the law's not being enforced and all that does is lawlessness we were we went on a mission trip to Manhattan and to the Bronx and stuff two years ago and all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack and everyone was out uh we were across from that big bus station i forget what you call it but anyway and everyone they had like fifteen people lined up on the fence and within two hours there were fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing and you'd see the same kid who were back out there in two days because there's no the answer is not being given to them in the court system and i think initially when our country was set up it was set up with God and it was really an integral part and no you can't you can't force people but i think people are hurting and they're out doing crack sitting on the street they were the kind of people that i think mostly we would want to receive it if it was presented to see i don't know i guess i'm kind of frustrated that you know we've gotten away from the Christian basis that our court system was founded upon i mean it reeks of the Bible just the whole thing the whole system and so i feel like if that was presented more openly and not just relying upon and para church ministry to come in and do it but that the system itself you know you know what i mean i feel like that might be better if it was run on a more scriptural basis which would include you know you know and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with right right yeah yeah right right yeah i know you're right they would lobby that and and i see that and that's why you know i'm like okay what's my role in this thing you know what's my part because i don't think the system is going to get fixed i think it's crippled	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

so i own uh a PCAT at my home well that's actually a good question my wife works out of the home uh our home she has an office and it si[ts]- actually sits in the office and she uses it to compose and print out letters so that's a a very regular use of it that she has and then in addition to that i tinker around with it i'm a computer scientist and so i write programs to do little things i'm actually working on a data base at home just just to keep track of things nothing special and also i'm interested in writing some programs that will you know kind of like remind me of things uh like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like although hum-um um-hum um-hum oh that's a key thing well actually there['s]- that's a there's really two issues to that that there's so many pa[ckages]- software packages available today that just require no programming so that y[ou]- you in other words when someone built that software package they had to use the programming but if they were careful they could uh make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works but i think y[ou]- you you really hit the nail on the head for the average person is exactly what he can use it for and if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending out letters or if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage or whatever there your issue is then there really is oh i see wow i see well on yeah well actually uh one other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap that um-hum right oh the calculators you mean yeah uh-huh yeah they sure do yeah i actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum you can actually buy a wh[ole]- a whole brand new computer with a not not a uh necessarily a slow one or or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars no hm th[at]- well a[ctually]- actually i wasn't including a printer but y[ou]- you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars so make it seven hundred yeah yes uh-huh um-hum yeah the prices have plummeted you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply the box and the mother board of a a type of computer called an 8088 for about two hundred dollars and then the keyboard is another fifty the monitor with the card that drives it is another hundred and then the disk drive is two fifty and well that's the that's the deal is you're not buying brands now you're buying these knock offs so there's uh probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one there's there's a magazine called Computer Shopper it's a it's a big magazine i mean it's it's twelve inches acro[ss]- uh narrow the narrow side and and fif[teen]- fi[fteen]- seventeen inches the tall side and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages but the book is the magazine is full of these mail order computer mail order houses and they're all competing with each so you just flip through there until you find a 8088 computer that['s]- that's called that's the original PC so it's be called a TI P[C]- i'm sorry an IBM PC compatible and you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors for forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the b[oard]- board for twenty five dollars which is amazing to me and just you mix and match and then you do it by mail order but there's no real brands there's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards the main computer the circuit board they're available in you know the B Daltons that that type of thing you'll notice it in that it's it's a it's a v[ery]- it's although it's a magazine it's large and like i said it's about an inch thick that's right that's great oh yeah yeah that's great yeah i understand that's great that's a good joke w[ell]- wh[at]- i did for years and then i was was a scientist over in central research labs and just recently i've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing so i now i i type that one but i don't use it anymore i don't um-hum yes um-hum yes i agree oh yeah oh i see that's fascinating um-hum yeah um-hum right yes yeah they certainly are so let's see so i guess with respect to the question yeah i i guess we've we've kind of covered it great nice little conversation with you Jack goo[d]- good day thank you goo[d]- same to you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

they do all right how do you feel about it um-hum are all employees s[ubject]- s[ubject]- uh subject to it or just a certain new employees yeah what about random testing what what type of industry is it Wayne electrical okay sure so uh i've i've never been involved in a company that had the drug testing but have been involved in companies that have discussed it one of them very very hazardous type of uh operation drilling oil and gas wells and there's enough problem with injuries in that area anyway uh without contributing to it through drugs or alcohol and you know it it was encouraged it's just a matter of a lot of businesses today i don't believe know how to implement a drug program uh how to really really have a good one whether it's preemployment or ongoing either one um-hum eventually have everyone yeah it at least run a spot check and i think maybe the knowledge that they could have random testing uh may have an effect too um-hum yeah i personally don't it's easy to see in some industries you know you don't want uh bus drivers or or pilots to be under the influence of drugs and it's easy to see that type but it can effect uh almost every every office um-hum right and are if you're government contractor you probably fall under some type of government supervision on it uh um-hum yeah did uh was there much objection to it prior to implementation or um-hum which is wh[ich]- and people are confused uh i think too by what is a test you we all know about the uh Olympics and the testing there and how some of them can be wrong and uh i- i think they're afraid of appropriate prescription medication showing up some of them are some of the innocent ones are and they i think they can and uh i think a lot of it uh that's that's why the type of type of test is important and we we tend not to know uh we tend to think theoretically but lots of times getting down to the actual method and and results uh being evaluated properly is where we have a short fall where are you located Wayne in Virginia okay uh North Carolina but i've been in in uh Oklahoma for about twenty years so just got kind of got back to this part of this country originally from Virginia oh okay yeah pretty pretty time of the year up there now isn't it uh the uh Cherry Blossom Festival apparently went all right did you oh yes do you get to the Smithsonian but oh good good but i think that's one of the areas uh i've found several areas in the government that i really enjoy seeing money spent and the Smithsonian complex is one of them i think it's great to go through there and see kids of all all sizes and ages going through those buildings there um-hum and it'll be a great memory for her later too i think well the uh time limit i think is is about up but i enjoyed talking to you Wayne all right thank you bye	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay um i probably use my Discover card more than anything else uh no i really don't use too many credit cards i'm not fond of them i don't like using them but i've just gotten to the point where i'd rather carry that instead of cash but but the thing is i always carry it with my checkbook so if i have i just pay for it with my check instead of i think i've only ever used my credit card maybe three or four times um-hum um-hum um-hum oh yeah wow um-hum um-hum yeah uh-huh yeah with only only certain cards they accept though they don't accept all kinds of cards like they only accept the major cards um i don't know they do accept the Discover but i know they would accept like Visa Master Card um-hum oh my um-hum um-hum exactly exactly uh-huh exact[ly]- yeah uh y[es]- yes definitely that see that if if i don't have the money in my checking account i will not charge it even if i have the charge i have to have that money before i'll charge it i refuse well i'm a college student and i'm a finance major so i just and um i don't i oh my gosh i prob[ably]- i have a Discover card i have an AT&T card but i don't use it b[ecause]- i don't even know where it is i put it away like two years ago because_1 i thought if i don't see it i won't use it which is really good because_1 then i you know a lot of my friends have like outrageous phone bills but i don't have it because i don't use mine and um i know i have Montgomery Ward's i have a um a J C Penney's i have a Kaufman's you know i have a Fashion Bug i have a whole bunch of them and i just used my J C Penney card and it's a year old and that was the first time i've ever used it yeah i just i don't think to use them all the time and if i do use one i would rather use my Discover card one and they're getting to the point now too at the end of the year all the money that you've you've charged on they'll pay you i think it's ten percent back so you know i even got a couple dollars back um-hum yeah exactly uh-huh uh-huh oh my gosh yeah me too that would definitely um-hum uh that's why i have it uh-huh um-hum no huh-uh no that that yeah and being a college student i get um applications for them all the time i think uh once a week i have an application and the first thing i check for is if there's an annual fee if there's an annual fee i ditch it because i don't use them that often so it wouldn't even pay me to get it even if it was you know and uh my Discover card i have no annual fee and my mom like i started using mine and i told my mom about it and now she buys everything with her Dis[cover]- Discover card and she works it the way you do with your card she writes it down like she would a check and then you know and that way she's getting the interest on it too because_1 then a[t]- at the end of the year they give her back her interest and i think she got back like fifty some dollars last year so i mean she might spend three thousand but if you get thirty of it back you know that's that's still thirty dollars less exactly and she you know my mom's like that too she pays it off as soon as the bill comes um-hum i haven't tried it i um-hum there's so there's so much fine print that i don't understand that i won't even try it yeah i just rely on my Mac card my Mac card just take it out of the uh-huh um-hum yeah um-hum um-hum yeah um-hum that's good um-hum yeah they usually i think they're usually pretty good about that uh i mean they they probably realized it was their mistake if if they really thought that it was not their mistake i think they would probably send you something proving that you actually did have it so yeah uh-huh i re[ally]- i'm i'm starting to use my credit card more like i said i'm a college student and the past two semesters i bought my books with it so and i run between two and three hundred dollars a semester with books so that's approximately between five and six hundred dollars that i put on it and i just keep thinking oh good i'm going to get that back i'm going to get a little bit back uh-huh um-hum i i can't see that and when they do that all they're doing is paying the interest on it they're not even paying the principal i- i uh uh whe[n]- uh when i get to people like that i wish i- i think the company should just say uh we're not giving you any more until you pay this off i mean i realize that the company wants you to use it you know and extend it all the time they're making more money off you but i think they should have the the consumer the most interest you know it's like they're addicted to using their credit card or something um-hum oh my God i can't i- i can't do that i have like i said i have to i kn[ow]- have to know that i have that money before i'll spend it so i- i- i don't i don't know of course my mom lives very she was she had twelve kids and of course she she watched her money all the time and i that was one good thing i did get off of her uh i don't mind spending my money as long as it's a necessity and if it's something i really really want but just to go out and start buying i'm not like that and that's something i got off of her and i'm	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

when i'm driving to work i listen to a radio station which is twenty four hour news and that's how i get most of my stuff that gives me about uh thirty minutes thirty five minutes each way each day so that's about an hour and hour and ten minutes worth of uh KRLD yeah yeah uh i don't usually watch the news at night time because_1 uh i'm you know just got home ready for dinner and and all that and by the time i get done with dinner it's already over and pretty much yeah because_1 they have the uh CBS uh world news o[n]- on the hour on the radio so i get all of that stuff then plus i get all the local news uh what do you think i don't know that's pretty strange yeah you know i mean uh w[ith]- wi[th]- like with regard to the Soviet Union we're telling the uh Soviets you know hey the Baltic States wanna separate go ahead and let us separate that'll be good you know wh[at]- what if the American south wanted to separate like they tried to do in eighteen sixties would we be so forgiving and say ah sure go ahead form your own country you know i mean seems kind of hy[pocritical]- hypocritical of us to to be telling other countries to like go ahead and let part of their country separate off you know and Gorbachev he's the one who wants to keep his country together which i can understand you know and the other countries that wanna separate they wanna get away from all that garbage the Soviet Union i don't blame them either it's not something that's something that they got to work out for themselves we shouldn't be involved in that we shouldn't even be talking about it you know the government should just stay away from them people and just let them figure out for themselves what they need to do yeah Bush should not do anything but as a[s]- as for the rest of but though i don't you know we get the paper on the weekend and i'll i'll flip through that you know once or twice but not wo[n't]- won't read it cover to cover and uh yeah i do that all everyday so that's another way but that's mainly you know that doesn't have like a whole lot just a few things on there which is huh i didn't see it is that right is that up wow should've sold the building i was in we[ll]- i[t]- guess you work for TI too i guess you work for TI too oh yeah you got {surplused} i g[ot]- i got {surplused} last year myself yeah another organization yeah th[ey]- they needed somebody just like me whereas before i was not even doing what i was supposed been doing but uh that's not that's not the topic i guess but uh yeah it did quite a bit better yeah oh gosh yeah yeah it's gonna be a tough time f[or]- all around the country i mean you look at the look in the paper and you see all the stuff about you know layoffs here layoffs there and you think oh man what's gonna happen you know thank goodness General Dynamics got that big contract because_1 that'll least bring some money to the area General Dynamics and Lockheed and Boeing Lockheed an[d]- Boeing on this yeah but Lockheed i used to work for Lockheed and at the time i was there they were developing the prototype for the uh that fighter and so it was pretty big stuff there then now they got the contract for it so well they're they're in in partnership with uh Lockheed an[d]- and Boeing yeah it's a it's a threesome no McDonnell Douglas lost out they lost the contract they were in partnership with Northrop and they lost the contract and so yeah probably sell to somebody who wants to pay yeah there you go old Jerry can use that yes have a good day bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay do you exercise every night or not do you yeah i i'm on uh a right now i'm on one of those jags where i- i exercise at well i- i run every night and uh i just i was surprised i could run i didn't think i could i thought well i maybe a half a block i can run but i have really amazed myself but what i do i walk oh about a half a mile and i walk uphill and then i run all the way back down by the time i get down to my street i've worked up a pretty good momentum and i can just keep right on running until i get home and uh i'm not right now i just got through doing it so i'm a little bit out of breath i'm really not as winded as i would thought thought i was going to be yes i think gosh i just got b[ack]- got in from running and i thought well i'll place this call real quick but i have a little dog i run with so i'm and she's getting old i don't know if i probably not good for her but it's good for me yeah i think so oh do you yeah aren't they pretty i not uh-huh is it a pointer or setter yeah i think they're the prettiest i had a a Greyhound i was race i was running with but uh he was i fou[nd]- i just i tried uh i finally had to give her back to the Greyhound Association she was just too big for me she she weighed seventy pounds and uh if she would run with me you know and stay with me but if she saw something she wanted if she wanted to get away she could have she would have drug me i mean when i walked with her people you know would laugh because she drug me when i tried to walk and when i tried to run i was afraid she'd really take out running and just have and they can run i think uh forty miles an hour and uh gosh uh she got away from me a couple of times and so i'd rather run with a little Pekingese any old day they're my my more my style yeah yeah i'm i'm too chicken to get out any place else no oh have you yeah oh okay well that might be my i have a walking tape i use i bought me a little head set you know and a little walking tape which really helps but but i wanted to run for some reason and you know and i- i didn't really think i could because_1 i- i remember years ago when i tried my side would hurt real bad and everything but i i'm on a health kick i've decided uh my cholesterol was high and my triglyceride's high so i've i've uh done that and i'm on uh i everybody says i don't need to lose weight but i feel i must so i'm going to try to lose ten pounds and i've lost four of it so i'm really yeah and i do it every night except for i- i do volunteer work at the hospital one night a week so i don't do it that night but the other uh six days a week i run no just my dog i had a neighbor across the street that was going with me but she can't run because she said her ankles hurt or her knees or something and so i uh what i do i'll walk with her up the top hill and let her take my dog and then i run home if she's home she's a flight attendant so she's not home very often and so when she's home i run with her but her walk with her but i would if i didn't have this radio on my head i- i think i in fact i haven't been using my walking tape since i've been running i've been using just my radio and if i didn't have that to go but i have to what i do is i have to set goals for myself i say okay i'm going to make it to the end of that block and then when i get there i'm going okay i've got to make i just go a block at a time if i didn't i- i- i don't think i could make it and i need feel that running you know three and four mile i don't think i could do it i co[uld]- you know i a mile is real and it may not even be a mile i'm running it feels it looks like a mile to me but it may not be yeah i think i think i will this weekend i but i'm almost afraid to i'm afraid that it's oh all this for nothing you know i could go a little bit further but i just don't you know golly i'm not a spring chicken any more and i don't want to have to my daughter got after me she said now you are taking identification with you and i said no i'm just in the neighborhood she says well mother what if a car should jump the the road and hit you or what if you stumbled and fell and knocked yourself out and they wouldn't know who you were i said well she is smart you know oh yeah um-hum yeah i realized she was right after that so now i uh i carry a little ID with me that shows who i where i live anyway and i put my daughter's telephone number for emergencies so oh i do too and i go religiously for a check up every year and uh my triglycerides were three hundred and sixty five now this what makes me mad i'm i- i don't eat beef i don't use salt i watch my diet all the time and i uh it was three sixty five it's supposed to be a hundred and fifty my cholesterol was two hundred and thirty five well i've gotten that down to a hundred and ninety and my triglycerides have come down to two seventy three but they told me that it takes about three months for triglycerides to come down so it's coming down and and i think this and exercise and really watching your diet does it i've been on that diet that what's that Tommy Lasorda thing uh diet ultra fast ultra slim ultra yeah slim fast that's it i've been doing that and it's not too bad uh i don't need huh no but i'll tell you what i'm doing i'm doing the uh omega fish fish oil calcium leci[thin]- lecithin uh vitamin B6 no but i'll that's my next step i'm uh-huh did it well they they say that the nurse at works said the uh the fish oil would uh would bring it down and the lecithin is supposed to bring your cholesterol down so and my doctor really was more concerned with uh my triglycerides but he said well my God Nancy no wonder you you have high trigly[cerides]- look how look how your weight's jumped and it jumped seven pounds in one year i think you'd think i was i'm a a a size eight i said that's not fat i know you know logically that is not fat but i do realize i need to to lose some weight but oh i do too absolutely and i feel so much better about myself when i you know get into good shape when i lived in Orlando i went to weight watchers and i- i went from a size twelve to a size six in three months no i'm not real sporty years ago i used to play tennis but i'm so bad i ended up you know just chasing the ball all the time i'd like to do tennis again but uh well that's good exercise do you exercise uh do you play tennis very often oh do you now see i'll quit running when it gets warm when it gets hot i know there's no way i'll get out in that heat and run or even walk i'll probably balloon up yeah it'll it'll have to be well you know i know but then you have to go to work all uh i shower at night but i- i may just have to change my schedule yeah early in the morning about five in the morning five thirty in the morning when it first gets isn't yeah that's what i'll have to do and i'm really scared to go out at night after dark i not in this day and time and you know when i grew up it was different but nowadays y[ou]- i wouldn't i i'm not foolish enough to do that yeah yes she doesn't like me on the telephone she's so jealous so well it's been nice talking to you and uh you too bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well how would you rate it um-hum yeah yeah that's true yeah th[at]- that's true i'm i'm kind of like you you know i do[n't]- i'm kind of in between but i i'd rather not rate it at all because i think it's very site specific yeah right it doesn't make sense if if you can govern yourself yeah well i think you know it's like you're saying is you know w[ere]- in in places in communities where hunting is common yeah you can't ban guns there it's not it's kind of impossible it's a way of life for people but uh in in cities i think there there may be a possibility for certain law restricting firearms in certain areas maybe not the ownership of such but it's restricting the you know the the uh presence of of hand guns in certain areas no that's what i'm saying like not have one in the city like you can have one but you can't have one in your apartment if it's you know cause you're in the city like you may have it at a summer home or somewhere else yeah just because you live in the city doesn't mean you can't have it but you just can't have it in the city well yeah well you know i see i don't know the statistics for that for you know how if if by having a gun how much that really helps so i don't really know that's why i think that maybe if not maybe not just having one will be better that's that's why i i wouldn't know because i'm not from the city so i don't i don't see the very high crime rate you on the other hand may have a different opinion right right exactly as you know as i'm i'm from uh you know rural so i i go hunting a lot uh-huh no yeah the bad things is that you know when you try to make it harder for criminals to get them how do you know if you're selling to a criminal or not yeah yeah i mean you can['t]- you can't ever really determine that i mean you can sell it to a straight person and and then he becomes a truant yeah yeah that's like shit more for some kind of control huh yeah well i don't want to see it but it sounds good to them yeah well i think you know maybe some kind of con[dition]- some kind i think they should ban uh automatic weapons for you know only only and restrict them to uh gun clubs only i don't know if they've they've completed that action or not right and well uh i mean that doesn't really matter imported or or you know domestic machine guns they still do the same damage i don't see i don't see what the difference is myself you know getting shot by i mean in a gun club or something you know in a gun club or or have the wrong reason in mind those two are the that's why i think that maybe you know you if you say you can't have an automatic weapon that's that's also saying that you can't have a gun so if you say you can have it but you have to be a member of gun club that that restricts it even further doesn't doesn't take away your right it just puts a restriction on your right but i do[n't]- you know i think i think restrictions are going to be needed but no no bans or anything like that it's kind of hard though because in different reg[ions]- different regions like you were saying is uh is different like there where you're at you wouldn't mind having a gun so you you're really you know yeah right it's a good deterrent yeah well total ban is one and uh no ban at all is ten yeah i think i think well around seven or eight restricting certain kinds and and leaving others out with restrictions but i don't know what that you know like you were saying the uh the seven day restriction or seven day wait period or something like that what does that mean that that really doesn't you know it's just because it gives them time to look you up doesn't mean i mean it it it may be well intended but i don't know how effective it is yeah that's true so then it's it's uh up to the the individual dealer yeah but what does does the uh does the retailer have the opportunity to you know disregard that information that he receives because you know if if it's if it's not against the law for the retailer to disregard that information that kind of defeats the whole purpose of the seven day wait period national right oh well man i guess that's about five minutes all right nice talking to you Ra[lph]- Ralph

sure i used to cycle around the block two or yeah i recycled once before no yes actually we do we have Berkeley is a very avant-garde recycling city yeah they they go around and they give you these boxes and you you fill these boxes up and you take them_1 out and they leave you know uh you leave them on the curbstone and every Thursday or some such day they come by and pick them up problem is you end up with these boxes in your home that you know get pretty piled up with such things as glass and tin cans and newspapers and and and by the time you you manage to drag one downstairs you know it's it's work i- i- i just th[e]- th[e]- there there's got to be a better way of incorporating it you know somehow so that the manufacturers uh uh that there's an incentive to get it back to them exactly you know wha[t]- what they uh oh another thing is that it th[e]- industry has got to get the mind set that what they'd do affects the uni[verse]- you know th[e]- affects the environment what they manufacture has got to be and the way it's packaged has got to take that into consideration but like here in Berkeley you can't buy anything from a fast-food place anything like that that's in styrofoam uh and you know it's it's supposedly i've heard some stories though that uh the thing that that lasts longest in in in a in a the the uh landfills is not so much the diapers and the things that everyone's yelling about but it's the newspapers yeah and that's really strange you wouldn't think that but whenever you see you know they're usually uh wrapped real tight and bundled and under pressure themselves before they get put into the landfill so inner areas of them are are protected so they don't decompose isn't that you know you and all those thousands of trees that gets cut down and you think well geez well newspaper's pretty good because it will you know indeed well you know there's got to be a fortune in that you know i've got all we've got to do is get together and figure out some way to to use these diapers in some useful product you know some some some well yeah yeah or or or or a compost brick uh you know you know build your next sky rise out of compost brick you know you'd see the little blue things flickering through it but i think that might give it a little added touch of something i'm not sure what no but that so they're aware of it in Texas huh that makes my heart sore because the last time i was in Texas was on a hunting trip and i was there with a couple of buddies and we had filled up a couple of cans we're going down the road about eighty miles an hour and rolled down the window and just threw them out now uh i- i will have to say that the people i was there with were Texans i was visiting it was not my idea well i- i understand that and i think that that that he's certainly contributed to that i want you to know you've taken a big load off my chest i've never been able to to confess that to anyone and now i've gotten to confess it well something's got to be done i tell you what i was just watching a a show the other night on on Antarctica uh and how they're wanting to make it a a uh an international park zone so that no one country you know gets down there and trashes it for mining rights or any other thing and um uh it just it just amazes me uh you know that that that there's so little left on this earth where there is that sort of thing and of course the only reason that that place is left is because the damn climate is so inhospitable that no one can live down there you know yeah well they're they're doing it they you know they're they're learning and and it's inevitably doomed and spe[ck]- you know all they got to do is find one speck of platinum or one speck of gold or uranium and and well they not uh not absolutely for sure now there is some off offshore but as far as on the continent i don't think that anyone drilled a rig on the continent yet but uh in any event i think we all just sort of have to hunker down and do something about it but you know it's like we we we have all the needs that you know a civilized society has and i think that it's not all our responsibility to to do that i mean th[e]- the the manufacturers wou[ld]- would manufacture things in ways that were biodegradable and did not damage the the the environment you know i think that it would be a plus for them and more people would buy more of those products yeah and i think that the people are ready to pay a little extra for that kind of marketing yeah yeah well i- i know i'm willing i just uh you know it's just i- i have certain needs for certain things and uh you know i really can't help it how it is packaged i have the need for what's there found ways and i will switch immediately and i think probably the rest of the planet will too well listen it's been a pleasure talking with you Steve right alright well you take care and listen uh the next time you run over a beer can in the road please do alright

actually i'm real close to being in the market to buy a car i've got uh a couple older cars they're both over ten years old and uh they've served me well but i kind of would like to get a more uh gas efficient car and a newer model something looks a little nicer uh i've got three children at home two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old and so i need to make sure i've got one that i can fit all five of us into and if you if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time well uh i've kind of been leaning towards a Caravan uh now i know that that uh they've gotten quite pricey in the last couple of years but uh i like the Dodge products and uh been uh couple times i've had a opportunity to rent one uh i've been really pleased with its performance and with the size and because if you get the seven passenger version you can put some space between the kids and uh i think that would that would serve us well plus it's got uh good storage capacity in it for you know taking things along going to the store um-hum exactly correct yeah if you want yes yeah it uh the Dodge Caravans will do that uh you can take the uh uh usually there's a uh a double seat behind the uh front buckets and then if you get the and then there's a three seat that goes or three person seat that goes in the back now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out and just have the three seats in the back and the two seats up front or you can take the uh three seat out and just use the two seat or you can take the two seat and move the two seat to the back so it's very versatile you can move the seats all around that's the only thing you can't do is take that three person across seat and move it forward uh-huh uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah i think that's getting to be kind of important now that uh you know the price is becoming the driving factor and then you look at once you realize how much money you've got to spend then you start looking around at at what you can buy with it where before i think you you looked at the car you wanted and then you looked to see how well you could afford it or how you could afford it yeah yeah i know they're trying to do everything they can to uh end the recession and dropping the prime is probably one of the things i just bought a new house so i got a a uh nine and a half percent interest rate not sure i could do much better today but uh that is also effecting buying a new car well that and the[re]- uh two fourteen year olds will be uh fifteen on the fourth of July so yeah they're twins born on the bicentennial you're going to have twins have them on the bicentennial is our motto July fourth seventy six so uh uh i've still got another full year and three months before they're going to be behind the wheel of a car so America's safe for another fifteen month and uh after that now i may keep the uh one or both of the two cars i i currently have for them to drive you know they're they're they're small enough that a first time driver could handle it yet big enough that i feel s[afe]- feel safe that if they were in an accident they would survive you know what i mean it i don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about the Honda they're just uh-huh is that right uh-huh right jeez well yes definitely the thing is that they're i think it's a two part seat belt though there's the uh door belt and then there's one a lap belt then make sure you smack him around then yeah yeah yeah the uh the supports um a good source of information i've found has always been these uh used car manuals because you can flip through the used car manuals and they'll give you a list of all the problems that the car's had in the past and you can look at the uh the track record on a car over the year and you usually notice uh a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out to where there's fewer problems and you get an idea on how well the the next car's going to be now as long as they aren't changing the model you know like when the uh Pontiac Grand Prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems with the smaller car as long as they aren't uh-huh yeah sure uh-huh yeah i remember when that happened so unless they're really changing the model um yeah chances are that it's probably going to have the the fewer mistakes than it had the year before uh-huh yeah yeah i agree uh-huh ye[ah]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

{alrighty} i think one of the most significant changes that have happened is that they've changed from homemaker to the work market and for several reasons probably some of that is divorce and some is they're more educated than they used to be i think um i think sometimes uh leaders in government they've become more uh adroit in that area too instead of just men all the time have more women in government and now i'll let you say something very limited uh-huh yes um-hum um-hum right i think that's right um-hum right i really think women have so much more responsibility than you know as far as everything and like you said um one women today have so many uh the average today of having a a single family you know with the mother as the head is just really um so commonplace nowadays uh-huh right right um-hum you know isn't that funny uh because the same thing happened to us except i was twelve and my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession and was isn't that funny uh but just that they were able to do it you know and even today i think the chance for education is is so much uh better for all of our girls and and boys too but but the girls especially a lot of things yeah right yeah and i also think that in the future that uh it's gonna continue that we're not gonna see a lax off of women in the work force i think they're going to stay there and i think that they're gonna uh be really responsible and and do everything just like what you said you know make make it the grade and and make it so women can be the top people in their in their field oh i think so right right exactly exactly that's right and i think that is happening more and more i think it's just gonna take a little bit longer well great okay good to talk to you Sally thanks bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay hi Norma have you uh taken anything back lately uh that you've bought well why very good good well wh[at]- do you think that uh consumer goods goods are generally getting better or worse in quality i do too i believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time but i don't i- i believe that they're better now than they were however i didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixty three thousand miles on it and i don't like it very well if when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out at uh on one side no i had moved away i had taken the first one back i didn't think that it heated well enough it never did get anything but just moderately warm took it back and um the people told me well that's the way it's supposed to be and i fell for it and uh when i got this one it did a litt[le]- it heated a little bit warmer and then after one year it started heating only on one side also i took an iron back after having it only one year now i figure th[at]- uh anybody that is dumb enough to iron needs to have an iron that will last a long time and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last well without even any question but i think it was the store Wal-Mart yes and uh w[ell]- well have you been buying any clothes lately any new clothes that was poor quality i think i wondered if it weren't expensive and they should have put buttons on it that would last forever yes the d[o]- you spend that much on your dresses you're really divulging very personal information oh of course i do too well i believe that we've been talking about five minutes and Norma it is just wonderful to talk to you you are a good one to talk about consumer goods because you keep up on it all the time bye-bye	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
uh yeah they've sort of left a bad taste in my mouth too i've been sort of irresponsible a couple of years ago and i'm still paying for the the my own stupidity uh-huh oh you're uh-huh if the other person doesn't yeah oh i'd i'd say so and isn't it now on those those cards was it um mostly her that that ran up the bills yeah twenty thousand wholly smokes yeah that's got to be like close to what a thousand bucks a month uh-huh right yeah you might be worth your while to run one of them thirty dollar uh credit checks just to find out what it says yeah i need to find i need my credit card mostly for uh just government travel you know um uh program manager for the Air Force and uh i uh i have to go on uh travel quite a bit to contractors facilities and when i do i have to have the hotel and all that kind of stuff but i've been trying to curtail my use of it to to nothing e[xcept]- with the exception of uh of them those type things yeah no i'm not uh-huh yeah oh gee right sounds like it so the the credit card was inactive when you right right oh my gosh yeah guess the the bottom line is uh you got to be darn sure you're marrying the right person when you when you do that but uh i guess a divorce in any circumstance doesn't normally they're sir yeah that's for sure i know i happen to know of a different guy who um a girl i used to date her brother an[d]- h[is]- his wife ran up thousands of dollars in credit well i guess they're they are both responsible for the stupid things but um had a similar situation and then it was almost like he couldn't get a divorce because uh uh i guess she didn't even work or anything and then he would've been strapped with everything i i remember uh-huh yeah well i know i'm about uh thinking about doing a getting a consolidation loan just to lump everything together so that and it's down to one payment and then just get rid of all these old accounts and just work on a cash only system because uh i'm just i am ve[ry]- sort of irked at this at these credit card companies and you know they got you and right no no right right yeah yeah i remember uh was it two years ago or they did away with it last year right yeah uh-huh yeah well remember my refund on my income tax was a lot bigger uh two years ago than it was this year that's for sure right right i i can't even declare that here becau[se]- uh in my situation because it's uh uh not until i sell it the w[ay]- the way it works for me because i own it as jointly with my father and uh the they've changed those or it's a ends up getting classified as a rental property and it's not classified as a regular family dwelling so there's some reason we can't declare any mortgage interest um do you mean do we do i live in it or what what does that mean oh oh and well that would be an interesting situation because i'm a resident of Pennsylvania and uh because i'm in the Air Force and um i'm living here in New York so i ca[n]- i can't even vote here a property owner but i can't vote so yeah well that's only fair because the reason i'm a re[sident]- resident of Pennsylvania is because they don't charge military income tax so and so it's like Texas Texas doesn't either uh yeah or yeah uh-huh right huh sure well i don't know just getting back to the subject of credit cards i think the best uh thing maybe is that even though the American Express charges the annual fee is the American Express card is it makes you pay it every month yeah yeah i've got a Diner's Club through the government as well yeah they they force us to have yeah uh government Diner's Club and i had an American Express of my own i probably if i was smart i'd get rid of the American Express and get stop paying that annual fee on it but ooh yeah that that's not good yeah oh jeez really no right yeah it's like going oh i'll have that money by the end of the month and then end of the month comes around and you get your insurance bill comes and few other things and then you're like oh jeez yeah i know that feeling yeah oh well i'm getting to just about to that point myself so yeah really they've been oh really i haven't i- i we've actually haven't timed any of them i just kind of go into conversation ends on it's own or uh or that uh that they do come in with that so well anyway it was nice yeah it's nice talking to you Jerry and uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

no i don't my kids would love a pet i had a pet when i was a girl i had a Cocker Spaniel and i think one thing about pets is they're a lot of company you can you can tell them_1 anything and they won't tell anybody right as a matter of fact i was thinking that same thing unconditional love they just give it and don't expect too much anyway do you have a pet oh oh i'm so sorry but that's good that you're gonna get another one i know some of my friends who have pets uh and they just are really you know the ones who have dogs are very uh protective of them and i think that's one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets but they just um really take care of them_1 are and are protective of them yeah and and like my kids um they really want a dog badly and they've been looking and looking and want you know they'd take anything i think but um i don't know do you like i guess your cat was an indoor cat a kind of traveled traveled yeah when i had a Cocker Spaniel i[t]- it was an outdoor dog and uh i think i liked that better uh-huh yeah that's true yeah that's true take them_1 for walks right yeah i see all the people on on Sunday going for a walk with their dogs and and i i'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog i'm like i know it'll be fun the first week maybe and then mom gets to or something so i gue[ss]- um-hum oh that's exciting yeah yeah i think it's really important to that that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that you know we're not just going on with this pet population and having to just get rid of them that that kind of gripes on me some but but i don't know more and more people are aware right right but uh i think that's really true yeah yeah exactly exactly i think our community is a lot more conscious now though too and and that's good too well i think that's all i have to say okay have a good night all right bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
ready to talk okay uh i want to talk about um our family budget and the times that it's worked and the times that it hasn't worked and give you a general description of it and you can help me out a little bit tell me how yours work well at the my i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when i said that we are uh we're on the east coast now my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that well we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina and so naturally we put ourselves we looked at our budget and so what we did was draw up a budget that we thought uh was realistic and uh so we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do uh he wants to do that's satisfactory and we've been here seven months and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently so you see well we actually planned for about one year uh thank God because it never occurred it never occurred to us that it would take seven months and uh what we did was just uh decide wh[at]- how we had been spending our money before and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and uh and adjusted where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down and we really uh lessened it uh our living expenses uh more than what we thought we would but oh just our own design uh-huh and uh so but we've had budgets that didn't work when our uh you know of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing we spent too much money until our k[ids]- children went to college so so tell me about do you all uh have a budget wonder[ful]- yes three and a two year old bang bang um-hum well i think that's important for your budget to be realist[ically]- for it to work though you have to do something of course not well i found uh that in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents uh we we tended to want to keep on giving lavish gifts as we had done before and i really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down yes well i really do i think you have to budget those things though yes exactly or know so much per month anyway and uh that really should be in your b[ank]- but if you don't spend it it should be in your bank account at the end of the oh no no no no you don't want the government to spend your money you want to be able well uh but i do realize that that is realistic for some people and it was for us many year[s]- for many years uh and if and if that's the only way that will it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the the year then doggone it that's what you should do um-hum um-hum well i was just reading an article in uh a North Carolina pap[er]- paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at uh letters of applications to universities she was oh she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty so it can be done where there's a will where there's a will there's a way right well i have enjoyed talking to you oh i know uh we'll have to stay home and mow the yard bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
do you own a PC yeah oh good what are you taking in school hum oh it it's uh ideal for that word processing part is is extremely useful i think uh-huh an an P S E and i've been used to working and this is my first years but all of the work that i do is plus getting to know it a little bit better they're powerful little rascals uh yeah uh-huh yeah i'd i've noticed uh there was some scattered at work and i notice the uh through put is much faster on mine than than those but i think it's just because of the the lower level in expectation out of them that the processing speed is much faster on uh the same canned programs uh-huh yeah or performed to uh eighty percent expectation anyway yeah what was your first exposure to the computer uh-huh right is there an undergraduate requirement on them what about all the majors are there any such as business or uh or other undergraduate majors do they require it of any of them yeah well actually it's expanded your field too because the psychology of of man working with machine is is a whole new element that uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah it's interesting i think uh i've i've worked with computers since nineteen sixty yeah i'm an old man no they were the IBM six fifty took up a whole room as a vacuum tube uh machine and it was bi[nary]- quinary um base five i have no idea i didn't never did learn why but it was a base five which is very interesting oh it's been amazing it really has been oh i know it i know it and it's almost like talking about the checkless society and and all of that and you know there was talk in fact my brother uh was with IBM from nineteen fifty four until about three years ago so we really had a family history of talking about development of uh of equipment you know and i do i do some programming of my own too using Cobol rather than any of the newer languages it's just one that i've known for a long time and still use it even on this PS two so i have to learn a tolerance with canned programs because i'm so used to being able to do exactly what i want to do rather than having to work around or go through two or three different steps to get to the the final one but i am amazed at the power and uh ability of these small units that sit on a table or desk oh it it was almost uh well it's hard to describe but it's almost like uh an abacus versus an ele[ctronic]- electronic calculator you know y[ou]- you oh yeah but i mean the speed using punch cards and for your information Ken this first uh first computer had one had two accumulators and one focal point that you had to channel everything into it was called a distributor and you moved it from memory you had to know exactly where in memory it was there was no relative memory and you had to know exactly in memory where it was move it to the distributor put it into one of the accumulators and add it take it back out of the distributor and put it somewhere else so it it was as basic as you can get and uh of course the speed of processing was very very slow but compared to anything then it was very very fast yeah so it everything is relative twenty twenty years from now we'll we'll call up again and and say what do you think of the new uh thought computers right yeah but i think they're they're excellent tools for people to learn how to use and i'd like to see them in in grade schools right now i think they are in fact the computer system uh instruction yeah uh-huh uh-huh yeah oh yeah yeah but it has a lot of home uses too i've i've not i don't have mine hooked up to anything uh you know it's just a stand alone but the abilities in the future will be networking throughout uh automatic built-in telephone	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay that's probably a good idea all kinds of little like i said it's good that that if you visit at least four or five colleges before they even you know go to attend go down there and visit for the weekend they do have those programs where you can go down there uh well no uh actually uh my my daughter is quite yet but uh i went to a state school uh and i find that overall they're probably much cheaper and the quality of education's probably i would say is not much different than what'd you get at you know most of your like A&M Texas and uh you know Vanderbilt some of those i think there are some difference but probably in size in in in capacity of classes and that sort of thing but all in all the education level probably just as good if you if you participate yeah well i tell you what it it's expensive of course i worked my way through and uh i think that is a good idea in some cases except that now a days it's just so expensive well yeah it it it it can be cost prohibitive real quick you know i i wanna be able to at least i wanna pay my pay the tuition you know give her transportation if it's necessary and course i'd like her to live in the dorm if it's possible but i don't want her to have to work i i would i would i don't mind if she has a little part time job to earn just a little extra spending money that sort of thing and summer work and things like that unless she just tends to go all the way through but uh i don't want to to have her to feel financially you know burdened uh and not you know concentrate on studying and that sort of thing but uh i know like i guess probably one of the things that that i've i've learned is that to try and pick a college where they have at least three different degree plans that you would like as an alternative you start one you don't particularly like that one you have something to go through because_1 if you have to change colleges then you lose hours and then you have to go through all that uh preliminary uh applications yeah you know a lot of times you know people will go to a college when they get there they find out gosh i really don't like this at all and there's nothing there that they want other than that so they are faced with having to do all that and that can that can throw as much as a year out of your degree plan but uh that was one of the things that that i that i encountered uh so i i know so and then also the other thing is going to a j[unior]- to the junior college for at least two years to get all you preliminary courses your Math your English History Government all the things that that are time consuming uh and some of the course that you can take on television and get those out of the way before you even start a four year college because a lot of those course especially English and History well less expensive but not only that but a lot of those course they there're extremely difficult if you're starting out in a four year degree plan at a four year college they're extremely difficult and they go a little faster and and in junior college they go a little slower and you do learn you know a little bit more self paced and uh yeah well i think it's i think it's important that they do get away you know not necessarily so far that you can't get to them_1 but at least you know a hundred miles or or even two hundred miles where you can at least go down there on a on a like a month a one month basis or they can come home you know and it's not real expensive uh you know uh lot of times they can share rides coming back and forth if they you know have people in the local area that live near them but uh yeah you know none of did that we all stayed right close to home and of course i was married the whole time i was in school but uh but it was uh it was still one of those situations where mom and dad were still around if you needed them and uh you know not that i could really depend on them much but they were still there and you're not far enough uh-huh i know i guess probably one of the other things that i notice is that some of the colleges are very much uh encouraging you know the kids to participate in all the fraternities sororities and all the extra curricular activities much so because they they are money making things and they do support they do help support the school but i prefer colleges that don't stress that as the major focus uh i i'd rather them_1 go to the schools that focus on the on the academic part of it and that's a that's a that's a key now a days because_1 a lot of the college promote the partying and the and the sororities and things like that and and once you get hooked you know you can really get uh locked up in that stuff and your grades suffer they really do uh i got wrapped up in that of course i was in you know athletics and stuff like that but it got so time consuming it got to be to where i had to decide either i was gonna just quit all that mess and go study or or or you know just basically skin through uh well i quit i quit foot[ball]- i quit football because i just uh figured that it's not worth it what am i going to do with this after i get out i'm not gonna go pro football uh i'm not good enough i faced the you know faced that up front and say you know i'd rather get my grades and that's what i did i quit and went after after the grades no not at all so it uh but but you know you a lot of kids get hurt and then they they when they can't play pro ball anyway and then they don't have the education they should have what are they gonna do and that's that's a that's a big thing right now that you that you're seeing is the athletics the a lot of them are playing before they even can finish college they're playing pro ball i think it ought to be be a prerequisite that they ought to have a degree with a certain amount of grade point average before they are even eligible for pro ball but they don't they wont do that uh-huh yeah well i know i[t's]- it's getting down to it's getting down to grade school now i think they really need to get away from you know from stressing the athletics and extra curricular activities and get even at the young age get get the politics and the money out of the athletics and start getting back in the school uh-huh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay what kind of do you have children oh okay um-hum oh uh-huh and you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five right that uh-huh to learn something and that's i mean that's even not only toddlers but you know even your older children it's hard to find anywhere there really going to learn something and then yeah you do have to pay you know if you the better the place the more you're going to pay true very true if um-hum um-hum if i had any children i would uh i hope that i'll be in a position to stay home with my child because i'm not real uh uh trusting of a lot of people uh especially today people i work in the news business and i just see different things all the time and people are just crazy these days they're crazy and and i don't you know it takes me a takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend much less to you know trust someone with my with my child uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh um-hum hum i guess that's the best way you know to get recommendations from your friends or family members um-hum hum um-hum yeah yeah i mean you have to be you have to be sure that these people i mean not that they're going to abuse your child or anything but you just have to be sure that they're going to be watching them you know that they wouldn't let them drink something or you know eat something off the floor you know just simple things that can be harmful um-hum um-hum and you hear so much you know on the news about uh child care places and also um senior care facilities you know and you hear abuse yeah and so you just you just don't know and you almost want to you know spend a couple of weeks with in with your child just to see how it is or something but no i don't huh-uh no i'm uh no i'm only i'm twenty three so i still have a little bit of time um it's just not in the cards for me right now i'm trying to get my career going and uh yeah yeah um-hum um-hum uh-huh um-hum and you brought up a good point you know about learning you just don't want a babysitter you you would hope that maybe they'd come home and know some of their ABC's or something you know get them um-hum um-hum huh yes um-hum right um-hum right um-hum did you take this same uh route with your other two children okay um-hum i was wondering how um-hum um-hum right and it helps that he has older brothers um you know just to have role models and things like that um-hum um-hum hum um-hum that's excellent um-hum well what kid isn't these days so um-hum um-hum do they have any kind of program like at TI or wherever your wife works um some any kind of day care hum because_1 i know they're they're putting that into a lot of uh corporations now right so maybe that'll be an option for but then i- i foresee that being just a babysitting thing not much learning but you know kind of somebody to just watch your kid while your at work hum um-hum right um um-hum hum do you think it would have been better for him to have um maybe one continuous teacher somebody to that he could uh get attached to or is it better the other way with a lot of different uh-huh um-hum right hum right um um-hum right yeah each child is individual as for as learning and things um-hum right well it sounds good sounds like he's doing real well um-hum well good um-hum um-hum um-hum and they'll probably sit him in front of the television you know while they do other things yeah um-hum yeah well that's good that's good uh-huh uh-huh that's great right right that's probably what i'll try and look for whenever i do my children i don't know when that will be but um you know just really look into it will it will take me a long time to find somewhere i'm sure just because i- i just want to be i want to be so positive that you know my children are okay as well as the other children in the center you know um-hum um-hum exactly um-hum it's difficulties but it's it's a lot more difficulties these days because you have both parents working a lot of times and so you have to find day care whereas you know here um-hum um-hum um-hum that's right so child care's a necessity whereas years ago you know the husband basically worked and the wife basically stayed home um-hum um-hum um-hum right i think that has a lot to do with just just all children how they learn and things just because the basic family is is breaking you know the basic family is not there anymore um-hum i think that plays a big part in in a child's learning and you know what they can and cannot do in child care i would think	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay so um how do think how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years uh-huh really uh-huh well yeah really where'd you live up where'd you live at oh did you i'm from Illinois so how long how long you been in Dallas oh really yeah uh you know uh as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do oh yeah i agree yeah i- i definitely think that has gotten a lot worse and you know i i think there's to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values so but uh yeah yeah yeah th[ink]- i think there's more pressure like on both parents to work and things like that than there used to be and so but uh i don't know that's just that's one thing i see i see a lot more you know double income families and a lot more like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that i guess yeah that's for sure yeah without it hardly that's right yeah yeah just because they can't get into one yeah that's right yeah the way that like tax laws and stuff are structured you can't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways so yeah that's that's good point so i'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years oh yeah i agree well i hope so at some point but i don't know at what point yeah yeah it's uh yeah that's right do you work at T I do you what what uh department do you work in are you so i'm in semiconductor division too so how long you been with them since you moved down here uh-huh um i'm over at the Center One building are you really what floor i'm on the seventh floor how about that well it's a small world so so let's see second floor you work for uh Linear do you do you uh do you know Alec Morton huh well he comes up and pushes us around so uh so um so i'm pretty familiar with huh yeah yep you must know him his reputation precedes him yeah well uh he uh he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief they they say it's what makes him happy is to give us DADers grief so i can believe it but yeah let's see if you've been in Dallas eight years gue[ss]- i guess that's about how long i've i've been in here about eight years too i guess um been with T I like twelve but i started out in Lubbock and uh Lu[bbock]- Lubbock is i don't know i guess if this is the only place you've lived Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas but yeah yeah but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back too i mean here in Dallas everything is just real rush rush oh yeah well i got some friends that uh seems like he went to school at like DeVry is there a DeVry in Akron oh oh i see well he went to school somewhere in Ohio and he's from that area and uh he works over in the Park Park Central building i think but uh i haven't talked to him in a while but um yeah he he misses it he used to go back twice or three times a year you know because he missed it sounds like you haven't been back there in a while you still have relatives back there or oh really well let's see how how long are we supposed to talk here yeah well m[y]- my kids are probably needing me to go so all right well it's nice talking to you talk to you later bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
are you going to tell me what you've been doing lately in the okay oh my you uh you are experienced i would say well i agree i have d[one]- done something uh like that too only not n[early]- nearly as extensive but it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch style home uh after having a one that was historical looking yes uh-huh well maybe you can uh make that one charming and and make a little bit money uh yes well we just moved to Charlotte from Enid Oklahoma so i know of what you're talking about as far as the market was concerned and i'll tell you uh we we had kind of a charming house it was a cedar shake house and very weathered and uh it was about fifty years old but not tra[ditional]- not really uh traditional looking particularly and uh so i tried to make it after i sold my business i in in i spent almost three years redoing and i considered it a full time job and when we did uh we kind of had planned this uh trek to the east because we're both originally from this part of the country and so i think some of the things that i did paid off for instance one thing that i did that might even be a good suggestion for you uh was something i did on the outside i love old estate estate sales i happened to go to just a little estate sale that just a little white frame house where the couple uh was very old and had gone into nursing homes and uh all the men started going down to the barn and so i though[t]- well shoot i'm going to yes i'm going to the barn too they uh auctioned some tools and things like that but then they went over and started uh auctioning this big stack of bricks and so well i thought gee i've been wanting to do some brick uh walkways for a time anyway it ended up after some pretty uh heavy bidding that i got all those bricks for forty dollars and so my husband and i loaded bricks in his pickup truck for days but what we ended up with was about four thousand for forty dollars and so what we did we had built a deck on the back of that house but it needed and it was quite large out to into the yard but on either side of it to the ends of the house it just needed to be all tied together so we made brick patios and walkways and so for and he he did the digging which was about six inches but i figured the sand and all had that delivered and leveled it and and placed most all the bricks and it turned out beautifully yes well it nearly killed me i hated to leave it um-hum no we well i well no i i didn't have that trouble because um we laid the i did get some material and studied every bit of material that i could study but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them because when you start and we put them on a base of four inches of s[and]- sand and then we uh we swept sand in between but but it was an error to to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever you just put them together as close as you can um um-hum yeah well and i also used a rubber hammer a lot to um you know if it wasn't quite level or something i'd just get that rubber hammer and um and and prob[ably]- you know i think that they could if they have problems with uh sand bugs of some kind i think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a oh a fairly regular basis for a while anyway well i think sh[e]- i think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are and yeah is it Diazinon or what is it that will uh Dursban or something like that Dursban i think in this area or most all areas they use you know for ticks and fleas and you know they're awful hard to do anything with yeah i bet Dursban would do it yeah i think uh you probably just need to make sure that it dries very very carefu[lly]- uh well before she lets her cats out or something like

are you satisfied with the public school system in your area okay sure uh-huh yeah i don't agree with that either the the Robin Hood approach where the rich give to the poor no i don't people move to the suburbs to Richardson and Plano uh uh mostly because of the school district because of the level of education that's offered yeah well it costs uh so much in taxes here and uh even if they do give money to the poorer school districts i don't think it's going to lower my taxes at all yeah sure well that's that's exactly what what their doing um i don't think that's going to improve the talent as far as the school teaching uh goes yeah well i think it is too uh ever[y]- no i went to school in Wisconsin right uh-huh well we need qualified teachers no matter whether they're teaching in the inner city or the suburbs uh the trouble is that uh the suburbs are able to pay more that's going to attract the the better uh teachers sure and uh it cost more in tax money too so well it could very well be uh there is a definite racial split here well i was in a rural area in Wisconsin and uh we had a good public school system but i don't think it was great i think the curriculum was very deficient to prepare people to go to college but uh the the racial mix of um students in my area was entirely white we had uh no minorities at all okay well that's interesting huh right sure well the good school districts here do have honors programs uh they do encourage that among the students who are uh prepared to go to college but uh that brings up a whole uh bunch of other problems um sure all right i haven't heard that yet that's interesting i know some people at work who uh have uh children in high school and they're not satisfied with the school district at all and they do send their kids to the priv[ate]- s[chool]- private schools um they send them to Saint Marks i think where ever that's located yeah uh-huh well h[e]- he said about six hundred a month and that doesn't include their personal expense so you're you're talking about uh college uh level fees here sure but i think i think the honors programs are good in the high schools but uh some of the problems you get are the kids that are in those programs get harassed by their peers for doing too well and that discourages them from doing well so uh yeah uh-huh well their allowed to progress at their own pace then all right no i can relate to part of that uh in in my high school uh say just for for example in my math courses uh i i was not to brag about this at all i was so far ahead of everybody else that i didn't have to go to class and i got to sit by myself in an empty room while everybody else was in class taking algebra an[d]- work at my own pace sure yeah yeah i'm sure that has a definite effect yeah well i i know people uh i don't have any kids either but uh fr[om]- i know people who had been neighbors once upon a time who had kids and whenever the father was traveling away on business or they they had financial problems their kids uh their it was definitely noticed at their performance in school yeah it got so bad with with this one kid that uh the the school uh called their parents up to ask if there were any problems going on because his performance at school had degraded so much i i believe in that yeah right well i remember as a kid uh they had PTA Parent Teacher Association meetings all the time and uh my parents always went to those uh i i don't know sure uh-huh yeah well the the dropout rate is so high in Dallas and Fort Worth uh yes it is i i think it's uh thirty eight per[cent]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

and how long have you lived there okay well you're familiar then very well with what's going on there we just moved to North Carolina from Oklahoma and i'm not yet familiar we're out in the country a little bit so it's a contract garbage pickup and it's all thrown together in this area they don't have that good uh-huh good uh-huh excuse me do you have to bundle it or okay yeah right uh-huh well good uh-huh um yes required it yes right uh-huh uh-huh that is nice and i've read articles here uh about the confusion involved in what is to be put out and what isn't and the problems that uh some of the recycling centers are having because of the slick magazine pages in with the newspaper which they say ruins the whole batch and uh uh unacceptable plastics in with the plastics which ruins the whole batch and i just wondered uh uh-huh right uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh right uh-huh recollecting the the plastic bags yeah we right uh-huh right right right well we've had we've been collecting papers here and w[e]- uh as new residents we don't have affiliation with uh scout troops and and all that we had a difficult time finding in Charlotte uh a place to finally put them which surprised me and i thought they would be uh located throughout the city and we've called and finally found one but it's about uh fifteen miles away no no right outside north of uh of Charlotte near the university is south and and east yes right uh-huh well how active how active are the schools there i'm i'm an old person Linda grew up uh during World War Two and we saved papers and tin foil and string and everything else and uh did it through the school systems and i've wondered if they're really active uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh that that was sort of my point too in addition to being a a good focal or central collection point it does raise the awareness if you do it through the school system and right uh-huh probably one of the worst things we ever done to ourselves McDonald's is doing uh-huh right oh yeah uh no uh how do you feel about the high school students that you you teach do you feel that they have the right i i get mixed emotions when i see a bunch of uh youngsters throwing things out of the car versus the[y]- they're talking about environment right right pressure is a big one yeah uh-huh well i yes i am too i am too well Linda i enjoyed talking to you thank you uh bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
okay there's there's one um i'm at living in Texas where you at in where Rome New York Rome New York okay well Texas let me look at my husband and ask him <b_aside> does Texas have state capital punishment <e_aside> yes they do he's reminding me of where i live yeah uh-huh uh-huh yes yeah i um i ethically don't like the idea but or i should say morally i don't like the idea but um social eth[ics]- eth[ics]- and ethics socially and ethically i think it's a good idea in certain crimes uh-huh uh-huh right and any demand on the street no i know uh-huh yeah and Texas is having a problem right now and it's the the the the the repeatable cri[me]- i think that's the the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they're they're patrol the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done oh heinous things from call[ing]- from uh killing police officers to i mean just multiple you know mo[lestations]- molestations to murders of children just you know really bad things and they're get these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered and and now they can't find them and they're finding bodies in di[tches]- you know i mean you thi[nk]- think why they say it's because you're over crowd[ed]- it's over crowded then you think how can every is everybody that stupid or is the world really that rotten right i know and then and i don't know how Americans are about handguns but uh yesterday a lady i work with just told me today that uh in the state capitol here in Austin Texas they had been uh looking at a bill uh making it easier to accept the bill to access to access handguns and they passed it which basically means without an FBI check any person in this state over twenty one can get a gun is it that's good say that good i think that's like the state of Virginia yeah that's great uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh right they're not the cattiness behind right yeah i mean i don't like guns in general but when i think about uh this topic like capital punishment i look at somebody i mean i just remember when i was in college in a dorm and i think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him but in Florida in the state of Washington when they had the Ted Bundy case and how they just exe[cuted]- well it hasn't been just but it was in the i think the second or third quarter of last year nineteen ninety and i had you know i knew some people that said why are you glad you di[d]- you know this had nothing and i said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that but i actually i mean there should be more cases like that where they flip a sw[itch]- i have and i might be too cold too but they flip a switch i don't know i mean so many yeah yeah i mean and that's just maybe because of the little more that they said celebrated that uh he's not the only one you know you you see somebody's mini series and you hear about somebody's crime there was something on and this gets back to capital punishment but the man had stolen uh not stolen but kidnapped uh some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in Florida and they changed all the facts that they said it was true and they buried her alive and Peter Strauss had played the lead role and the man and and the at the end of you know how they have these mini dramas at the end they said this set person was paroled like six months ago and you're thinking that's nice i mean you know i'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence but it does serve as a pun[ishment]- uh definite pun[ishment]- you know lasting punish[ment]- right in that particular instance um but i but i don't but i know it's not a end all and be all that's the problem i have with it in Texas they think it's an end all and be all they think that if they electrocute or slip or do something e[lse]- gas somebody um that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have and we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime ridden and we just moved here uh we've been here before lived in Minneapolis Saint Paul uh which has an exceedingly low crime rate and then we were transferred back here and when you're gone from some place like it for about six years as we were you really begin to see uh just how problematic just living is even suburban no matter where you are and how you're in Rome New York is that and and is that like near Albany or Syracuse what what type of area is that is that uh in term uh-huh uh-huh sure how would how is the situation in there in terms of crime and things that would not too bad yeah uh-huh not the harsh criminality that you find in yeah now Dallas is a i'm being very sarcastic it's just a great place um on some days uh it's um i don't know the good ole boy network here is uh very strange like i said they believe that if they kill somebody you know tit for tat and deed for deed that that does something uh but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that i mean they really are over crowded i mean that's that's just not a cop out um and i just you know i'm originally from Pennsylvania which i think is basically like New York these days i'm not sure if they i don't think they have capital punishment there uh-huh i'm not trying yeah and i'm from Pittsburgh so oh well we'll forgive each other um because they use to be very very conservative when i was growing up i and i can't i haven't lived there in twenty years but um there you go i don't know that's a different top[ic]- subject altogether but uh i don't know i think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime i think everyone would you and i think are probably honest and candid because we could do it on in this vehicle um but i think everybody if they were touched by it would say if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out which i think every human does i think they'd say yeah do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me you know um uh-huh yeah i just don't think that uh you can rehabilitate i mean i just don't uh oh i did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class and i just the subject i remember we drew things out of a hat and it was something uh just it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment and when you see how many repeat offenders there are uh check check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and um rape rapist getting their hand just slapped you know and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session you know all these uh i[ntangible]- i[ntangible]- intangible things and you're thinking you would not only would you not want to be a victim you wouldn't want to be a criminal because you wouldn't know what you're getting um but i don't know methods of capital punishment i have no opinions on that either uh-huh is it uh how about the injection is that suppose to be yeah i'm not even sure in the split among the fifty states do you know which way it is the ratio it's more than aren't uh that it's more that don't have it isn't that correct uh-huh uh-huh yeah and always say do something about i'm not sure if Texas Minnesota i they didn't they didn't they were again[st]- well did they have it they were against it um Texas as i said has it but i haven't been back here long enough to to realize whether or not if they've done it in the last	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well what are your did you like do you use credit cards huh-uh so it doesn't gets uh uh the credit uh uh interest rate is so high that you're really if you're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy i think don't you otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it's hardly uh it's not a very good idea well i have a lot of them but i don't use them very much though i use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes uh tuition if it's you know if i'm short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can the other thing i i think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off uh more than one at a time because i think you could run forever paying what they require just goes on and on yeah yeah that's true there are times when it's when it's very useful like uh emergency trip or something sometimes when you when you the the money will be available but it's you know not immediately handy i think uh they're very helpful plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes but uh i you really do need to be very um oh responsible about it or you end up in deep trouble uh-huh right right that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances the other thing about them is too if you really don't you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed and haven't developed a credit thing it stops you from doing a lot of things if you if you pay for everything by cash uh there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or a car so so they they have become a very vital part of our of our monetary system over the last few years but uh it's true you have to be very careful or you end up uh going in the deep end and uh and an awful lot of people are in trouble we have a boy living with us who works for a credit card uh company that and he makes calls to people who have problems you know credit problems that are trying to work out of them_1 and uh poor thing he comes home very depressed every because the world has so many problems of that sort so it's uh it's uh it's a really big problem i think and um takes mature people to to treat it uh so that it's so that it's a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage yeah right it doesn't do you any good now does it right even before it probably wasn't though because you didn't get anywhere near as much as what it you didn't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying so well i'm not that uh other than that i don't have too much on credit cards but it's good to talk to you uh-huh bye now	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh not very many of those at uh sometimes i i play the trumpet and sometimes i work on trumpet mouthpieces and then i have a five year old daughter and we cut out things kind of you know and color and uh and uh use markers and things like that um how about you uh-huh um yeah exactly uh-huh uh-huh i don't know my my father is in the in the antique business and he uh he goes around to garage sales and he buys all kinds of um china and figurines and statues and stuff and um there's some stuff that's really for um uh auto repair it's called J B Weld and i repaired a a gasoline tank with it once but he mixes colors in it it's an epoxy resin that you mix together and he makes like the other day he was working on a hand that was shattered on a a statue that's real small it's like about maybe the hand's about the size of a cricket and uh has uh like the forefinger sticking out and the thumb sticking out and he was repairing that and uh it came out pretty good it's kind of a kind of a ivory color all over and and uh has some age spots in it and it looked you know just like it it had been there all the time and he fixed some fixes some bowls that have the cracks or chips in them and uh molds that in he had a blue blue bowl a few weeks ago that he he fixed that way it worked out real well too and then he and then he um he thatches uh you know those uh thatched chairs course that's like that that uh hooking that you were talking about that takes a lot of time yeah and he used to paint um a long time ago but i think he's stopped pretty much now but outside of outside of art class in in school i i stopped doing most of that unless i i mean like he has a computer and i use um the graphics um software on that to uh to do figures and to to look at things you know see how they work uh-huh oh yeah sometimes but it's it's not one of my favorite things especially from the vapors and we had uh an entertainment center we did last year uh we bought it at an unfinished uh furniture place and sanded it down and uh stained it and then lacquered over it oh yeah um-hum sure is did you use a did you use a Zar stain uh they had a um well i saw the commercial on TV and they and uh and the people at the unfinished store recommended it that's called a it's Z A R and uh it spreads real evenly and it doesn't dry too fast so it's if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out and uh and we put we put tung oil on it kind of made it sticky for a while but after it dried out it was you know it was real hard and it was all right uh-huh yeah uh-huh were you in the were you in the Girl Scouts too or well it was nice talking to you okay you too bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
if you don't cook though what do you like to eat if you go to a dinner party um uh-huh uh-huh well uh i was just thinking as i was listening to this recording go over and over till they found a party for me to talk to i could talk about a dinner party i had uh Sunday and it included some seafood so that would probably be uh appropriate for you uh i had uh some people from Germany visiting and they are uh fans of American shrimp so i did a kind of a stir fry dish with shrimp that you shake up in a bag with a little parmesan cheese and flour and then uh quickly uh fry up in a little olive oil and then uh take out of the wok put some uh red strips of red pepper and green pepper in stir that a little bit uh add some uh sliced mushrooms and then put the shrimp back in with a half a cup of white wine and just bring it to a simmer and then you serve it on rice and it's really a a pretty low cholesterol dish because its done with the uh shrimp and the olive oil you don't use any kind of beef fat or no no animal fats in it And it's very popular and it looks very pretty and uh with rice and a salad you've got a a meal um oh that's a good place to get it i miss it i lived in Houston for a long time and we loved to go over to New Orleans to eat uh-huh oh yeah oh yes oh i wish i had the recipe for my grandmother's gumbo she used to make the most wonderful crab meat gumbo with shrimp and all sorts of other goodies in it My job was picking the crab not my favorite part uh-huh uh-huh yeah well the reason for using those is that it makes such a pretty colorful dish People always exclaim when you have the red and green peppers and if i'm making a whole lot uh i use a yellow pepper as well for one pound of shrimp i use one red pepper one green pepper and oh maybe half a dozen ten mushrooms medium sized mushrooms and that's plenty for four people and if they're light eaters you can squeeze in six but oh yeah that's good uh my husband is a Chinese cook he doesn't do much cooking either but he loves to cook Chinese and he has a marvelous uh chicken with cashews and and the Szechuan peppers now those are not the hot ones those are the little round pink ones and oh they are wonderful that uh he does that uh uh chicken with cashews and Szechuan peppers and he also not at the same meal does a wonderful vegetable dish with Szechuan peppers but use that uses either asparagus or um let's see what does he use asparagus is the one we like the best oh broccoli you can do the same dish with broccoli and also if you're really in a pinch you can do it with just celery and it's pretty good uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh i like them too i think they're great uh we i've been trying to convince the cook at uh at the place where i work uh we are kind of isolated and so we don't go out to lunch very often and we do have an excellent kitchen uh which is encouraging for people to stay around and uh eat and interact with one another at lunch we're a think tank so that's one of our functions is to get people to talk to each other and she has started cooking uh much healthier food m[uch]- much more uh salad without mayonnaise and uh much more uh main dishes without oils and uh and the vegetable i mean and uh animal fats so i think we're improving our diets i don't know whether it's the California influence or whether it's everywhere but uh-huh well my husband's cholesterol is not real high but he his father had uh an early heart attack and so he is very conscious of his uh physical condition and he walks a lot and tries to get uh to stay in pretty good shape and to watch out for high cholesterol and since i prefer the kinds of foods that one eats on a m[oderately]- moderately low cholesterol diet anyway that suits me just fine um yeah yeah uh-huh yeah we don't either we just eat it once in a great while and uh it's usually if we're having company and it's somebody that we know is a big meat fan but there're fewer and fewer of those so we also do an awful lot of cooking when it's just the two of us on a little tiny uh grill it's oh it's less than a foot long and about eight inches wide and uh we just put a few charcoals in there and uh we can cook a piece of chicken we buy boneless chicken breasts and save us ourselves a lot of time And that with uh do have you ever tried Lawrey's Lemon Pepper you can buy it in the grocery store it's a well it has sea salt in it and but it's not the same as uh they have the Lawrey's seasoned salt and the Lawrey's season[ing]- Lemon Pepper and the Lemon Pepper's the one i love on chicken and fish and uh yeah just barely brush it with oil grill it uh so it's not too done and sprinkle a little of that on it and then i add some lemon thyme from my garden and that makes an excellent and very easy to fix dinner well i hope you have a nice lunch i'm just looking at our menu unfortunately we're having a terrible lunch here today for the cholesterol people because uh we're going to have Italian sausage and French fries i think i may stick to the salad bar today nice to talk to you too okay bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

have you had any thoughts on this um-hum how old are you if i can ask how old are you okay so we're about the same age um-hum um-hum yeah i think this is also a a broader scope i think uh they're talking about uh just service in general and um i i did a lot of this sort of thing in in college in the summers um i worked uh in uh Mexico doing community service f[or]- uh for two summers while i was in college and you know it was an incredibly worthwhile experience so in theory i'm am favor of this but on the other hand i'm an economist and uh just like uh well the military has a tremendous uh you know responsibility for security and everything but there's also an equally tremendous budget so i guess on the other hand as a[s]- as as good as this idea is it's got to be paid for uh even though it's uh you know it it's it's never quite voluntary people have to be paid if they're asked to serve for a year in any capacity so uh you know uh uh the idea's great where does the money come an[d]- um-hum it should i[t]- it should or shouldn't it should um-hum but i don't think it w[as]- it was voluntary i think it was just the re[quired]- year of required service there was nothing about voluntary that's why as an economist my my ears perked up um-hum uh-huh and doing it at a less expensive rate then uh-huh of course you'll probably get another whole layer of bureaucracy running it i mean let's face it the military is probably so i- i- i you know on the one hand my immediate reaction to it was oh it's wonderful you know i think people do owe their country something whether it they serve in the military or for those who f[or]- for one reason or other can't want to serve in another area and have talents in another ar[ea]- great but then who pays and if they have to and they don't go into the lab[or]- the other labor force you're losing money in terms of taxing from other jobs i mean so there's it's not it's not a real cut and dry thing um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum and just marching around waiting for a yeah uh we did have something similar to a volunteer thing with uh which was vo[lunteer]- although volunteer there was a minimum payment uh like Vista which was a domestic Peace Corps some time back and probably coming from Texas you may have bumped into some of that oh yeah and i know the ar[my]- what's the army has a corps of engineers which uh could probably be one of those areas that uh could be uh privatized or civilianized or whatever some of the areas there you know for domestic use i've always wondered why the army corps o[f]- of engineers took care of floods in in areas why was um-hum um-hum but of course there are many private engineering schools that are absolutely superb yeah they made um-hum yeah and of course back during the depression when the government started doing things like uh CCC the Civilian Conservation Corps so i uh you know there's a bit of a history of people serving the government and it doesn't have to be as the military you know if you go in just as a as an enlistee uh the wage isn't anything great so if if you're asking for a year of service it doesn't have to be a wage comparable to the uh if it's a required year it doesn't have to be a wage comparable to the private sector so it could be you know a wage enough to for have someone to live on to eat and if uh if in fact so i guess that it a lot of thinking would have to be done if it were implemented um-hum how it's administered and how you know uh just the who uh who who would be exempted because i'm sure there would be exemptions to it uh um-hum um-hum or even or even doing paperwork for a police systems you know um-hum yeah homeless homeless and all i think they're going to cut us off oh oh yeah but i think you know in terms of the the the cri[me]- pressing problems in the United States today that in terms of the homeless in terms of the state of the the state of the prisons um there're there're probably a lot of things that could be done uh on a volunteer basis so maybe they should do pilot projects to try it out to see how it works yeah well listen it was good talking with you okay bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

you want to go first yeah like the governme[nt]- if should the government make it universal or something like that uh-huh you you would be in favor of it uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh do they have options on who they uh you know like choices of doctors and that type of thing do you uh-huh uh-huh that's the way with me i don't know a whole lot about it i woul[d]- that's the only concern i would have because i think personalities plus the type of doctor it is has a lot to do with the care and if you didn't have any choice on you know on who you go to uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh or to change even like if you didn't approve or didn't think you were getting good service uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh tha[t]- that's one of my main concerns i i have a friend that has their boy has been sick for several months and they just have found out what's the trouble and they have gone through uh one two three four five doctors and then a team of doctors and they finally determined what the problem was it took that long and that that something like that you know i thought if you couldn't change or look elsewhere you know for help if you wa[nt]- i don't know how that program works you know if you can do that uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh um-hum i guess that's that's primarily was one of my thoughts you know because you know how government is uh-huh for them to have a choice on if they're in favor of it or not it it would um-hum uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh huh uh-huh uh uh-huh uh-huh i know where my son works they have uh an option right now where they can have their own physician or they can choose one that their company has elected and that costs them less if they take the doctor that the that the company has selected he get well only to the point that he could go to somebody at his own expense otherwise he w[ould]- you know he has to take the physician that uh and the hospital that the company has chosen as their you know the one they have taken and their again i mean he's gotten good service he took the less expensive one of course uh-huh uh right right yeah uh because_1 that's the first i've really known anybody that you know works for somebody that they had that option you know to make the choice of what kind of insurance policy they what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take uh-huh oh if you have your health you're wealthy you really are yeah uh we live in a rural area up here uh are you familiar with any of the area at all where oh well that's that's a ways away but we live in Clarion County uh we have a cousin that lives in Philadelphia and uh yes uh-huh oh uh-huh that's a nice state so i suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in you know like more populated areas as far as uh the doctors that are available course we have good physicians here too we've been pretty fortunate we've had some of the most outstanding doctors in our area for some of the different fields so uh we've been pretty fortunate um-hum oh yeah uh-huh uh-huh oh yeah uh-huh it sure is i still wish they could do more with the cancer situation though they uh they just don't seem to be i know they're making progress but not like that i would like to see yeah yeah uh-huh uh-huh but a maj[ority]- a lot of them don't do these things even and it doesn't seem to matter so uh it real uh-huh well they say second hand smoke and that is worse than smoking so so what do you do you know yeah yeah take their rights away from them they say i never had the desire so i haven't ever had that problem as far as that goes so i can't take any credit for not smoking either so it's hard to break it's a hard one to quit yeah yes very nice talking to you too and you have a good day right okay um bye bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay i work for a temporary service and so our benefits are a lot more limited than what you would have if you worked a regular full time job we have to work a certain number of hours and then we get holiday pay and vacation pay and they if you um i could if i wanted to i'd i'm not right now um i have been yeah you like you have to work twelve hundred hours um within a year to get holiday pay and fifteen hundred hours within a year to get vacation pay so if you're not working enough hours to get that much time in in a year then you don't get the benefit yeah yeah you don't get anything at all uh-huh right yeah my husband has good benefits too or i probably wouldn't be able to do the temporary work i think medical is probably one of the most important things to have wow um-hum yeah those must be pretty good benefits i've heard that usually they average about thirty percent of your salary so it sounds like maybe his company's a little bit better right yeah uh no fortunately we still have the it's just regular traveler's insurance that my husband has so we can go anywhere i guess that's good i don't know uh i can't decide oh yeah uh-huh really yeah my husband works for a psych hospital and i know that they sometimes have to discharge people before they're really ready because their insurance won't let them_1 stay any longer it frustrates him because they'll just be getting somebody to the point where they can really make some progress and then they're gone yeah really right yeah yeah do you uh does your husband's company have any of the new like a cafeteria plan where he gets to pick and chose any of his benefits right yeah that's one thing i wish that we had was like a 401K plan or one of those things were they matched what you could save those are really good deals yeah that or retire i don't think we can plan on social security taking care of us so yeah with what they say about how the population's changing i think attitudes'll have to change to go along with that and that'll probably change the insurance benefits too as people get older and still work and they'll need more health care so yeah does that just supplement like Medic[are]- Medicare or yeah yeah that's good see i my husband been self-employed and he's worked for uh like a small companies and now he's in a little bit bigger company so we've seen a little bit of every kind of benefit you can have right yeah when we when he was se[lf]- self-employed and we had to get our own insurance to get maternity benefits was just ridiculous i mean you c[ould]- you might as well have saved the money you paid every month and paid your own hospital bill at the end of the year or something right yeah yeah it's scary well it was good talking to you you too bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well the last three days it's been pretty rainy we went to the beach and uh it started uh let's see around four o'clock and uh it had thunder and lightning it was and then you know it was just overcast and rainy for uh the next t[wo]- two or three days straight how about_1 yours uh-huh you're from Virginia oh from Texas i heard they had some flooding down there uh-huh hum uh-huh well the last couple of years we're um we're over as far as our rainfall goes before that it was really dry and uh everybody was you know talking about rationing water and doing this and doing that not really rationing water but just cutting down and uh it seems like uh you know the weather pattern is just shifting and uh that uh jet stream is moving uh into our area North Carolina and across but it's uh changing latitude oh yeah uh-huh it's finally cleared up it's just now st[ill]- still a little overcast but the s[un]- but the sun has finally started popping out oh yeah well right now as a matter of fact i'm fixing to go play tennis it's um i'd say it's at least seventy nine eighty well about seventy eight seventy nine degrees um actually the uh the wind normally blows let's see let me think about this south southwest yeah uh but a[ctually]- but actually our i guess our weather pattern comes from the uh blows north east yeah you're right it blows north east um-hum uh-huh how f[ar]- how far are you from Houston oh i see so you so you don't ha[ve]- you don't get anything off the Gulf uh immediately from from the ocean uh-huh hm well we've had some you know pretty pretty rough winds oh uh Bangla[desh]- Bangladesh boy they they caught it bad but we'll probably have our share of the hurricanes i know uh Hurricane Hugo you probably heard about that uh last year yeah and they're still uh rebuilding from that storm so the the beaches here just get really beat up uh and it usually comes this way it comes up from uh Miami uh down around or you know around the Bahamas and it usually travels uh northwest and uh it'll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits um let's see two years ago we had one as a matter of fact it went within a mile of my house and uh it was real odd the um barometric pressure drops during a tornado and our uh fire alarm went off of course that woke everybody up and we knew what was going on to uh you know go downstairs or go into the bedroo[m]- bathroom and uh take cover but uh we get uh yeah we're we're uh we get our share of tornadoes no huh-uh we're about two hours from the beach so uh you know it's uh barometric pressure i believe is higher in the mountains and we ca[tch]- we catch some winds you know a few winds coming off of them_1 i think but uh let's see y'all just had a tornado uh over close to Oklahoma and Texas uh-huh oh gosh oh did it hum um boy i would have like to have heard that that cou[ld]- that would have been something uh-huh uh-huh i used to live in Amarillo originally so i'm oh yeah we used to sit out uh especially in Borger we use to sit out on our back uh picnic table and watch them_1 come out of the sky through the funnel clouds and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground but otherwise we'd just sit back there and watch them_1 go in and out of those clouds yeah yep yeah you'd be amazed at how clear the sky was but the clouds are just really uh uh rolling kind of just real pillowy i guess oh well i was in that uh big tornado went through Wichita Falls and uh the sky i mean we were right in the middle of it when i mean signs and telephone poles were dropping all around us and a whole roof of a restaurant came off and uh it was a eerie uh a real eerie blue green color and the lightning was almost continuous just uh you know as if you put your hand on one of those electric uh things that causes lightning uh i think it was called the storm but um the s[ky]- the whole sky was full of that eerie blue green uh lightning um uh-huh we haven't got that much rain but uh when it rains it's it's been down pouring you too okay thanks bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

there we go um normally it takes me a lot to get through but this is pretty quick do you have children oh oh my goodness well then you've obviously had some experience with child care really uh what do you mean oh wow now what did you look for when you were looking for child care um-hum oh it it it um-hum yeah that's nice lucky um-hum um-hum that's okay um-hum uh-huh um well what you know i work in a personnel agency and um so i'm constantly interviewing and placing people in jobs and i've just really become discouraged in people's own sense of responsibility and dependability um and what what's hard for me is i don't have children but i would imagine once i do i'm probably going to need to find some sort of child care and it worries me it worries me a lot because i just um i- i d[on't]- i don't know who i could feel comfortable trusting my children with It it i yeah um-hum um-hum i know um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah i know oh i know um-hum um-hum oh it certainly is um and um-hum oh wow um-hum that's great um-hum um-hum well not only ye[ah]- not only does that make you uh just have you know more peace of mind but isn't that great for the child too to not be with strangers and even though they're you know getting to know the people and it's probably good for them to you know be out of the house and all that but just to have a parent with them so few families are able to do that these days that the fact that you're able to do it and and that your siblings could that's just wonderful um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah oh yeah right um-hum um-hum definitely um-hum definitely and we're going to see more like you were saying corporate i think we're going to see more uh maybe even a corporate contribution i mean just companies helping to to pay for it because it's just not uh it's a necessity um-hum yes that's what we do here uh-huh pre tax dollars that that you're yeah that's wh[at]- that's what we have here well uh-huh oh they do have on site care oh i'm sorry oh um-hum boy yeah sending people off and um-hum oh i know um-hum yes yeah oh yeah um and and i guess you know it's just it's too scary to be reading the papers and hearing on the news they always say that um you know all these horrible things happen in the most comfortable places like uh sexually abused children it's happening with a neighbor or with somebody that they think they knew well and trusted um and that's the scary thing is that you think okay these people are good because you can trust them and and all that then they're the ones that might you know turn around and and be the ones that cause the problem it's it's really scary it's um i my husband is a professor or i should say he will be a professor and um i'm looking forward to his schedule being flexible and to mine a[nd]- you know at some point being flexible so that we can sort of juggle our own schedules around and and create some sort of way that we can be around you know not necessarily at the same time but at least one of us be there one woman that we have in our office um he works during the day and she works in the evenings part-time and so you know even though she's only working part-time she's not spending money on the day care so it's almost like you're not um you know maybe you're not making as much but you're not spending as much either yeah um-hum oh my goodness um-hum oh wow isn't that ideal yes right right and a company that can allow that yeah right is this true or what um-hum that i[s]- what a neat idea um-hum wow that's amazing yes that is very good i like that um it's right yeah i know you're not isn't that interesting wow i would imagine that must be hard to to not bring your work home though you know um they probably oh really oh well that's that's good i mean if some couples want to do that i think that's great and uh you you just got to change your life around somehow when you're going to have kids no question about it um-hum yeah yeah um-hum yeah now do y[ou]- are your kids is are your older ones at an age where they're taking care of the younger ones yet or oh they are oh good um-hum um-hum y[eah]- yeah um-hum um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time um-hum uh-huh yeah oh i uh like sports type things too we like to get out and walk and we like the water sports too but like you it's unless you have a pool in your backyard it's kind of hard to get to do that very often yeah well part-time we're going to have a baby in July so part of my big hobby has been trying to put together a nursery and all that kind of stuff lately but yeah it does i've been yes uh-huh i've been doing some cross-stitch for something i wanted to put in the nursery so i haven't done that in years but i've kind of enjoyed that but it's just hard to find the time to sit there and do it and right yeah and i guess i kind of consider shopping a hobby i just go out just to just to enjoy it and not really spend money sometimes just look yeah yeah we bought some baby clothes yeah last weekend at a garage sale yeah uh-huh oh wow yeah yeah it kind of a hobby it that's time consuming too really to find the things you want sometimes you have to stop a lot of places right yeah i think that's important too i'm not going to work after the baby comes so i guess hopefully i'll have time for more hobbies i do not know right yes wow yeah yeah so that's good a whole fam[ily]- your whole family can enjoy those hobbies oh oh wow that'll make the summer go by in a hurry keep the kids busy right yeah yeah um do you consider yard work a hobby at all or is that just a chore uh-huh yeah oh no oh well we like it once in a while but not as often as we have to do it i like to put flowers out and you know a few little things like that but as far as mowing every week and finding time to get all that stuff done it gets to be a chore seems like sometimes hobbies do that they kind of and turn into work instead of fun yeah if it doesn't go quite right oh no oh that's nice yeah your how funny i think i'll enjoy cooking more when i'm not working when i don't get home -[un]til five thirty or six and i have to cook and clean up it's it's not fun but i think i'll like it better yeah uh yeah we've done a little bit of camping we like that it's there again it's just so hard to find time to get away for a whole weekend oh that sounds fun yeah well that sounds nice i i think that'll be a good family thing to start doing more often if uh-huh yeah we've camped with some friends who have young children and uh if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a lot oh they have so much fun doing that and they think they're really great fishermen because_1 they're catching so many oh yeah skip this tournament right yeah do you do any other crafts or anything besides just sewing it's not too hard it's i don't think it's as hard as like knitting or crochet or something like that uh yeah yeah i started to s[weater]- kn[it]- to knit a sweater and i got off on my rows somehow and so what should have been the back all of a sudden was on the and then i tore it out and threw it i never have picked it back up again and now i can't remember anything about it oh uh-huh yeah forget it yeah yeah i remember that yeah yeah yeah they are pretty easy well it's been real good talking to you and i hope you enjoy your camping trip um-hum bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay well what kind of music did you all listen to uh-huh no now well then you was in the uh or i am sorry i am going to make you sound like you're eighty something okay Woodstock what was yeah what was you doing during Woodstock um-hum you would have had a ball i- i kind of liked would have liked to have been there yeah don't you wish you'd been able to though oh that would have been such a great memory yeah yeah you went and planted a tree or something well w[ell]- growing up with when i grew up it just wasn't we did not have any causes to me it didn't doesn't seem like we've got much you know what i mean well i do remember demonstrations over busting yeah well right by the time i was born even now you know women's rights uh we just we are totally equal now there is not really a lot to fight fo[r]- now i saw something on TV last night on Twenty Twenty you know men uh fathers or daddies now wait a minute daddies are people too it's about a lot of men you know all right going through divorces the judge will usually uh give custody to the mother ninety seven percent of the time because_1 they go through the female and yeah something like that but it does seem you know yeah it really does yeah they are well i thought about that i thought well now men you know have to fight to be equal and i think that's only right though really he one guy said the judge looked at him and said well now mister so and so he says i've have never seen uh calves follow a bull they always follow the heifer that is why i always he said that is why i always give custody to the mama and he said well he said does that mean you are going to shoot them_1 if they break a leg and you know butcher them_1 if they get fat he said my kids are not cattle you know but that that is the way most people feel that women should get custody yeah i am married and i've got two kids my husband is not a conformist at all he is still back there in the seventies well i mean he is still wearing bell bottoms jea[ns]- not bell bottoms but flared pants and and he well i don't like them_1 but you know to him yeah any day now well he just you know he is he is his own person he you know he does stay with it as far as music and stuff goes but he wears what clothes he wants to which we are both that way if something is out of style i don't really care if i like it i'm gonna wear it but uh my husband is not a conformist at all uh-huh well uh we are trying to keep away from that my husband works for the railroad we have got it real tight but i've got a four month old baby and i do not want to work i want to tend to her i want to raise my kids um-hum well right well when he grew up he grew up with his we both grew up with single mothers and my mom had six kids so she had to work and you know i was raised by my sisters and stuff and i can i can't see the difference but i know that it would have been better had mom been able to stay home with us right right and my husband was the same way and we just i want to raise my kids i do not want a day care or an aunt or anybody else raising them_1 i want to be there to make sure that well they need guidance and they do need parental guidance twenty four hours a day do you stay home with yours uh-huh they raise them_1 well but see now yeah <b_aside> okay sweetie let mommy talk <e_aside> well i think that's neat right um-hum well i know the family is really going through changes but now we're trying to go back to about the sixties when the parents you know when the mother was staying at home or that what do they call it the nuclear family yeah but uh um well my family's in Kentucky now m[y]- my one of my sisters is down here her husband happened to get a job at TI they moved out here but w[ell]- his family lives here and my husband was in the service when i met him and so we we've been all ov[er]- <b_aside> okay Kyle <e_aside> he got a sunburn in the kitchen so i keep having to scratch his back the uh i would love to get a business going out of my home outside of i mean going yeah i'd would work at home if i could yeah that's the trend yeah they are bringing offices i mean jus[t]- i mean big businesses into their homes bringing their computers home and working from there w[ell]- i think f[or]- i think one that would be uh it's uh kids could see their parents you know how hard they work they would understand more when uh we first moved down here i was working i was working a twelve hour shift it was three and four days a week and uh oh my little boy just he went wild you know i mean because because_1 he had been used to me being there all the time yeah and he's just now well when i got pregnant i went ahead and quit work and decided just to stay at home and it was costing too much at home than more at home than i was bringing in so uh-huh no it seems like it's totally different of course i do not have much to compare it to to me our causes don't seem as important as you all's were do you know what i mean you you what we passed them on to us no okay yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

what type of news media do you prefer for keeping up with current events the news shows themselves or uh like network news or national or uh okay how about shows like uh Sixty Minutes or or Twenty Twenty yeah i kind of watch for uh what what they're going to cover on Sixty Minutes if it's not if it doesn't look interesting uh pass on that yeah i'll only get the newspaper a couple of days a week but uh i get a lot of calls from uh the Morning News and the Times Herald where they want to sell me the paper at a special rate but uh no i'll only read it on on Fridays and Sundays typically Friday because they have a house and garden section in the paper yeah i get the Sunday paper because of the TV schedule but i'll flip through and see what read the headlines see what's new yeah i- i don't listen to the radio for news that's strictly for entertainment while i'm driving to and from work and for waking up in the morning have to set the alarm whatever news they cover they usually read out of the newspaper that day oh i thought CNN was great but uh i was glued to the TV all during that time watching CNN but after after it was over i haven't even tuned in to CNN since uh-huh yeah there has to be absolutely nothing else on TV before i turn on CNN usually yeah uh i'll catch uh some of these news briefs that they have say at the top of the hour in the evening and they'll mention the subject and say they have details at ten i hate it when they do that because i usually don't catch the news at ten o'clock and they don't fill you in at that time on uh what's going on even though it's something interesting that you may want to watch um yeah usually with the people i work with uh uh we don't talk too much about the news but if something comes up uh yeah it's a topic for discussion at the lunch table uh-huh no we don't discuss too much uh too much news except for at lunch unless there are rumors for pertaining to layoffs or company business things of that nature uh-huh yeah you get a lot of different perspectives that way uh-huh do you get any news magazines okay i don't get any news magazines but i do get a uh a photography magazine that does have a lot of photo journalism in it which is interesting instead of reading about the news you get to look at the pictures uh-huh okay yeah yeah i think the coverage has gotten better are are you real satisfied with the TV news coverage are there other things that you'd like them to to spend more time on they're they're very limited they have half hour to pr[ovide]- provide all the news weather sports and what not and uh most of the major stories are the same across all the ne[twork]- major networks but uh they do have uh uh scoops and specific stories that um i'll say one network that another one won't cover uh-huh yeah yeah i think it's good that we do get a lot of variety in news coverage although uh TV networks and uh there are radio stations that uh specifically cater to the news yeah well it's like i read a lot at work and i really have to make an effort to read anything when i get home i think that's why uh uh reading newspaper suffers to watching TV and TV is more entertaining uh it uh usually have it on all the time when i'm at home whether i'm watching it or not yeah um that's uh that's a weekly chore get rid of the old newspapers that haven't been read yeah well i get the Sunday paper tomorrow and i'll pull out the TV section and put that aside and i get out the sports section and read that and then i start clipping coupons and if i have any time uh later in the week to read the rest of it i may pick it up and uh glance at it but uh i usually don't scan it cover to cover yeah huh that's interesting no uh-huh right yeah i believe that's true uh-huh yeah well think that's that gets back to what i was saying before about uh the say the network news coverage they only have so much time to provide so much uh coverage of the news and they can't get very in depth in the with the within the limitations of the time that they have to present it well sure but uh you're talking about uh sensationalism here that you have to report the news and typically news is is uh or ty[pes]- the types of events that uh shock people or uh uh major crimes uh court cases things of that nature and most uh it's just a fact that most things that make news are are bad types of occurrences they aren't uh positive in nature yeah there is a show on there is a show on in fact it was on tonight at eight o'clock called Cops have you ever seen that that's very very interesting gives you a whole new perspective of the police department right yeah well i think they actually came up with that to show not just to to fill in on Saturday night but to promote the image of the police department because it does show uh what positive impact the police have in the society not just that they're always there when bad things happen oh yeah well like environmentalist and uh	0 0 0

i guess we're ready well i w[ell]- um well it's been a long time since i been in uh involved with public school systems uh my youngest girl has graduated and she graduated in eighty nine so um-hum well i don't know if uh you mean they keep the children they want the teachers to keep the children longer hello uh what do you mean by that statement do you mean they want the ch[ildren]- uh the teachers to keep the children longer than they're supposed to or are they to train them in all phases of life really you mean just i[n]- well the discipline starts in the home and carries over into the school when they are school age and and and i think the school i thin[k]- oh that's well well it's just gotten uh completely out of hand as far as the violence in the schools and i don't know what the solution to that is at all i mean its just uh to me it's utter chaos i don't know how some of those teachers function because uh they are being violated by the students and i know that there are some schools that are patrolled by um private police and even public police and and and they're not getting any satisfaction from that effort i think uh i don't know what the solution is if the government doesn't know how are the um there's somebody that needs to rise up and have a plan that is going to resolve the many issues that are facing the public school system and i wouldn't know where to start since i haven't been involved in the public school system that much when my children were in school they were in a in a private school system so i mean we just i mean they just knew that they had to toe the line otherwise they would uh suffer the consequences and and that was enough for them i mean they just were very responsible kids and i didn't have any problems with them_1 and i believe that uh that starts in the home and then if the children are influenced i guess they're influenced by their peers and uh monkey see monkey do a lot of times and it kind of well i guess that's the bottom line if the children do know right from wrong and uh with uh with so many of the parents being disorganized themselves it's no wonder that the children are so you have to look at that uh factor also where those children are coming from and what kind of home life they have	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well i know that uh i have only like two or three favorite television shows i think one of my favorite then is from the guy Stephen is it Brochco who does like LA Law uh-huh and uh he also did Hillstreet Blues i like those type of shows uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh yeah me too i know they uh i think they're different than a lot of other shows of which they have like the reruns in the middle of the season and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns they start showing some of their newer stuff so i thought that was really interesting the way that they did that oh and so you must watch a lot of uh Disney or cartoons then um-hum right um-hum um-hum oh that's true that's true well i noticed that my kids are uh older now they're uh getting close to the teenage years but they did we watched all of Mister Rogers and everything but even some of your uh cartoons can be very violent and uh you know they they talk about death and we were watching uh oh gosh that Bugs Bunny just last night and um uh i think it was on uh i have to remember which channel but anyway uh we were watching that and it was talking about opera and they showed like what they thought an opera would be and one of the things was to kill the rabbit kill the rabbit and i thought oh how violent you know to kill the rabbit so he ended up killing the rabbit in the end uh but then of course the the rabbit comes back to life and says well see this is how an opera is supposed to be and i thought gee whiz if a little kid was watching this you know that would be pretty violent even uh for a small child um-hum right that's right that's right well i don't think cartoons portray that but like yeah yeah a cat has nine lives but they don't they just have one like we do oh so that's really funny but uh we've gotten uh-huh go ahead um-hum um-hum yes yes yeah that's true that's a good show i used to watch uh Dallas i don't i don't know where you're at Dallas yeah yeah i used to watch Dallas ye[ars]- years ago and somewhere in the middle i got uh bored and uh so i in fact i didn't even watch the finale uh you know that's about how disinterested i had become uh-huh well actuall[y]- uh-huh yep yep i know i know wa[s]- was it actually based on a book oh but you were just talking about okay okay yeah right that's true that's true stay um-hum um-hum yeah in if you notice and if you notice on Dallas they lost all the women yes so the men mainly stayed but the women were the ones who left and i thought that was very interesting and wondered kind of wondered about that uh well anyway that's a whole new issue oh goodness so anyway i don't know if our five minutes are over yet but we uh we also have the paid uh television channels uh the only thing i don't like about it especially with teenagers is that all the violence the sex the nudity and the curse words you know and so i know they didn't pick up these curse words from me so uh they had to have picked them up from uh the T V one nice thing though about the cable company we use they have uh they have that little parental uh uh key yeah yeah um-hum so i- i have that at home and i keep the keys with me and that's about the only way that i can that i can do it because_1 their natural curiosity you know to go towards that way and want yeah um-hum um-hum yeah that's true well and here lately it hasn't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high well it was nice talking to you okay talk with you later good-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay you say you're going to buy a new car um-hum yeah yeah right right uh-huh yeah yeah i- i understand that we uh just paid off one my wife's car uh i guess l[ast]- early last year and so we're you know enjoying not having that that payment every every month and but it's getting up in age uh we're trying to hold out a little while longer uh we've got a a a daughter who's almost two now so we're getting to the point where we really kind of need something a little bigger than what we've got but uh so i guess if we when we do buy another car it'll it'll be something that we can uh kind of grow into a little bit it's it's tough on trips because uh anywhere anytime we we're getting ready to go anywhere it's uh you know it's uh it's uh try like trying to like put a puzzle together to make sure you get everything in the car you know cause it um-hum right that's what i that's i ideally i would like that in fact uh you know i i've i've thought of that possibly uh give i don't know that my wife would go for it you know i would i'd like to do that i- i i have a truck myself and i[t]- i'll i'll like you know a truck's a thing that y[ou]- you you need when you need it but you know the rest of the time you wonder you know could i use something else so i i've still got a couple years payments on it i may uh if we can hold out till then you know if i get get to where i need it something else maybe maybe buy a van because they are really really nice for for long trips especially um-hum right right right hum right oh i don't either well my wife's car is probably around five years old now it's it's got oh uh i guess it must have seventy or eighty thousand miles on it you know and so it's it's getting it's not not in bad shape it's it's you know she's kept it up real well but uh you know it's it's getting to the point where we really need to do something with it you know if we're going to get anything out of it so so i'm i'm uh i'm i'm hoping we can work something out here we've got other bills that kind of pre[cede]- precede or preclu[de]- preclude us buying something buying something else it really is and you know and you can't uh you can't afford uh you know a a car payment now it jus[t]- will wipe you out every month it's almost getting wanting to be like a house payment you right right um-hum oh i didn't know that um-hum oh man yeah right right uh-huh right right now uh that's that's her pro[blem]- our our daughter's problem you know because_1 when you when you get out on the road like that and it's just long stretches you know where they just have to sit you know in town she does okay you know and even on the road she does all right for a little while because she'll sleep some but you know she she wakes up she wants to to get up a[nd]- i know l[ights]- uh t[o]- coming uh right around Christmas we were we were uh Christ[mas]- right before Christmas we had driven over to Shreveport and we were driving back and it was when all that bad weather was was hitting and the roads were all closed and uh we were trying to get back and it w[ell]- took us a lot longer and she was you know she was pretty good most of the way but then got to a point where she just had to get out of her seat and we had to stop and and we got out and played in the snow and put her back in and she was fine but you know if we had if there was something to where she could kind of get up and and move around like you say on on the highway or where it wasn't wasn't as bad you know just for a little brief period of time it would be it would be okay so i'm i'm thinking maybe we can can do something like that later on ye[ah]- we'll see what we can do yeah well i you too i ho[pe]- hope everything works out right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

oh uh-huh uh-huh that's the way we always were we always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up so well i guess we're going to talk about children today so you ready my children are all gone already they're they're all out on their own so uh do you want to start first do you y[ou]- uh do you work uh-huh uh-huh right right um-hum yeah but yet most of the problems we hear of course maybe that's what we hear about is from organized approved day care centers but maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be you know the individual incidence or something uh-huh how old is your oldest oh well he's plenty big enough then um-hum um um-hum um-hum um-hum that's the way with me i i worked four years one time bu[t]- but my last two children were uh both entering high school age and uh they were of course gone while i was w[orking]- working so it wasn't a problem i saw and i stayed home of the time i so i didn't have that problem either now i have my my oldest daughter she has two children and they've been in day care uh she works full time it it's difficult but yet she's the type of person that i don't know if she'd be happy staying at home uh-huh she uh she surprised me though she's done a lot of things that i never thought she would do you with the family because she the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children she uh she spends a lot of quality time i think when she is with with the children and uh sh[e]- they've used the day care most of the time they tried on[ce]- once they had a lady come in and uh she she also had a small child she brought with her and it did not work out uh at all it she thought it was going to she was real excited because_1 it was so much easier than taking the children out in the morning but uh uh the the lady called and her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble and this baby is the is the most pleasant uh real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually and and she was having problems with her and so she called and said things were okay settled down and was all right well my daughter decided to come and check and things weren't okay her son was watching the {soapies} which she doesn't allow them_1 to watch the {soapies} and the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out and the babysitter was in the kitchen with her baby and so that ended that episode uh she was most upset o[ver]- over finding this so uh she they kind of had decided that the day care was better there is uh more people involved more than one adult they and the age groups are separated and uh um-hum hum yeah story time uh and the this one has been particularly nice it uh it kept track of what they did and they would tell the parents what they did that day you know if they said anything or did anything so it kind of i[t]- kept it yeah i oft[en]- i always thought that if you were checking into a day care that you would be good to get references uh on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying you know if there was a problem they they would i think be more ready to tell you what it was they might not say any[thing]- and uh other than how else how do you judge other than from what others have uh what you see uh the cleanliness and that type of thing uh um-hum um-hum but it would be real difficult to pick y[ou]- you know to find one and decide um um-hum um um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah yeah uh it worked out good i'm going to i've decided i'm going to babysit my two granddaughters since they'll be going back at the end of the month and i'm going to give it a try i i i sell Avon and Stanley products and i've got that worked out my husband he's retired so he's going to deliver my products so i'll do my orders and that by phone so uh i'll be able to keep that up a little bit but i thi[nk]- i think i'll enjoy doing it yeah i i think i'll enjoy i i guess i kind of miss having a baby around a kid around or something yeah right that's right well they do say you enjoy them more uh some[body]- somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun they'd of had them first uh-huh uh-huh yeah my daughter always said she would not let me babysit because you do hear grandparents complaining you know because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much but they're the ones that complain a lot are the first	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

oh um let's see i uh i have enjoyed uh Thirtysomething in the past uh n[ow]- now that it has gone off uh some comedy shows uh i can't can't think of off hand of what what are your what is yeah yeah yeah uh yeah yeah we we we try to catch that most most nights yeah it it was kind of interesting uh some people complained about uh uh the kind of whining or whatever on it i- i- d[id]- i really did not think it was it was that way i think it had some some good uh good situations that it uh presented yeah well i think i think a lot of people you know kind of felt that way but they had a lot of uh uh uh counseling groups that used some of the episodes as as examples of of things that were going on and uh y[ou]- y[ou]- you know that the effect of interaction between people and sort of to use as uh as a way of getting people to talk about their problems that sort of thing uh we kind of uh uh our TV viewing has uh slowed down a little bit since our our daughter came along so uh that that tends to put a cramp in your viewing because by the time you get through getting her ready for bed and everything uh it's uh very little TV time left yeah yeah that's right no i- i- i can't uh i don't think there were uh i- i haven't i haven't uh uh there are not as many good shows that i that i continuously like to watch as much as i used to i uh you know there uh i used to could be able to name ten shows or so you know that i felt were worth my time to watch but uh i- i i very seldom like to watch there there's there's a there's a couple now that i tend to want to watch i like uh home improvement shows like Bob Vela's uh H[ome]- Home Again on Saturday morning it's enough it's like it's like This Old House but it's uh it's on instead of being on pub[lic]- PBS it's on regular TV but uh it's kind of interesting because_1 i they renovate an old house and yeah so uh i- i like to watch that uh some some things on PBS i like to watch but uh yeah if it's someb[ody]- if it's a team or something that i am really interested in i- i am not one to just watch a football game just to be just to be watching it or i am not a big basketball or baseball fan if it unless it's baseball if it's some if it's a team i really like i may watch but uh its uh baseball to me is a little hard to watch on TV for an extended period yeah its so slow that you just get bored i'll i'll switch between something else and and and a baseball game going back and forth you know watching it but i usually if if if it's a football team i really like a college team or or pro team that i'm fond of i usually will will sit and watch that but uh that's the yeah yeah it's kind of like foo[tball]- like baseball right i think that that that's um what more people are doing and i think that's you know as as TV i think that less good shows being on TV has caused a lot of people to do to do that uh you know to get more movies and watch i know we've we've done that too in the past uh we don't do it quite as much now because_1 huh our baby won't let us watch them_1 but uh uh you know we usually will we used to rent uh two or three movies on a weekend and and and try to watch no uh we live in no no we uh the uh development we moved into was they have it on on si[de]- like right across the street from us but when they built our section they didn't didn't put it in and we've been there about two years now and they're still still do not have it so i'm hoping that that soon they'll they'll they'll i have contacted them about this and they say that well it's it's they look they every year they look at different areas and try to determine where where uh the most houses will be and so they they look and they when they when we reach a certain number of people in that area they'll put one in put some in or they'll at least consider it so yeah um yeah yeah i've uh i've i've uh i have i put some put in some uh an antenna a really good antenna and uh it's really helped you know ours and it's not been too bad i have not really missed it that much there are certain things that i've that i want to see you know occasionally like like a foo[tball]- football game a college game or something that happens to be on cable or some old movie you know i- i haven't been bothered by it by it too much so right okay all right bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

uh yeah i i think so i i uh i i think i'm i think i'm uh a little out of the ordinary in that that i i uh i think i'm more worried about the deficit the national deficit than than uh a lot of other people are and think that we need to we need to either raise our taxes or or cutback on something and i don't know what to cutback on to to get to get that to get that settled and and uh and uh i know i'm a real a real uh out of it in terms of taxes so i'm not i'm uh think that the we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that uh for Texas and and yeah i think so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah now i'm uh uh you know i'd we'd when we moved to R[ichardson]- Richardson one of the reasons we chose it was for the uh for the schools and and realizing that that that that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to uh to go for that because we supported the yeah yeah yeah i think that's right yeah i don't i don't know about that i i i see okay no uh yeah well that that that would be true that would be true but huh yeah and and even if it is isn't going to uh uh provide you with any any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your your home to a business for instance you know yeah yeah and yeah and the other thing is that wh[en]- when it when it's the public transportation is established that early on then then the business uh business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that whereas in in uh in Dallas here we've we've got uh those patterns were well established before before we really tried to tried to do the DART and uh for instance all the all the the uh office buildings and stuff that are out here in in uh north Dallas as opposed to downtown uh to try to to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the the metroplex to to uh both those centers of of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area you know like New York does yeah yeah yeah right right yeah oh yeah yeah yeah right yep yeah yeah yeah a little bit much oh yeah yep yep yeah we c[ould]- yeah i th[ink]- i think so i think that will probably do it so good enough bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
okay what kind of pets do you have oh how cute are they very old oh so get got got one with a lot of puppies still in it do you train them_1 did you train them_1 do can they do tricks and stuff yeah oh really well my husband thinks he's married to Ellie May Clampitt yes we have four dogs and lots of fish and then uh where i live i have some wild rabbits that live outside so i consider them my pets too i go out and talk to them_1 and give them_1 you know things out of the refrigerator i do not know if they ever really eat any of it or not but uh my dogs are mainly just mutts they are they are all big though they are like half Lab and half Collie so i have big dogs and i had never had big dogs until i got married i had a little toy Poodle as i was growing up and my dad had bird dogs but you know i nor[mally]- i was used to having a little puppy that i could hold and snuggle and boy these big dogs are something else oh really yeah that's what one of my my m[y]- my male dog thinks he is a lap dog but uh it's real funny because_1 we have a water bed and one of my dogs is afraid of the thunder and so when it thunders she hits the water bed and like catapults you up it's a real treat no but it's real funny cause she's just big and she's real ferocious but boy if it thunders she is just like a little baby oh yeah it's real funny i got a book on you know how to train you dog to keep from being afraid of thunder but golly i had to quit my job and stay yeah oh uh-huh uh-huh really oh yeah huh really that's good do they p[lay]- get along real well with each other yeah well that's what my uh Dr Jim Humphrey's i watch his show sometimes and he said that dogs are pack animals and so they are a lot happier when they have a buddy to play with oh yeah oh yeah they have a big but it's really funny cause i mean you know obviously nobody plans to have four dogs but uh my husband had the two and then shortly after we got married the couple behind us had a dog that they just were tired of and they were going to have her put to sleep and she was just gorgeous and we said no we will take her and find her a home and we did and then the little one that or the the last one i guess i should say um my husband saw her get hit by a car so he loaded her up and brought her home thinking we'd find her a home and we did because_1 right now i am so attached to all of them_1 i could not get rid of one if i had to oh yeah yeah they are real fun we take them_1 pretty much everywhere i mean we have to God it costs us a fortune to board them_1 but um we go camping and they go with us and we have the best time it's difficult um they are all black and so i told my husband i said boy next time we are either going to get a black carpet or blonde dogs i said this is just too much and then people say when are you going to have children and we are like well we getting rid of dogs oh wow oh my gosh oh yeah uh-huh really yeah well my husband vacuums a lot especially when they are shedding oh really well now my dad just got a Schnauzer but i do not know i guess it's not considered miniature because_1 um it's what i consider normal size oh huh yeah well how big is big i mean like the size of a Collie big wow oh well then what daddy has must be a too because_1 it's yeah yeah huh well have you ever seen a Schnoodle i just love they were so cute oh really well the first time i saw one i just fell in love and m[e]- and Kyle just said like no we can't dogs i know yeah it just kills me to g[o]- i can't even go into a pet store because i want a puppy so badly and so it's real funny all my girlfriends say yeah everybody else is saying i want a baby and Jackie is saying i want a puppy no really oh wow oh but i just couldn't bear to give those puppies away oh oh yeah yeah oh really well that's neat yeah huh huh oh yeah oh yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay oh i guess so go by ear okay right oh wow uh we have a six percent sales tax yes uh-huh i don't mind my taxes as much as my social security yeah yeah um the taxes i don't know i can deal with that because i know everyone else is paying in i guess you know but uh oh i don't know uh the one thing that we don't have uh tax on clothes do you that's what i thought i know New York ha[s]- also has a sales tax on clothes and i know a lot of kids like going to college with me that lived in New York or out of state and a lot of them would buy their clothes in Pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that uh-huh no well we don't have it necessarily on food but then there's other things that they nail you for it like health and beauty products you know yeah yeah that would uh deduct yeah uh-huh uh-huh and see i take it she was an accountant yeah yeah uh-huh i know well i- i- i also was a student i just graduated in May and um i graduated with a finance degree but that was the big joke the accountants or the people who found ways to cheat on your income tax that was the big joke Clarion University uh-huh um-hum yeah uh-huh i think they should go back i- i realize you know that we have uh graduated tax brackets but i think they should still go back and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class i think the burden should be put more on the wealthy yeah yeah you know they always have the argument well you know well who's to say we don't work harder to get that you know well i don't care how much they take off of you you know you're still going to be above on top and i you know like you said i i've worked in different places and the ones that get the most pay do the least work uh-huh i agree with you i do think it's a lot of luck and i don't like that part of the finance you know whatsoever i don't know but like what i was saying about the social security that's real you know it never bothered me until we started talking about it in my classes and then the more i think about it the more i think i'm paying in to something that i granted you know i'm paying for my grandparents but i'm never going to see that social security is going to be gone before i ever get any um-hum right they're going to pay me fifty dollars a month i'm sorry i put in much more than that you know uh-huh right uh-huh oh yeah yeah yeah you you got to look to what they put you know you have decent roads at least yeah uh-huh that's true it's how you look at it too i like to instead of thinking how much you know that i'm paying out i like to just look at it and say oh well everyone else is doing it too you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well i- i tend to be a a uh sports news and uh not very many of the modern sitcoms what a[bout]- what about yourself yes um-hum well what i find is that outside of uh well sports because i'm a sports fan is the the ones that i do watch is uh Saturday Night Live except i- i wish they didn't have so many reruns and otherwise we're caught up with uh because we are pretty good at sitting down to dinner in the six to seven o'clock period uh good ole Wheel of Fortune which is uh an interesting combination of a a lot of luck and uh the it's probably as good a program as any for the audience to play along and see if you think you're smart or smarter then then those folks are uh i have a family that is very much into sitcoms and and i have to at six o'clock uh fight getting the news on versus uh having the channel changed on me because they want to watch Cosby or one of the other ones that running on one of the uh the off channels um-hum yeah certainly more educational than Wheel of Fortune uh-huh um-hum um-hum yeah i find that it seems to me and uh maybe this is as you get older i'm in my mid forties now but uh uh i guess from my vantage point i think the quality of TV has gone down or else my interests have changed because there were there were various series over the years that i would always make sure i watched and yet i find that now i'm there's hardly anything that that except Saturday Night Live that draws me to say i want to try to watch that i may watch something just because it's on but i uh i tend to go more to the educational channels if there's uh something that seems interesting there i just uh as i say don't find the modern sitcom very uh well just very appealing to my interests yeah yeah do you get A&E because that's one we don't have cable so uh there's a few things i miss because_1 i don't have cable and A&E is one whenever i'm on a business trip and they have it i find that it has things that are uh that interest me they have a lot of series uh i guess i'm into uh i'm a history buff so with all their reruns of uh the aviators over the ages and uh who built what planes and all that was uh that type of stuff interests me hum yeah i guess that varies from place to place being in the Dallas area because we have we have about seven without uh cable and then with cable who knows how many you can get seven seems enough uh i've read a little bit about it but uh i haven't i don't even know if it's running here in Dallas It kind of shows the level of interest i have in looking at the TV schedule what time's it on there um-hum uh-huh um-hum well they do but i[t]- it's amazing these days if something isn't making it the word of mouth uh of people talking to each other can cause a program which gets bad reviews to uh to uh not last for very long and even though they did invest money in it that they uh it's i think the comparison is like baseball managers this year they seem to uh say two weeks in uh you've had your chance time to uh since you aren't making it we're going to find somebody else well you know LA Law seems to be real hot and in fact because of the particular business i'm in i'm not a lawyer but i work with lawyers a lot and the lawyers seem to be very much into watching it and uh yet i again i have to say because of uh uh i have not watched very many episodes of it uh again it's i don't know what i do with my time but i certainly don't spend it watching uh TV in the evenings um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
there we go uh so uh what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary that week right um well um i uh right now i'm into a weird situation i'm a graduate student and uh uh i don't have that many benefits per se um sort of get yeah yeah my wife has a real job and i simply see from her angle um uh i think health insurance is real real important uh i've i've i've i've discovered i mean even in my case it's sort of they're really um a pain in the neck about it up here because the the university makes me buy a small they they have a mandatory they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance they offer insurance to everyone but then the basics that are major medical they they force you to buy here now i'm covered by my wife's anyway but i still pay them a hundred dollars a semester for uh mandatory so that's sort of annoying that i'm paying for something i'm not getting in that case i'd rather that that went to something else right i mean uh and and and it turns out that actually uh the benefits they you know that that hundred dollars sort of would would entitle me to go to the university health services here you know and and use them and it turns out that i do think they're v[ery]- they're excellent physicians there so through my wife's HMO we've registered for them as our primary care physicians so we go there anyway so they're they're so if they were to bill which which i believe they don't but if they were to bill the HMO for my business they could in in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing but they're not thank God um but anyway uh otherwise i i would imagine uh good vacation is is important although i don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job i don't you know oh wow so that's the real yeah i mean i don't you know i don't i know my wife uh i see she gets you know about two weeks a year i guess but they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off they you know usually let her yeah oh really no yeah that's oh that's a that's reasonable i think yeah weigh are see such of things yeah i think i was watching something the other day about that actually on uh a news special or something like that and they were saying how in some sense that that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes you know lowers the cost of everything and all insurance and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people you are talking to they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that so um-hum right at least us who decides right right you want to know that that that when you pick a doctor you know you you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about yeah that that's the	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay all the goodies an Oldsmobile had you owned Oldsmobiles before uh-huh uh-huh and you what just the memory of that made you go to Oldsmobile again or oh yeah um-hum um-hum you are you still driving that car how old is it now eighty five are you going to be looking again soon or how long do you normally keep cars for a long time or oh my uh-huh uh-huh oh my was it still under warranty or uh-huh uh-huh you put a lot of miles on a car or oh my for what almost six well six years huh um-hum um-hum well we don't we don't buy new cars that often we drive them_1 you know until they get maybe seven or eight years old and then we'll what we'll do is sell off we'll have one about seven say and one twelve or thirteen years and we'll get rid of it and then we'll buy a new one and and uh i guess right now we have a a seventy eight Chevy wagon and then a a four year old uh Crown Victoria that i love and uh-huh well my husband's my husband got to chose choose the make and then i got everything else he he he likes Fords and my youngest son still lives at home he's in in college but he drives an old Ford seventy seven Ford pick up that he loves but no i this was the last year they made the big Crown Victoria and before they started chopping it up and making it look ugly so i it loo[k]- i- i guess some people think it looks boxy but always like to to have a room in a car i'm not into compacts i like something you can relax in right well that's not that's a good choice for a child i think to start to start to drive in our oldest one started in a old Datsun of ours but our second one uh bought a real old i- i guess it was a Olds ninety eight but it was one that was still metal before and we she was such a nervous driver we felt like she's probably better if anything did happen she was going to be all right but not well just for safety's sake and i don't know i- i look at the new ones on the market now and the the bodies are so sleek i guess for wind resistance you know and and uh they just don't look like they're roomy inside i guess they are i haven't been looking at them to oh really uh-huh is it supposed to seat six uh okay a lot of knee room in the back or um-hum yeah right right well i e[ven]- even in our car i know like when my husband and my sons and sons-in-law all have long legs they're tall people and so if one of like my husband's driving then he soot scoots his seat back and so we can't put a we can't put a tall person with long legs behind him so it oh my word yeah you're like my son-in-law yeah no that's so you can't then then like i could sit in back because i'm only five four so my legs fine back there but you couldn't put a a real long legged person back there comfortably right w[ell]- well yeah i wonder sometimes you know we have the Dallas Mavericks here that play and they'll show them sometimes on TV and they've all got these real low sports cars and i well i've never been in one so i but i'm always wondering how on earth somebody six seven Corvette yeah well even to get out of it though i mean you're you're only a foot off the ground at the most and it's got to be you know you can't get your leg out and so i- i thought i always you always see them standing by it you know if they're advertising they don't ever show them getting in and out and i thought i that's the part i'd like to see in or out right well listen i never had a car that's had the swivel seats that where you can like when you're wanting to get out you just turn it to the side and then your feet are and and i don't even know if they i know for a while back i saw them advertise that and i thought that might be kind of a neat a neat thing to have but i- i for some reason they don't carry them and i don't know if they found they were unsafe or you know maybe to do that they had couldn't make them where they were just real stable one thing our d[oes]- our car doesn't have that i'd look for in another car is that that little gutter like it runs so that when you open the door the water doesn't the it doesn't have that so when you open our car door it comes the new the new one does so they i guess that's the year they learned that's not a good idea because it just comes right off the roof and straight down and just you know i try to put an umbrella up there but that doesn't help too much it just so i get the interior wet and i don't like to do that just along the side there well i- i don't know we how many inches do you all average a year how many inches do you average a year you just have had a lot is it is it uh a kind of a dirty rain you know i i've never been down in there but you always here how polluted with all the oil it's not it's not well i- i didn't course oh it is up here too it is everywhere but with all the oil right right that's where i was thinking of that doesn't that doesn't affect ah then you don't have any trouble with the water or oh my well i just i- i don't know i you know i just hear that when you read about Houston seems like they're course all their advertising or not advertising but news reporting is maybe an oil refinery blowing up or something like that you don't ever i- i need to get down that way i guess sometime when i retire see what they have i know uh-huh uh-huh hum hum yeah i that was where they had when the economy went bad a couple years back they had all the limousines for such good buys we had one of our principals at our of a school here in Plano an elementary school went down and bought one i think she paid eighteen or twenty and they tease her is this you know to see her drive up everybody wonders who it is it was just a well they they just said you can you know the limousine companies were going out of busy and and you could pick one up for for a real good buy and they had supposedly in Houston they had a lot of them_1 so i thought well that i don't know we even debated about that at that time but decided no that wasn't the that wasn't the route when our kids were little we had a van which we loved for for traveling we had four kids and they just that allowed them to really move around	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay what do you think about the school systems uh-huh right okay what do you see as being a problem with the school system uh-huh oh uh-huh uh-huh yeah well i don't have children in school and it's been so long since i was in school myself i'm not really sure how to answer that when uh i don't know it seems that they're you know that that the difference is between each school i think if it was if it could possibly be standardized a little bit that it would be much easier to to gauge you know how uh a particular group of students was doing uh the curriculums differ so much and i'm not saying that that's bad necessarily but i think it makes very hard to tell where an actual problem is you know you can't really tell from a group of students if it's a if if it's the the teacher that's got the problem or if it's the book that's got the problem you know what the materials that they're using and everything that could be causing a problem uh-huh what kind of school is that oh okay yeah i think that's kind of a good idea because you know it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't divide people by by anything besides what they're interests are and it's a mu[ch]- high[er]- it's a learning environment if you're grou[p]- if you're interested in sciences and you're grouped with other people that are interested in sciences it seems like it would it would uh it would help yeah uh-huh okay what do you think about about sports in high school and about uh the competitiveness i've i've know i've seen in Plano that there's a lot of really vicious competitiveness between the children at the different high schools and do you think that's healthy uh-huh yeah uh-huh oh yeah uh-huh oh okay uh-huh uh-huh now i didn't even realize that at all um right huh well i know they've got a lot of elementary schools well now what is Shepton going to be okay okay um yeah that does seem kind of different	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah i do oh really did you plant those yourself oh uh-huh oh that's nice oh i love blackberries and we w[e]- uh when i was smaller we my family lived in Tennessee and there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick my brother and i but i don't have any down here oh i think i know what they i can't remember what the name of them i[s]- a[re]- are either oh down here the grass well i'm uh we've had problems with our yard we it was one big weed is what it was it was just horrible and my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns and we have this God awful ugly thing and and i know they must think you know i wish those people would do something about their yard but my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff that that seems to be helping and he put it on the front yard to see how you know it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard but we've got a Great Dane in the back and she has eaten everything i have put out there she's eaten my crepe myrtle trees i know and she's eaten the bushes i've tried to i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there and i barricaded it up so she couldn't get into it and i went and took a shower and looked back out there and she was already in it and i was so mad so i can't do anything back there because_1 she just she destroys it but i've tried out in the front but like you said that that freeze that came i had some bushes that uh some shrubs i pu[t]- put out front and it killed those too so uh i'm i'm just real discouraged with the whole thing i just don't even want to do anything i yeah that that happened to us we have these i know oh i know ours don't i know we can't either but i've got pre[tty]- two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard uh you know one on either side of the yard a[nd]- and they're big and they're real full and everything you know in the summer time but it it's killing everything underneath where the leaves are shading the tree but toward the end of the summer you know when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing but by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops you know it's just it's a never ending cycle yeah it really is so we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and and whatnot so uh-huh huh yeah really and i've cut well i don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front and they've got mini-blinds and stuff but only only one is really like in the flower bed part and the other one is out on the porch so there's not really much i can do about that yeah i do too that's why i look at my neighbors yard i don't have anything to look at so i look at theirs uh-huh yeah yeah it it's really a pain my husband works a lot so um a lot yeah i'm it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard and and i just i really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it i hate to mow the yard more than anything else i hate to mow that yard yeah well mine's getting there he helps he does half and i do half so pretty soon though by next year he should be able to do it all by himself whether he likes it or not oh sure i'll be more then glad to pay him if he'd just go out there and do it and and do it to where i don't have to go back out and redo it that that's my only thing with him that's why i'm help having him help me now	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay do you subscribe to magazines yourself oh i see i get uh McCalls of course anything that appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest and then once in a while i'll pick up a Working Woman or something and realize why i don't want to re[enter]- go back to work what i enjoy about staying home and uh i read magazines mainly because they're fast and if i wanna relax while i watch TV of course i'm one of those that does two things at once and uh i read Good Housekeeping and Better Homes and McCalls and i like them_1 because they're kind of short and to the subject uh-huh and then you stopped them_1 all i find that um about two years is probably my max on subscribing to one in particular and then i kind of get turned off by it other than Good Housekeeping Good Housekeeping is the one that kind of sets around for when um when i'm really have time and really wanna read something you know and i don't get into books too often because i have so many things that i stay occupied with uh on a general basis and we travel a lot so i enjoy reading parts on travel in the various uh you know different ones and i get into uh newspapers so th[at]- i guess that kind of tells you what kind of person i am i'm uh rea[d]- read it fast and put it right well that's what i do you clip recipes and you save them_1 forever and you never and then s[o]- every so often you weed through them_1 and think where did i ever put that recipe but uh that's mainly my uh whole idea on you know short subject uh reading and things like this i i subscribe like i said to a few and once in a while i buy that new magazine called First on the newsstands or something like that but i kind of stay with my own subject matter of what uh pertains to my daily life at the present time right uh well sometimes if you know if you're in transportation in public transportation i know that people'll read them_1 on something like that but i think and the idea is to is and good i can just dump them_1 at the have to carry them_1 back with me i do that when we travel i always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we drive or wherever we no matter what it is air travel or anything and i right al[though]- although now you really now see your computer ones i got into computer work somewhat uh we have our own computer system at home and i tried uh reading the magazines hoping i would get more from it and it was just above my head without having someone there to give me the advice as i went along it was you know kind of a little bit more than what i needed so i never did get into them i when i bought the computer all of a sudden i was receiving them for some unknown reason through the mail i think they all said thought well we have a live one she'll but they were wrong i never got into them but uh okay all right i guess we might as well end our conversation at this point it was nice talking with you okay um-hum bye now	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well course my favorite team there is the Texas Rangers so i watch them all the time and who do you watch the Mets this isn't their best season is it well the Rangers are the few games behind Minnesota but if we could win the next oh i guess we'd win have to win most all of them we could still go to the to the race to do the well i watched the two games the last two nights so oh is that right pardon i think they're out six and so they have to still win almost every single game that they have to play to the end now or else yeah yeah i don't know Minnesota's won a good game they're they're doing a good job this year i don't know they really but i'm gonna watch tonight because Nolan Ryan's gonna pitch so i always like to watch him pitch yeah um-hum well uh we just traded Buechele and i really liked him but b[ut]- he's gone now so i i guess uh Sierra i like to watch him bat yeah he's he's really good Franco's good except that uh he's got injuries right now his hamstring's down in the bottom of his legs he can't run very well but it he usually hits then he just trots around the bases it's okay and um yeah well they've moved him now since he can't move that quickly since it hurts him they moved him to second base and they moved Petralli into that area in that runs now in between the shortstop area and he takes second base um Sierra let's see yeah Sierra's into is he middle field or left field he's not left field he must be center field do you oh now what's that i don't know what that is oh oh oh yeah that's hard um no not too not too much i- i guess i just don't watch them that much um i like to watch the Oakland A's play they have a lot of good players too but i haven't watched them for a while so i don't know how they're doing too well this season um once every so often mostly Rangers games come on because that's our area but um every once in a while on a Saturday or a Sunday they'll put a another league on you know but it's it just depends how to you know how they fill the time sometimes anyway i um we got what oh is it oh well that's kind of fun yeah uh isn't it's a fun thing i think you'll like it it's a it's a old thing to do and um anyway we just uh if you get run out of things to say then you say good bye it was nice talking to you too and have a good day um bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
hi um basically i wear pants i'm a real pants person and um like when i'm at home since a[nd]- and i'll say i'm a homemaker since that's my basic thing um i wear a pantsuit most of the time not a pantsuit i guess pants and a shirt and um in the summertime i wear cotton tops cotton top shirts and in the winter i wear uh like sweaters i like sweaters a lot and so i do that but when i go out for meetings uh then i will wear either uh skirts or um a dress and i have a couple of pantsuits because_1 those are real in at this time but that's basically what i do oh um-hum right well that sounds nice um it said the seasons do do you change much through the season or uh-huh maybe uh-huh yeah yeah right uh-huh then maybe yeah um well i don't have the resources to just go out and buy buy buy anyway and so my note change dramatically over the years if i need something new i will go and buy it but basically i'm a a pretty much the same in the summertime i wear the light cotton and in the wintertime i change to the sweaters and so it's not a whole lot of of change for me either and um especially when i go to the meetings and wear the dresses i i i enjoy that but it just wouldn't be um smart for me to do that in my home with my children so i have to um think about things like that too i have given seminars before in in creative writing and things like that now i don't know if they consider that a job i don't really get paid for that uh often but uh when i do that then i i think i become more businesslike um but it doesn't really change in my clothing style yeah yeah oh uh-huh oh dear that's not helpful yeah i guess so well it's been great talking to you have a great day bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay did um all the scale is from one to ten i think one being um no or i'm sorry is a[ll]- total control and then ten as being no control is that what it was okay_1 so that would be like less control i i'm confused but i don't really think it matters but okay more control okay_1 and why is that um-hum um-hum um-hum i don't either um-hum huh um-hum gosh i've never done uh-huh uh-huh um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum where it's a like cool down if they're just like in the bad uh-huh i agree um that's why i'm i guess i'm like five in the middle because because like if i like i say if someone tried to break into my house today i would wanna get a gun that day you know f[or]- to help be protected or whatever that night but i wouldn't want some crazy nut that you know gets mad at somebody else and says i'm gonna kill them to be able to get a gun that fast so it's like a double-edged i guess so hm hm but i've never i don't know if i've ever shot a gun i don't oh you have to that's neat um-hum huh um-hum um-hum who but you wanted like slightly more rules like um like you're towards the conservative end um-hum um-hum i was just wondering because_1 like since i've never shot one maybe it's different if you've actually shot one or like you said hunted or you know maybe if you know had ever shot one uh-huh uh-huh um-hum huh um-hum hm what kind of hunting have you done hm hm um-hum hm because_1 like i have friends that hunt and um but they're like real careful they kill the animal with like one shot so they don't have like a injured animal running around and um-hum hm oh my God does that have to be like some heavy duty bullet to be able to do that or some real super gun or hm um-hum oh my gosh hm um-hum um-hum um-hum oh my did she die or hm um-hum um-hum um-hum hm gosh i'd uh wouldn't wanna live near a uh-huh really are you still in the service or	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well basically uh did you wanna go first then okay right um-hum sure uh-huh yeah i think as far as like our home is uh in a small residential area and we're out of the cities quite a ways so it's kind of more of a country setting and uh it's just a typical um three bedroom type of home it's it's nothing you know elaborate where it has uh this or this or you know it's it's just a typical home with uh three bedrooms uh two story type home and um and i think as far as if it if we're put it into standards of uh what other homes are around here it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are um there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes and yet there's where we can view the river from that distance there's still homes within our area that are you know pretty typical of what our home is so it's uh pretty much that uh type of um home so uh uh-huh oh really hm sure uh-huh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah um-hum so it's a rambler style um-hum yeah yeah it's kind of like what ours is uh our one of our bedrooms is really small and we've made that into a den because we only have one child so that was our best way of going with uh the small bedrooms because_1 they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller it seems like they get um but uh anyway but okay_1 that sounds great and uh i don't know if we need to talk anymore or whatever the TI um yes uh about three times a[nd]- so i'm fairly new to it but it seems to be going okay no huh-uh no i'm out of state i'm in Wisconsin so yeah yeah so its um other than that sure yeah is this your first time uh-huh i'm the always the one that initiates the calls because i kind of like it because_1 it's like i can get it done i don't have to wait until somebody called me even though i have a feeling what's gonna happen is i'll probably get tons of calls you know so sooner or later uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah yeah sure yes okay well you take it easy Gail um-hum bye now	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so have you done any painting projects lately oh really what kind of painting was it uh-huh it was it yeah oh huh uh-huh oh w[ell]- what kind of paint did you use for the um bookends uh-huh so you can't use oil on wood oh so you had to go around with paint all over you temporarily anyway oh oh is that what you usually use in the house is latex hm uh-huh yeah heard about that i guess a friend of mine had a uh um well she she just started up a day care center and uh an[d]- the one of the real strict uh restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff so uh she had that done but uh well um so to speak i had to paint this uh the inside of this warehouse thing uh that you keep some um farm equipment in and um what i had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer and uh i had this big five gallon jug and it was like paint thinner i mean i you know it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner but uh you just took a roller and put it on there and uh if you saw that the wood was getting wet you know that was that was all you needed so yeah it was it used all of it i guess it was about three hundred yards worth so well i guess it worked out it was pretty easy actually well what about the trim in your house did you have to do that uh-huh um-hum oh yeah did you have uh one coat or two um-hum yeah that would be really time a a time saver um-hum oh me i would've had to have taped the whole thing and then brushed around the edges and and then i'd have probably rolled it on i'd uh it would've taken me forever yeah well the first time it'd probably would've {tooken} me forever so well how long did it take y'all um-hum so there was two of y'all well that's easy enough um i think i could probably do it uh as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then i could do it um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
now then i think that are you there all right do you have any one that has been in a nursing home oh yes well what do you think can be done about that i mean what can we do well i can remember of course i'm old enough to remember when the family or the church took care of all of this we did not have to call on on someone else and i feel no you tell me how you yeah certainly d[id]- i worked with an agency in West Texas that they it's where they really started this concept of Meals On Wheels and i think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly if they didn't have to you know go into a kitchen my mother just just a little over a year ago and we had finally she didn't wanna live with either my sister or me but we be got found a retirement center for her and it was beautiful and they had all these they didn't even have nursing care there so until as long as mother was you know mobile and got her foo[d]- and she was with people with whom she enjoyed sure yes sir yeah being a widow i find that eating alone is one of the hardest things i have to do i have just recently retired and i am finding it extremely hard to adjust to so uh mother had the little kitchenette and she could do all these fine things that she just ha[d]- had a microwave had to pop her popcorn now this is wonderful but when it came time for a full meal then mother was able to go with people and and enjoy it oh i think so t[oo]- well	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
question was on lawn and garden work um how do you like it ooh what kind do you have do they really oh oh and i know somebody that lives there and they never mentioned that oh my they probably just take it for granted then ooh yuck no i- i don't have that problem uh it's mine is mainly we kind of have an understanding that uh i- i said i'll do inside work you do outside work and so i get into the gardening part of it the fun part like putting in the annuals and things like that but i don't like i don't getting dirty no i don't know we got th[e]- we got the question and i thought oh this is gonna be interesting uh two bits i'll get a man to get stuck doing it all but although i do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work and this year we put in a new lawn in a new home so um we've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall today we just had a lot of rain yeah so it's kind of nice i don't know how yours has been oh i see okay well w[e're]- we're leaving tomorrow and we're going down to New Orleans and from Ohio since we're right near Lake Erie this is gonna be a switch for us for a week going down there and i think we'll probably experience some of your weather although i think they have more humidity but um as far as the gardening and things like that goes i don't know uh too much too much about uh how much i really r[eally]- do enjoy it myself do you like it at all well how about_1 when you were in Colorado uh-huh well and then a[nd]- too now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly my water bill was high and uh if you have that on regular basis in Texas i think i would go with something very dry to k[eep]- keep it off but uh and with children um you probably don't have time anyhow to to get into it it's so uh okay very good i guess we've kind of covered our subject matter since right okay right nice talking with you um-hum bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay so you're into microwave cooking and tha[t]- yes and that's what we all are looking for isn't it something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work i've gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the weekends so that i have leftovers all week um-hum i know i try not to make too much it's just my husband and i too and i try not to make so much that it lasts more than that but uh i usually i usually like to make spaghetti or soup or chili or you know something like that or sometimes a roast but what's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party oh uh-huh ooh that sounds delicious um-hum we i end up with an old standby that we call Russian chicken because it's so easy and uh it goe[s]- you have to cook very little to go with it just some rice and some salad and that's about it you know uh you make you just take your boneless chicken breasts and then you take and make a a dressing out of uh Russian dressing one bottle of that and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix and three ounces of apricot preserves and you mix it up and you just put it on the top of the chicken and then i cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour and then i take the foil off and let it brown takes about another twenty minutes and it's delicious and it's so simple because i can pop it in when i come in the door you know and then uh go about my business and by the time i've got everything else ready the chicken's rea[dy]- chicken's done so that's a real easy thing for me um-hum oh really no i don't my mom gets that but really um-hum hm hm oh my goodness um-hum well i love cheesecake i have never been i don't know the ones i have made i have not done that well with i like a baked cheesecake you know i don't i've had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it you know but that's not the same as a a New York style cheesecake and uh the recipes that i've used everybody will say oh this is real simple and then i make it and it's it's really not very good but yours sounds good i bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness hm well that sounds interesting so there's your good dessert for your dinner party are you into serving wines with your dinner party me either i wish i knew more about it um-hum um-hum they would be if you just had time to do it um-hum um-hum well how neat um-hum hm well i didn't even know they were offering that i guess i um-hum oh well i bet that'd be a fun thing to do	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay while i was waiting for you to connect i- i thought of a couple of menus i decided it'd to be if it's informal or not you know if it was informal i'd probably choose something i mean just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill because_1 that's a lot of fun especially this time of year where it's so nice out um it was formal i'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something i'm not i'm not into formal dinner parties but i'd probably go with lasagna a green salad and garlic bread um i have a Pillsbury cookbook i got when i was married but it's kind of the bible of cooking for me then i have some from like church that are more family recipes that are more useful you know budget cookbooks but and of course you get a lot from when you're growing up um i cook a lot the same as as my mom did of course i've added several different recipes but what would you serve or what would you well that's good um-hum uh-huh huh yeah that would be wonderful in these times yeah either they're really fast or uh-huh uh-huh what's one of your favorites uh-huh wow sounds pretty good yeah yeah those Thirty Minute Cookbook that sounds fun i find a lot of the cookbooks that i don't know that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients or things i don't keep on hand all the time and i have young children and our budget's set you know at this time but i want to use simple recipes that i have things on hand i don't have to run to the store to buy or look for something i haven't heard of so that's why sometimes i shy away from uh more of a traditional cookbooks but but well it was interesting talking to you it's a fun subject food is one of my favorite things too anything else you wanted to add oh wow um-hum um-hum that's good uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh that sounds good that sounds really good it sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than i am i'm pretty simple right now but yeah that's probably that's true i have little and we and they won't eat you know too many different foods right now so yeah yeah spaghetti's a pretty staple every other week or so so and it goes a long ways too so all righty we'll talk to you later maybe	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

do you see anything wrong with public school systems i agree yes and i taught for fourteen years before we moved to Texas and the the one thing i see is changing is i was held accountable so much i had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms for all the children everything had to be documented and i had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids it was filled with documentation yes me too i think so too they're so worried about lawsuits and the scores that children get on tests now and teacher competency you know and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best she's always worried whose looking over her shoulder and that's right i know that's right do you have children in the system ah yep are you in Plano yep i am too and i have one in ninth grade at Clark and one at Hendrick this year and he my nin[th]- my uh sixth grader came from an open classroom at Matthews and the very first year i taught back in seventy three we had open classroom and it didn't work then and when we moved down here i was just appalled that they were still doing it here partitions or just to face the children different directions or to do something i know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school so he spent all day in this one large open area so i didn't really care for that it seems like the schools in Michigan were much better than they are down here that was our last tour up in Michigan oh um-hum oh wow yes yes that's right we heard wonderful things about it till we actually got in the system probably so on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are so as a freshman yep yeah my daughter seems to be having a good time she was absent with strep throat the last three days and i ran over and picked up her report card and she did very good so and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of homework i would expect for a freshman to have she's not bogged down but yet she has some every night yes you always hear how good now my son's at junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful but who knows what he's going to bring home so i don't	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do i'm i'm a putterer i chose that topic because i really like gardening as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard oh um-hum we've had a late fall it seems like the weather in fact today it's really warm and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up but you know you need to pretty soon oh uh-huh uh-huh um-hum so now you have the chance to really create and and spread out um-hum the grass not growing so fast oh hm ours seems to have slowed down here we're not having to mow every week religiously but we're still fighting bugs and ready to change some of the the summer flowers out i still have caladiums that are pretty which is a surprise this late in the year uh-huh but like today it's eighty five degrees it's really strange but that'll change real quick then we'll wished we'd planted bulbs and pansies already oh my gosh well Texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants because our summers are so terribly hot and we have ice storms every year and there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings um-hum well for the most part we don't but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold well the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter but the the ice storms really are stressful on all the the plants that we have around we've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to and uh pittosporum that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time you you really take a chance with them freezing uh-huh um-hum except for the lack of trees out where we are it was all cotton fields and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful we really miss it um-hum hm um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
well i did hear the end of the prompt this time was that you that we didn't hear the whole prompt and it said that what what do we do we think that cri[me]- certain crimes should fit certain punishments and uh i was thinking about it after i got off the phone that that i really you know wish that there was some way to uh send a message to people you know about um child abuse and things like that that uh those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment too often i feel that people get off uh without um-hum um-hum right right yeah um-hum yeah well sometimes they even wonder when when uh criminals plead temporary insanity for for punish[ment]- for crimes that are so severe and then you know they get sent to a mental institution and they play loony for a while and then they're back out in public yeah yeah oh i agree i agree because we um-hum yeah yeah well and too you know they can always be blaming the other person well she looked like my mother who abused me when i was a child or something which i think is unfortunate for that person and yet shouldn't be an excuse i guess you know a lot of and i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some Miss America was abused by the man she loved and is that the new i just happened to see the headline on it and i didn't couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what but i thought uh you know if these things if children are being abused i i'm wondering how our school system is failing that they're not even seeing this you know if it was that severe that when they're later in life adults that it's all of a sudden affecting them in this way that it wasn't shown up at all when they were younger and that kind of that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having you know to to deal with that yet but still never and i lived in California which i feel like California you know anything can go on in California yeah um-hum um-hum i really would have no idea i uh i don't don't really know um-hum that would be pretty lenient in my opinion yeah that's that or like when uh i've heard when i	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well i've been real um thinking i'd love to buy a new car right now if i could afford it but we have two cars right now and we're still paying on but i would love to have one of these new minivans i've got two little ones and i think that would be just the perfect family car well what is it oh yeah we have um we have we went out to buy an American car so we bought um a Chevy Nova about three years ago and then we opened up the the hood and it said Toyota made in Japan right across the front of all the engine um-hum Toyota uh well the Chevy Nova is the same car as the Toyota Camry uh at that time was the same car so they just put different names on them_1 depending on who they're being shipped to i thought that was pretty in[sensitive]- yeah um-hum um-hum that's why we were so surprised to see Toyota written i mean imprinted on the engine it was real interesting but uh i with so many options now available you know where where cars are concerned it just seems like there is there's almost too much of a choice anymore you know that there's so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever i think that if i were really serious about looking for another car i would take into consideration the price naturally but um you know i would really want something that i would want for that much money for ten or twelve or fifteen thousand dollars or whatever oh yeah definitely i cannot imagine that you know somebody i heard a commercial or something about a sixty thousand dollars car about oh oh it would how exciting it is to make that kind of a purchase and i thought i don't think i'd find that exciting i'd be wondering you know here i am buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money that's true yeah yeah well we got a pretty we bought our Chevrolet brand new and then we bought a used car <b_aside> just a minute i'll change your diaper <e_aside> the we bought our our next car used and uh we had better luck with our used car and i like it more it cost us less money and we got more features and air-conditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for twice as much money if you can find one that's r[eliable]- uh you know reliable if you can get someone that you trust to buy one from or you know make sure that you can have it checked out well enough uh i wouldn't yeah that's we bought one like that uh-huh we bought one car that way and had we bought it real reasonably and it was in real nice condition so because_1 apparently whatever the bank get	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um i do what d[o]- what do you think about them_1 yeah definitely i have one right now and um i just got it about eight six months ago and i find that i[t]- it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldn't get yeah oh my goodness really that's good y[eah]- yeah i'd i made a rule with myself when i got one that if i couldn't pay it in full every month that i'd have to rip it up so that's yeah that um-hum i have i have a couple friends too that have about_1 three of them_1 {maxed} out and they they can't do anything but work to try to pay them_1 off and and and like one of my friends she has hers is up to nine hundred dollars and she doe[s]- she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because_1 she's going to school and and so i mean that's just enough to pay rent and buy like five dollars worth of food a month so and and pay for her like like monthly fee like twen[ty]- yeah you ha[ve]- i guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the so all she's paying is interest on hers every month it just seems crazy to to me but yeah oh really was it Visa card oh my goodness i bet yeah i'm i don't know i'm about_1 sick of mine right now i don't um-hum right exactly yeah my parents are really good about not using credit cards they are against it i don't think they like the fact that i have one either um-hum yeah hm yeah i'm nine[teen]- i'm twenty right now so just going to school and and working so it does kind of get in when you want something that like last weekend was homecoming and i needed a pair of shoes so i just went out and bought them_1 and on my credit card i didn't didn't have the money to do it yep it sure is so do you just have two kids or oh really neat i'm from Plano Texas but right now i'm out in Provo Utah going to BYU so yep yep but this is a extra long one hey they're giving us a lot of time yeah have you done a lot of this oh really do you do it every day wh[at]-	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yes uh have you seen any recently or um we just went out to one about couple weeks ago it was Necessary Roughness the one that was filmed in Denton yeah it it was pretty good but i- i don't know if if you saw this and you weren't in Dallas or around Texas if you'd understand some of it yes i don't know if it'd be good if you were outside of Texas but oh really well that's good i[t]- i[t]- yeah that's good um let's see yeah that's what it is uh-huh yeah and and that's good um that's pretty much what it was about it was just uh you know a a comedy you know just a a football team that was bad and come up you know and uh we just moved here from South Dakota and uh Dances With Wolves was filmed up there when we were there um-hum and we saw that where they f[ilmed]- they filmed it in Pierre South Dakota and that's where we went to see it um yeah they the buffalo and all that on the ranch um my father-in-law owns a plane and he um took us to the buffalo ranch and where they you know use the buffalo to film and and uh took us out there and you never knew that there was so much land that was not developed you know until you go you know and see that yes but um yeah it's nice it is it's like thirty now you know it's between thirty and forty and we we've just moved here and we call people back there and they just can't believe that we're still wearing shorts and is that when it starts changing uh-huh uh-huh okay yeah they've had two already two freezes so and so and that was a really good movie and it lasted three hours yeah it['s]- it's really long but i don't kn[ow]- it didn't feel like it was that long but after you got out and thought oh wow it was longer but um Kevin Costner was really good in that oh i think he's great um-hum he's you know done uh i can't remember now but the baseball show um yes Field of Dreams and have you seen Robin Hood with him in it or i haven't either and i've heard that's just great um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah it's probably been out for you know like a month now yeah yeah um no huh-uh i don't think it's out on video yet i still think it's at the theaters but um uh-huh well oh and see that's how we've you know we come out of it going yeah we come out of it going you know it's it's hard you know for us you know it was a good movie it interpreted what happened then but it brought out a lot that isn't going on now that they again felt that they were you know being so mistreated and and a[nd]- yes and it was not what we mean now you know uh-huh um-hum because_1 that's quite a deal you know being up in there in South Dakota where we have to pay the government funds to them and keep the tribes going and and you know it it hurts me because you know i have to keep paying this but yet i don't feel that i did anything to them but you know we have to keep doing this and you know right and how they lived right and and how they lived is very different from what we try to do now and and i feel that we're not working with territory or things like that now that we're overpowering somebody's territory or something like that now but but um you know i've i've seen a lot of Julia Roberts movies i do too	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay we're talking about capital punishment how do you feel about that Lenore well wonderful i am too one hundred percent um-hum all your life huh uh-huh there's no deterrent that's right there's just no deterrent and so many of those kind of people uh they got they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway so you know unless they really make it rough on them_1 that's not a going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i don't think right well i don't know what the Oklahoma's laws are but Texas is i don't know our i don't know it's it's no ones f[ault]- i mean it's not the judges fault i don't think it's just the way the law is down here man our cr[imes]- our uh prisons are so crowded that uh they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two well that's what ours did same thing uh-huh uh-huh um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum it's not here either really i do too and and you know but the way the courts are set up they've they've got so many chances for appeal but i think th[at]- i think it needs to be expedited you know if they've been convicted and given them_1 appeal and they're still convicted of of a crime that's deserving of of a lethal injection let's do it and not waste so many years to do it that's right um-hum um-hum yeah that's right somehow it just doesn't it works and then again it takes too long for it to work um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah yeah it it w[as]- i do too i think that needs to and i don't see why it couldn't be shortened considerably but you know ye[ah]- that's true it is overcrowded because there's so much drug uh problem with the people on drugs because_1 that they with the drugs they're they're robbing and killing and uh that's why it's filled the prisons up so much i think no it doesn't yeah that's true with all these lawsuits and people suing people over th[ings]- ridiculous things but boy haven't that we though we really have but anyway i'm glad to hear that you agree with me on the i'm i'm very {muchly} for it always have been always will be it could be supportive it it's it's supported with facts though it could very easily be supported with facts	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i punched it do you really wh[at]- what do you do oh yeah oh okay well that's great and you don't do any[thing]- things aerobic um-hum um-hum oh i know it that's pretty boring really your in you and Doug you and Doug oh that is great that you have it right there well i love getting outside so that's i mean it's real relaxing to me to just to get out and walk or whatever most of the time i walk yeah that's i walk and uh usually with a neighbor and uh and we walk about two and a half miles so um yeah right and that oh oh i don't either i i i like to walk if i have to walk inside i don't mind going to um the oh is it Plano Center or whatever right uh-huh now that's nice but it's not like being outside i agree and um so i d[id]- only did that in the wintertime but um anyway i'm i'm just thankful to get to do it when i get to do it i tell you um i sometimes i'll get home you know at least a couple a days a week and be able to on the during the weekdays and try to on the week[ends]- weekends too well h[ow]- how long do we have to talk have we talked the three minutes i know we're not supposed to talk but oh oh i agree uh because i have done wh[at]- but now i have to say though that if i didn't exercise i'd weigh more um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum you can um-hum {weightwise} yeah oh i a[gree]- i really do think the eating makes the big difference but um and you have to exercise i think for a long period of time that's what Doug uh always gives up t[oo]- too soon before it really starts feeling the real benefits from it but no i meant uh months yeah i mean regularly for months because um uh the first time i started ru[nning]- i used to run and i ran for six months with these friends and after that i s[tarted]- i really saw the difference i i only did it before then because it was just fun to meet them and go run and uh but after that i i mean i changed sizes i didn't lose much weight but i changed sizes and um and i really could see a difference i could see a difference when i played tennis and that kind of thing you know just had much more stamina and and all that but um-hum um-hum yeah when you get back y[ou]- i- i know that helps me a lot coming i[n]- in from school to go out because i don't think i can possibly do it and then i do it and i- i feel better because_1 th[en]- otherwise i'd come in and sit down and then i feel like i can't get up um-hum um-hum oh i really am in fact um i'd the last two weeks i'd i was uh i talked to Lynn yesterday afternoon because i had to talk to her about something else and i was telling her i said gosh i- i just don't know if i should sing in this thing or not because i missed the last two weeks and so if i come Wednesday night and Saturday do you think i can do it and i have the tape i'm been trying to and earnestly listen to it better lately but um i had a program on Thursday night before the one two weeks ago and just had a horrendous week and i was just so stressed it wasn't even funny and i just could not possibly make it that that Wednesday and then this last Wednesday Doug had a TI event you know uh where the wives went and that i i really needed to go with him not many things like that happen that we have to go to like you know where the wives have to go and so and it was good that i went but um anyway i hated missing two times	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
feel about um the Russian situation right now um-hum um it is very unstable right now right yeah i'm it's really scary because_1 i you know i i had a conversa[tion]- or i heard it over a conversation that they had with Gorbachev on the news stating that he needs to get you know like a United States set up over there because they're not gonna make the winter without the food and the electricity and if they d[on't]- if if people don't have food and electricity they're gonna go after it somehow and they're and they're gonna fight it out instead of doing it calmly like he's trying to have done now um i went over to the Soviet Union uh about three years ago and it was very sad they i[t]- the economy over there is very poor um oh yeah and when we went over there we were not allowed you know off this bus or you know into the you know onto the streets or anything like that well when i went i did and i got out and um um you know we barely got back but um we went into the black market where kids our age were you know i'm twenty three and we went down there and these kids wanted anything that was made that was American Lee jeans your coats your shoes anything that you brought with you and they'd give you things because they wanted these clothes and they looked just like we did because they would ask for these clothes and stuff so after you came out it was very sad people were in the real drab clothing and whenever you bought something you'd have to go through four or five lines to get it and it was you know really sad to see that but um yeah it it's something else over there everything's breaking down when we the motel we stayed in you know you could only stay in American hotels and uh um the we didn't have water for four days and when we did get it it looked like apple juice it was awful and and you know to see how they live over there right and it was just real sad to see it that way but um you know like our tour guide was a sixteen year old girl um she was married and living with her parents and you know they live in the apartment buildings around there and because she got the job because she could speak English so she got to be a tour guide and it was really bizarre because um she couldn't shave her legs or anything and they couldn't get razors and so um she asked for us to go into the American shop and buy her razors so that she could do that and it was just something else to see yeah you know yeah and and well you know and you know everywhere i went over there it was it was like that but she wanted to do that and and so did every you know all the kids that were our age were you know wanting to be more like that and so it's really scary because_1 there's gonna be some[thing]- something's gonna have to happen y[eah]- yeah i did um Northern State in Aberdeen South Dakota yeah oh okay okay uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh r[ight]- listening to the TV type of thing um-hum they don't understand what's gonna happen that's right and on right now they're bordering on that because there's nothing there you know you've got two leaders one thinks he's doing it and one Gorbachev thinks he's you know got it and you know Yeltsin's got half and and the KGB is supposedly gone but um no you can't you can't they're t[o]- they were too powerful for too long right right um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

okay have you faced uh elderly care yet uh nursing home care for any of your parents uh-huh yes i think sooner or later uh both my mother and my husband's mother we had to end up putting in nursing homes and they were to the point that they only lived both of them about six weeks once they got in and uh-huh and it's absolutely i believe that was one of the hardest things i ever did in my life i that it just you know it's absolutely devastating what have you found in dealing with the nursing homes yes hm um-hum yes yes no uh there was a little bit of difference in in the two between my mother and my mother-in-law and uh theirs both ran oh i think my mother-in-law's was like fifteen hundred and my mother's was two thousand then this has been five years ago and uh uh one of the things that you know i had discovered is that if they knew that i came in there at all different hours they got much better care than if when i started out with my mother-in-law because she was in there first i would go certain hours and they knew and if i'd pop in unexpectedly i discovered you know they did a little bit they did better you know uh-huh and you know a couple of times with my mother-in-law i would catch something not being taken care of and you know would have to rai[se]- so i got to where i knew then when my mother was in that you know not to go the same time all the time and they would and when i was looking for the nursing homes another thing that i learned uh we had my mother all set to go into one and for some reason i just went back and on my own went around the different floors and i saw areas that they had not shown me and they did not come across as well as you know what they had originally shown me so uh we did not put her in that one we put her in another one that i- i went a couple times when they weren't expecting me and saw and you know was much uh better pleased with the situation yes you do uh-huh um-hum uh-huh uh-huh does your mother have Alzheimer's uh-huh um-hum um-hum uh-huh um-hum did she know that she was going to a nursing home did she know that she was going to a nursing home um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
kind of options do you have in your work um-hum that's nice um-hum well we don't get much no we don't um we have to pay for our own insurance and we you know we do get the vacation but we don't get sick pay until we've been there a year and then um i think it starts after four days if you've been gone five consecutive days then you get one day of sick pay and uh um it's real tough for benefits uh-huh right that's the truth uh-huh if you can get some good medical benefits it makes a big difference um-hum right and you don['t]- um-hum yeah i don't have any children but i do have my husband gets um insurance paid through his company but it's still cheaper for me to pay for mine through my job than it is to get onto his um-hum so until he's been there a little longer then maybe i can you know get into that but a little better but um right now no i really don't i really think that benefits um help out a lot you know with the positions um uh benefits you know like you said are are almost better you know that's a lot of pay if you thought if you think about health because_1 i think my husband and i went to um get health insurance from an outside agency once and it would cost just me alone two hundred dollars a month to get basic health insurance and if you think about that on top of your pay it makes a big difference um-hum uh-huh it is unbelievable and then my mom and dad have that Blue Blue Cross Blue Shield and i think that goes up every month that is just something else because they're you know at the retirement age and and that's something too that's just unbelievable oh well that would be great that would be nice yes it would yeah my my husband gets uh life insurance dental insurance and um life and dental and and health and then he also gets legal help legal aid and he also gets like he's entered into a credit union and and and all that that kind of helps out uh-huh well that's nice um-hum my my sister where she works has the HMO which is something that's you know it's nice but you know it's great because you pay five dollars and you go and and your medicine is five dollars but if it's not an emergency you wait three months to get in um-hum and that is um trying to think which one that is but i'm not it's a real popular one but um K[aiser]- Kaiser yes uh-huh um-hum uh-huh um-hum yeah i i'm going with Aetna well i'm just going to stay with the um you know i can go to my doctor i think i pay two hundred and fifty dollar deductible and that's it but yeah because_1 she you know was trying to get into like an eye doctor or something like that and if it's not an emergency you wait for quite a while to get in y[es]- yes it's not yeah my isn't either but through the HMO it is and i think eyes and and about every doctor you could about	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
ah so Beverly what do you think about drug testing yeah we've we got a lot of mistakes here uh in no Maryland Baltimore area because of um train conductors uh on drugs i think we've had two terrible accidents here recently and also on um just like i bet you within five days a truck where the uh a dump truck where the driver was uh high on marijuana i guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and uh drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath the uh a river that leads into the Chesapeake Bay and it would that would up traffic for a long time everybody died the fire was terrible it was awful so i yeah i think you're right i i think i i[f]- if if it's if you're in a field but then you know who would test all truck drivers you know right yeah i think i think a[t]- looking at athletes being drug tested i don't know even i think the random drug testing i don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs because they're still being caught that make sense um yeah and then uh i think yeah i i i think in the long run i think it's it would be good i think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it you know the the test hasn't come down hard on anyone i don't i don't know yeah um-hum right um-hum yeah get rid of him right yeah bu[t]- yeah right i i think that that that's a terrible thi[ng]- you know it's really funny though um i guess my dad was hit by a a drunk driver who was also high um when i was probably eighteen my senior year in high school and um though he's alive today and everything worked out fine it it it happened about two blocks from the high school and a friend came and got me and i was there and i could smell the dope and i could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him and nothing ever happened and from from that point on i became so anti-drunk driving you know now i think people should be allowed to drink i think that's an adult responsibility whatever but i really uh i'm so anti-drunk driving and and drugs have uh long lasting effects and i i guess when i younger i was um probably a little more liberal on the subject yeah an[d]- but as i've a[s]- a[s]- as soon as that happened i guess when i was eighteen years old if you'd have asked me i'd have thought it was fine but i[t]- by the time i was nineteen my opinion had totally changed yeah um-hum right hm traction and all that terrible stuff right right yeah i don't think somebody yeah you don't you don't you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life i can't even say you know i wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life you don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life um-hum yeah um-hum right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
-[o]kay what uh what do you mean by camping uh-huh um-hum uh-huh right uh-huh so like camping to you means tent camping and sleeping bag and to some people camping's going out you know in a motor home oh no ca[mping]- camping to me is you you know like the question said there's different types of camping and going out in a tent and not being around any sort of facilities shower facilities or bathroom facilities and i don't i don't really particularly care for that you know i don't mind staying in tents with sleeping bags and everything but i like you know a bathroom near or shower near um-hum right you know wh[en]- when i was younger i would go up into Colorado and you know and we'd go up and we'd hike up into the mountains and camp with tents you know and we wouldn't have anything and now that i've gotten a little older right like right i don't like to go camping now and stay in a tent without one of the big thick air mattresses to sleep on because ground's a little bit um-hum right um-hum right i've tried those too only part of those is that that they're really not wide enough for your arms to have any place to hang down you know yeah um-hum right no yeah i- i don't either you know some people even bring charcoal with them_1 and um yeah yeah that's that's what i like to use and they just kind of look at me and go well why are you gonna go to that trouble we have this Coleman stove here i just look at them_1 and go uh-huh that's like the people that bring instant coffee with them_1 too and heat up their water and i go what's wrong with the coffee pot yeah that's right well i enjoyed talking with you thank you bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
well let me just start by asking what you think of this Middle East affair we've got going on i have to agree with you there i uh i think that uh for once we should we shouldn't even be at at these Mideast talks because with the exception of our hostages we really don't have to much of a uh a real in[terest]- we shouldn't have too much of a real interest in deciding who's land it is just let these people fight it out you know we've got so many domestic problems and and what does it cost to keep these people over there you know oh so how about_1 the uh the Soviet Union what do you think's gonna happen there the break ups um-hum that's right that's right well let's see Reagan obviously wasn't too concerned with the domestic side of of of uh his political affairs uh and i think Bush's kind of followed suit um international is important but i mean we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed uh you know and then there's the homeless issue and and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without uh hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations i think and we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending right i agree we've been writing off way too many bad debts uh country bad debts exactly i know it right that's right you're either liberal or you're conservative well i think uh i[t]- it wouldn't hurt and i know the Independent Party's been trying for years to get a a a real force in in the uh in Congress but uh you're right there's just too many issues that come up that uh our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a Democratic issue or it's a Republican issue and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel i think uh we might have a a lot better a lot more efficient running government and and a lot better laws passed he's one of the two huh well let's see uh Senators are in for six years right and uh when did you guys vote him into office oh you're stuck	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

these pretty new ones that are out and you think oh well maybe maybe i would like a new car but i think i'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway but uh right they are i sure do like the looks of that new Mit[subishi]- Mitsubishi Diamante that is a pretty car uh-huh that's pretty too yeah they get pretty expensive the last one i bought i bought a uh well it's a it's a Town Car but it was a demo returned and i got it with like you know i think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it and nearly ten thousand dollars o[ff]- less than what the list price was so i was really pleased to find that and i then i bought it for cheaper i was looking at a Honda Accord a brand new one and i bought this uh the the Lincoln Town Car for just a little less money than what i was gonna buy the new Honda Accord and the thing about it is they give you that ten uh tha[t]- that hundred thousand mi[le]- mile five year warranty where it only costs you twenty five dollars to have anything repaired so uh i have really been impressed i said i'll probably never be able to find another one that i can afford you know but i have loved this car better than anything i've ever driven because you you can go on the road and get there and you're not even tired and it gets like twenty six miles to the gallon on the road it sure does i ha[d]- they kept telling me that and i thought they're crazy so the week after i got it well actually before i signed the papers on it i took it over to Boozier City and it did it but it uh yeah well that's kind of what we've always been told you know they'll do it and then we hope for it and it never happens but it really it does get good gas mileage most of the time when i don't go anywhere i can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work you know and then fill it up so i haven't had i've taken it in twice for like just really minor things and it cost me the twenty five dollars the uh rea[lly]- really something really silly when we first got it we couldn't get the light they have all these lights in the car and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the backseat and we couldn't get the light to turn off and we ke[pt]- kept trying you know and we went out to dinner with some friends and it stayed on all night you know just shining right down on them you know and we couldn't get it to turn off and the next day my husband goes out there and he tries to get it off we turn the knob you know in the front that's supposed to turn the lights on and off and we turned everything we could and he took it in and they said you know you just have to press the switch he says i've pressed every switch in that car and i can't get the light off it's broken so they took it in and charged us the twenty five dollars and they called and told us though that all you have to do is turn the off switch and they showed us where the switch was they they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them_1 he had already done the switch but he hadn't he hadn't done the right one and it's right on the arm rest in the back and we didn't know it was there and the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car you know there it was broken but we've had just uh i guess it's been in two times i've had it three years now and uh it's been in two maybe three times but it's just been real minor things that's right um-hum that's right but it's really it's been an enjoyable car like i say i'll probably never be able to have another one because i think we bought it for about sixteen thousand you know and i said i'll never find another one for that price and they keep going up so i'll have to enjoy it	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay what type of things do you feel would invade your privacy everyday yeah that's right that is really an invasion of privacy i f[ind]- i find it very annoying when i've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly with solicitors and the carpet cleaning companies and does that happen in your part of the country i uh i come home and i'm trying to get a few things done and i can't do anything but answer the telephone some evenings are worse than others but i wish i could put a stop to it but i don't know what to do to stop it um-hum they'll think it didn't mean them i guess everybody but me oh goodness are you sti[ll]- do you live at home with your parents um-hum so your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family now what can you do to stop that no just have to live with it i guess try to remember to respect their privacy and maybe they'll respect yours and do you have brothers oh okay i was rai[sed]- i had two younger brothers and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations and i would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they couldn't hear me and then they'd go get on the other extension and i could hear them but i couldn't get them_1 to hang up you know even it in the office i uh find that people walk up and and when you're on a conversation instead of walking off or just making themselves busy they'll stand there and listen to what you say until uh-huh um yeah let's see i can't think of anything else i'd really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors about the only thing that really bothers me i don't have that many people coming to my door uh-huh and i guess that's really the the thing that really bugs me the most i can't think that her kids in our neighborhood used to bother me but they have all gotten grown up now and we live in a neighborhood where there's not any little kids to bother me since mine are all grown up but what else would be an annoyance well i guess traffic could be an annoyance do you have a lot of traffic in your area um-hum some days it's real real bad here and you would like to because you can't even ride down the road without people all the way around you you know but it really is and pretty noisy it really is i live right on a main thoroughfare so when i first moved here i probably did consider that an invasion of privacy because it at first you'd hear a lot of noise especially at night you know when you go to bed and every time a a fire truck or anything went down the road i'd wake up but i guess i've gotten used to it because i don't even hear it anymore and uh i just close it out i guess because i do[n't]- i don't remember waking up in several years at night when i'd hear a fire truck go by you know i think they'd probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me they'd have to chop down the door and get you out i guess let's see what else is an invasion ooh well did you have has name all over them that was yours yeah yeah yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well have you seen a new movie lately um-hum okay i uh i haven't seen either one of those uh what what are some of the shows you've been able to rent though well maybe you uh you've seen Dance With Wolves okay what'd you think of that one um-hum yeah i uh i just moved down in fact from South Dakota in in June and that's where the movie was filmed and uh we when when the movie came out we went uh my dad lives in the state capital which is Pierre and it was filmed right outside of Pierre in fact the buffalo the scene the big buffalo herd scene that was that was a live scene uh there's a guy that's got a a buffalo farm he's got over ten thousand head of buffalo and and uh we my dad's got a little plane we flew over it all an[d]- looked at the buffalo it was really neat but uh so we're watching the m[ovie]- the movie in the movie theater in Pierre and uh just every time i'd start to get into the movie it wa[s]- it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell hey there's John Red Eagle you know or you know they'd they'd start recognizing people yeah that kind of uh i think i enjoyed it more when i when i watched it on video cassette than i did uh in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they'd say that i'd go now now which one could that be you know and i'd i'd start trying to focus in on people instead of of picking up the overall r[ight]- right exactly so but i- i thought it was a good film but you're right i think uh i think it was very one sided sure right i[n]- in fact i was watching Wild Wild West last night and it was a similar uh situation with the Iroquois Indians attacking uh an army fort um but it was an interesting movie uh have you seen Pretty Woman i thought that was a good show yeah it didn't uh it didn't have any real social bearing or uh and it wasn't really a comedy but it was an enjoyable movie it wa[s]- it wa[s]- kind of like the Star Wars se[ries]- series you know just something a little different yet believable uh hey are you are you going to see or do you are you much of a Star Trek's fan are you gonna see this next one that's coming out have you seen the rest i think i've missed one i'm not sure but i think i've missed one was that here in Dallas okay because_1 we had one here in Dallas uh-huh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so what do you uh think is the uh the worst culprit for air pollution um-hum yeah well i[t's]- i uh it's hard to put the finger on uh what's worse you know the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion um with uh your hydrocarbons uh causing the damage in which well well i notice on one of these uh home shopping networks they were selling these uh halogen uh fire extinguishers and the halogen is uh an ozone {depleter} and it got hydrocarbons in there it's a very clean uh fire extinguisher but it's you know really bad on the environment yeah oh yeah yeah i know uh in the Twin Cities area i just moved out of there and was kind of happy i timed it just right but they had a new policy where in order to get your uh your license uh your car license uh renewed you had to meet the pollution standards and uh yeah yeah and yeah i guess that was just mainly in the cities there and i as far as where i live i don't have to do that but i have an old car which i doubt would uh would uh pass the inspection a seventy six and uh you know there's no way i would put in a lot of money to to repair it to meet standards yeah so although i do what i can to to cut down pollution but uh yeah yeah um-hum yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well well around here our we get the well depends you know either in the in the winter time it it blows it your way and we probably get yours yeah yeah well i[t]- i[t]- th[at's]- that's a a big thing too i i know it's has nothing do with air pollution but i kind of look at the way people treat our	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
what kind of car would you like to buy next huh why would that be a okay well that's good if you had uh no financial requirements if you could buy any car in the entire world no matter what it cost what would you buy say what which type of Cadillac uh is your favorite the Seville that's a sharp looking car that really is it it always has been though you know it doesn't have the Coup de Ville or the Sedan de Ville squareness it never really has it's always had it's own unique look yeah i've always liked that i liked the the one year they had or the couple o[f]- years they had were uh the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it i thought now that looks sharp that looks real sharp um-hum yeah and uh the i i've never really uh i've never ridden in one recently um but they're supposed to be just real smooth just a nice comfortable ride uh-huh right now they've got a uh a unique fea[ture]- uh feature in them_1 now if uh if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed the e[ngine]- the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesn't come through the so it does not go it doesn't go through the you know into the inside it'll go underneath the car instead so that's that's a big safety factor they've got in them_1 now the air bags yep so though that's great that's great so you say you've you've always uh preferred General Motors products what uh right what kind of uh General Motors cars have you had in the past Oldsmobiles those are real nice riding cars too has that been the Cutlass or the Sierra the Ninety Eight okay well i don't think uh let's see the Ninety Eight now that's got that big V eight engine in it doesn't it doesn't it has a little V six okay it oh that's great that's great that's always nice to get uh reliability in a product especially when you're spending you know anywhere from fifteen to twenty five thousand dollars for for a single item you know you just don't want any hassles with it you just you expect it to do its its job and i think a lot of a lot of car manufacturers don't really keep that into consider[ation]- don't take that into consideration you know they just expect you to buy their product but that's always been something that's been a key factor in me is how reliable is this car gonna be you know price is is an issue but it's not the most important issue right uh well i've always been a Ford man myself yes but that's all right you know it's it's American made too which is good um but i i've ever since i guess i wa[s]- i was growing up my dad's always had Fords and uh well i grew up in South Dakota so everybody has a truck and uh my Ford trucks have just i've i've just never had problems with them_1 i honestly think i would die before my truck would kill over on me so	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
okay good morning now do you have any pets three dogs my goodness what kind of dogs do you have my goodness gracious that uh gives you a lot of work doesn't it uh-huh well i my dog uh was just sort of a mixture of two and i can't tell you the kinds died about uh six or eight months ago and uh her name was Gena and she was a very very sweet dog we loved her very very much but the pet that is of great interest that maybe uh you would enjoy hearing about about um twenty five twenty six years ago my brother-in-law showed up in my front yard pulling a trailer and in this trailer he had a pony which i didn't know he was bringing and so over the weekend i had to go out and find some wood and and put up some kind of a structure to house that pony because_1 he a stall because_1 he brought the pony to my children and that pony lived with us for about twenty five years and uh the his name is Sandy and he was a champion jumper in Chicago it turned out that my brother-in-law's daughter had had a ponies in a at a certain place out there and it caught on fire and they they got out there and got all the ponies out and these people were so happy that they gave her this pony for saving the rest of them_1 and as i say we had Sandy for about twenty six years he has his own little house back there and um two acres of ground to no he about a year ago he was thirty one years old which is very old for a pony they know he was a medium to large size pony and uh i used to know the different uh breakdown yeah and uh he he was really a nice guy i really can't complain about Sandy you have two horses well tell me what what what things do you do with those those horses to enjoy them oh okay you you ride them_1 uh-huh um-hum my goodness you are a busy lady with two ponies and three dogs i'm afraid the cat would be scared to death i'd i have i have a cat a pony a cat pony i have a cat also whose name is Babe and it used to be in the old days i had uh mothers and father cats you know and then we'd have a of six or eight and litters around and so forth and this is the only one that's left from the whole big batch that uh lived through the years when my children were at home now the pony has died the dog has died and the three children have moved out and have their own homes and so my wife and i and Babe are the ones left on the farm now we are so busy right now trying to take care of ourselves that uh i don't know how we can handle any other pets right now if things ever calm down why we'd like to have pets again i- i enjoyed uh Gena she was a very sweet dog but i hate to have her she was an outside dog and i hated to have her on a chain all of her life but that's basically what she had to do we could let her loose and let her run oh for an hour or two every day but we had to make certain she didn't get off the property or get up to the highway and um-hum uh-huh well mine mine have always slept outdoors and well they had their own house um-hum yep they certainly depend on you but uh my dog Gena as i say she had her own house and she was warm and comfortable in there and other times why she could go in the in the barn with the pony and uh they got so they had their own great big house back there i have several other acres of ground that i normally planted corn so i have a big enough building back there i had to build this new building to put the pony in the little one i built only lasted about two he had to move into his new castle yes he had the works so i'm sure that uh Sandy had a a good life he was fed twice a day and had his own two acres to roam in and to graze and so forth	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well what kind of car uh are you thinking of buying next you like the Chrysler products do you do you really what year is it an[d]- why don't you like the Mustang i'll be darned well you know the old sayings about Fords what they stand for there you go well uh well we've always uh we've always had Oldsmobiles and uh been very uh happy with Oldsmobiles but uh my wife thought she wanted to get a Ford Mustang and then she kind of changed her mind and thinks her next car ought to be one of those uh Mitsubishi Eclipses she real[ly]- she likes uh likes those uh she has a sister that lives in uh Phoenix that has one and uh really uh enjoys it well what uh what things do you consider when you buy a car i see yeah well especially when you're in high traffic areas and have to mess with that all the time that makes it very frustrating now this is a LeBaron i sure like the uh convertible those ragtop LeBarons they really look sporty well uh we always this last Oldsmobile we bought uh it's an eighty seven but we bought it in eighty eight you know right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them and uh we found that uh we found a real good interest rate you know when they're trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like that they really come down on their prices and uh um you know we looked around at used cars and we really couldn't uh afford the payments on a used car because uh if you go to the bank and try to get a loan they want to charge twelve thirteen percent you know and we ended up i think with like a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car and our payments well that's great uh-huh well when our kids were younger we really wanted a two door our first car was an Oldsmobile back in seventy seven it was a two door Cutlass Supreme and um it just happened that when we looked for our our new car they had a thing going with Oldsmobile and if you'd buy a a new Oldsmobile they'd give you four hundred dollar rebate because it was their seventy fifth anniversary i belie[ve]- it yeah seventy fifth anniversary so in addition to everything else we got off the car all we had to do is show them_1 our uh papers on our first car and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it so we we got a four door this time and i sort of went more for the uh the comfort factor and uh i like the smaller cars but i'm a bigger person and i i really like comfort you know driving along the road and stuff yep and if you try to take anybody uh you know go to the show or go out for supper and you go as a foursome	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

um i guess when i think of camping i think of going out and setting up a tent and and uh cooking out and that kind of thing what do you think of it as yeah well i know we used to do that when our children were younger and uh we could uh we even had it fixed up where we could setup a tent and have a have supper ready in about thirty minutes so it worked out real well for us then have you ever done that oh oh oh yeah and oh okay you can't you're gonna camp out at Caesar's Palace huh all right different perspective yeah um-hum right now where did what kind of country did you go camping in oh yeah now that's so peaceful um-hum yeah yeah well i think it depends on probably as a child you didn't feel that you left your friends at home and you didn't like there's much to do um yeah what kind of places did your parents go to when they camped in the trailers just uh various parks and things hm um-hum um-hum oh my no hm well let's see Wildwood in New Jersey did you go there aha i thought you might i understand that's a very popular place if you live in that area yeah lots of uh my husband was raised in Pennsylvania and uh some of his friends had always talked about and what got me they never went anywhere on vacation but to Wildwood i- i'm you know i'm they'd go to the go to the shore go to the shore and we said you know really there are other places in the world but hum-um but they we have these friends he went to high school with that they go to the same place every year and have for the last twenty years well i you know i guess it's fine if they like it but i like to move around a little um-hum that's true and they each have their own special beauty have you ever been um up to uh Lake Texoma here in T[exas]- uh Texas that's pretty they have a a park up there uh Eisenhower Park have you been there now that's where one place our children used to like to go now they like to go out and fish and things like that and course they go and do their own thing since they're grown but they uh they still talk about our camping trips so maybe they didn't dislike them_1 so much but uh are you planning to go on any more camping trips well if you get invited huh that sounds good yeah you stay pretty busy here then what's about your ideal time when you go camping how long do you h[ave]- like to go no how many how many how many a week a two weeks a few days or um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

did they mention our topic okay right anything anything in the area of types of vacations you've been on lately you've really enjoyed uh-huh well i'm a lot the same way we uh i was raised well West Virginia but also Virginia and i spent an awful a lot of time on the Virginia Beach area and i sort of love the water i've always loved the ocean so i enjoy going to the beaches myself as far as a favorite beach um probably Myrtle Beach is as as more of a younger person i haven't been there for years i'd like to go back and see how it has changed but i enjoy Myrtle Beach i enjoy Padre Island right here in Texas but i enjoy pretty much any beaches well i haven't been right haven't been for twenty years myself but one of these days i'll go back and see how nice it is i'm sure it's just as nice as ever as a as a high schooler and a college kid it was a great place to go it was the big weekend place and things like that especially in the summer the place to go in the summer to get a you know a summer job and to spend your dollars and uh have fun and everything no i haven't oh i'll bet it is what do you do what do you do while you're there uh-huh right yeah my wife would probably enjoy -[en]joy we'd probably enjoy that also are you Catholic okay we're we're Catholics so we'd we'd def[initely]- definitely enjoy all the old churches right uh-huh oh no kidding we'll have to maybe give that a try sometime if you're a a water person my wife still says the best vacation we ever went on with our kids and as a family was we went to one of the Jack Tarr Villages in the Caribbean and we went to one the one located at Puerto Plata and you know that's the most reasonable vacation we were ever on we just opened the paper one morning four or five years ago and it said round trip all included seven days hotel food all you could drink just every party everything it was almost like a cruise but uh it was like five ninety nine so we said let's do it so we packed up everyone four of us plus my son's girlfriend we all went and it's probably not like i said not only the most reasonable vacation we were ever on and everything was paid for it was just glorious i mean the water was fantastic you g[et]- they had pools they had beaches people were so courteous the lodging was fantastic the food was just like being on a cruise ship everything from Baked Alaska right on down and all this for five hundred and ninety nine dollars it was oh it is unbelievable and we keep saying that one of these days our kids are getting older now they're in college and uh be getting married and whatever so we doubt we'll ever have the opportunity to go back with our with our kids but but we're certainly going back but that's probably one place that we really enjoyed that included everything airfare every meal i mean if you were a heavy drinker you could sit there and drink twenty five or thirty drinks a day or whatever you wanted i mean just it was everything and it was just a a Caribbean type of surrounding very tropical just uh entertainment every night i don't know if you've ever been a cruise ship or not but it was exactly like being on a cruise ship and we were on four cruises and uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well um i don't know i'm have only been um selected for jury duty one time and it was sort of a a rude awakening to our judicial system um after having served on the jury and uh come to a decision uh an[d]- and really it was a case that was cut and dry the uh the defendant on uh the witness stand admitted he was guilty and then uh the first thing that was done was after um w[e]- we found him guilty his attorney jumped up and uh started going through the pro[cedure]- you know routine for filing an appeal you know i i i know that that's the right uh but the defendant but i mean it makes you wonder why go through it one more time when you know he admitted he was guilty of the crime so um i don't know that it was a little bit disgruntling to me right uh-huh oh not i agree with that and certainly um i think that uh i know that uh i have heard of people being you know in on a on a criminal case and uh saying that you know and i think you've got this option that if you want if you are found guilty by the jury that you can choose even before the trial begins for the judge to sentence you uh and that i i think i think i'm correcting correct in that but uh uh-huh right right right well i i understand what you're saying and at the same time i'm afraid that there are people out there that wal[k]- are walking around that have no more conception of what's going on day in and day out than if someone came down from Mars and and unfortunately those people who m[y]- in my book i would i would consider them to be terribly uninformed might be deemed the most eligible people be put on the jury while l[ike]- like you said earlier i don't necessarily would i don't i'd consider them to be a jury of my peers you know so i but that's well you know one of the reasons why i hope i never have to be in a have a jury listen to what a case of mine and i hope i never you know am in that situation right right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
-[o]kay Jerry i guess tonight's topic is about recycling and i'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our community here in Plano right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the by the collection agency or the the city along with your garbage can uh you can put out newspaper you can put out glass you can put out aluminum cans you can put put out certain types of plastic material and that's on a roll out effort right now not all the citizens and the people in Plano can go ahead and uh participate right now but uh that will be rolled out to everyone i hope in the next year or so and those that aren't participating they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum and i think uh overall that's an an excellent opportunity because_1 i hate to see our landfills being filled up and uh growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they're becoming a big problem for o[nly]- not only the people that are living today but for the future also so how about_1 your community Dye Mound uh-huh sounds like a place where i grew up well i like it uh-huh well good oh okay um-hum oh well let's hope not you can be uh get in trouble for that uh-huh well it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack isn't it okay okay yes until you release it all right i think that's yes yes i sure do uh-huh um-hum oh yes no well great that's excellent well uh if a lot of people did that th[en]- then we wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail that's a great idea i hadn't thought about that and we might be able to incorporate some of that one thing right um-hum right oh yes well that's a great idea that's a great idea product yes uh-huh yes they will exactly hm well that's a full time job yes well i've found out too that uh you know a couple years ago we've always been recycling newspaper for the last twelve years and at one time we could get a pretty good return uh with the Boy Scouts we could take and collect the newspaper an and	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well seems to me the one of the reasons that people don't go out to vote is maybe they're bored with the whole election process well sometimes strangely enough one vote has made the difference well it's kind of strange because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their day-to-day lives well main part of the problem is they don't they think they have enough choices you know in some of the European countries they have numbers of parties that run and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country well maybe it's a matter of you know voter awareness well i think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long in Britain you know they have a set period of time and and for campaign that's it in this country it seems like it's a continuous ongoing campaign well the they don't want to spend the time or they don't have the money well it's a matter of name recognition people aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of and even debates don't seem to help much so we're really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers well that was certainly a media event well he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay do y[ou]- do you have a home or are you in apartment okay so do you have to do a lot of garden work uh-huh uh-huh um-hum um-hum yeah uh-huh well that's nice i wish i could ours is pretty small too but it it takes about_1 an hour with the two of us working to you know do the bushes and and all of that sort of thing um the worst part is controlling the weeds which i hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals and because_1 like we have a dog and and you know he's gonna be out in the yard and who knows what he eats out there but we try not to use them_1 but we end up using some anyway uh hum what else i get to put out all the Christmas lights out there and all that sort of well if if they go up like one year we did the edge of the house all the way up on the roof and i i went up on the roof once and i'll never do it i decided i was afraid so this year he got lazy so i said fine i'll put some on the bushes and that's about it that's all i[t]- it gets but um-hum um-hum um-hum oh wow oh no uh-huh yeah oh um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum hum but you still have to pay for it though even though they're not gonna do it oh is it real expensive oh okay oh my goodness yeah well do do they do other things for y'all um-hum um-hum um-hum uh-huh um-hum hm but you knew when you moved in you'd have to pay that didn't you oh yeah i don't know either that's interesting um-hum now do they do things like plant bushes and trees oh okay so there's like no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that um-hum yeah when we moved into our house i just hated the bushes they had and i- i ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back and put new ones out front but that was a lot of work took me a long time um-hum yeah and then then we put in a sprinkler system and we won't go through that again i will pay someone to oh it took so long because my husband was you know digging the trenches because_1 he didn't want to get a trencher you know there the machine that'll do it because he knew so many people that broke it through their water main or their gas main doing it and i guess that costs you an absolute fortune by hand yeah but it works great now that we've got it yeah it's nice yeah well we needed to because_1 we're having some foundation trouble and you know you have to keep the the area moist around the house or it makes it worse so we had an incentive there to do that	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
-[to]night i understand we're supposed to talk about space flight hope you know more about it than i do oh is that right i haven't read his book i was so upset with Texas that i haven't gotten into anymore of his books because_1 i thought it was horrible well and i don't think he was truthful in a lot of what he did in Texas so i wasn't sure how credible he was but anyway what do you think we've gained from the space flights ego trip uh-huh oh is that right uh-huh where do you live are you living in U[tah]- am i talking to Utah right now oh oh great because_1 i'm in Dallas i see i see Carolyn Rash is her name Rash Carolyn Rash i see i see well you probably know a lot about it i wasn't sure that they were blaming that space disaster on one company i hadn't heard that uh-huh uh-huh oh yeah oh yeah i would think so too you never think about that do you i would think it'd be harder to get up than it would be get back down uh-huh right well i saw one of some of those early space capsules at Smithsonian and i'm sure you've seen more of them_1 than i have but you could see the scorch on them_1 you know they had those tiles but you could see where they would come off in them_1 how hot it got because_1 it was still the scorch on them_1 which was quite interesting well i th[ought]- excuse me go ahead oh you haven't uh-huh yeah well these were the ones that John Glenn went up in you know the old old ones the very first ones the little bell type things yeah they really were they just uh oh yeah and uh the whole thing is small and yeah you you i mean you actually put it on you put it around you l[ike]- pretty much it was so small well i thought there were some medical benefits that we have learned from space but did he go into that in the book an[d]- i guess that's just to sell us on it oh yeah um-hum well that's true and well do you think we should continue to support it at the level well i thought probably one of the things that were we doing that they didn't tell us was spying because i think those satellites you know you or not satellites but the space flights could really spy and with uh with uh Russia's demise i didn't know if we should continue to support it at the current level yeah um-hum no i do[n't]- i don't either yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay you know what happens is i've tried i was out because of surgery last week so i tried calling a couple of eight o'clock calls and i got a person from Utah and a person from New York and a person from New Jersey so i thought sort of need her calling really early in the morning out of town so that's why that's why i've been ma[king]- been making it a habit of calling in the morning but anyway uh the topic was the most important benefit of your job today besides salary and how satisfied are you and everything i'm sort of self-employed so uh i really i'd be at a a little loss for words on this as far as i'm concerned most definitely uh most important benefit today would be hospitalization and of course retirement and things like that uh-huh well that's very true i can understand that because i'm a just a small business person i run a my company has five people but uh they're all straight commission salesmen so they all provide their own insurance and it's been that way since nineteen seventy four and my office is just a one person office i have myself plus my secretary and she comes in at nine leaves at five and uh she's on her husband's insurance program and i just uh yes yes oh that's great oh that's neat are you married okay well i'm married and my wife's a school teacher so i'm on h[er]- they have pretty good insurance so i they she carries me on her insurance program which works out real well she's in the Plano School District in Plano and it's not cheap it's like all insurance insurance just keeps on going up more and more every day and course the uh the prices they're charging today and because of the problems they have oh deductibles are high oh you bet supplemental anything is important today i'll tell you whether well that's great well that's super we're just uh i carry my own Keogh Plan as far as benefits and i've been doing that since nineteen seventy four or seventy five or whatever and that's more or less my wife's and my retirement i'm fifty years old my wife is forty nine and she didn't start teaching till she was forty so we raised our kids first and she went back and got her degree and started teaching so it looks like we're gonna retire in a couple of years and she'll uh she'll qualify for a little something after ten years of teaching but not a whole lot but it'll be certainly be useful and needed i'm in the sporting goods business i'm a own a manufacturer's rep firm and uh we represent eighteen different hunting and shooting type companies and that's all i've done since i graduated school years ago so[ld]- a sold really oh it's neat isn't it oh yes	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well wha[t]- what what do you feel do you feel that that our government uh is it possible to have an honest government or do we have an honest government um-hum well uh i['m]- i'm i'm rather young i'm only twenty two and so uh my knowledge is based you know mostly on what i read you know in history but i do think based on what i read uh what i've read thr[ough]- uh a[bout]- about our history of our government i think things are getting better uh in the in the last maybe ten or fifteen years where Americans are becoming a little more aware and uh are forcing our government to be uh on top of you know as an order uh-huh yeah yeah um-hum right yeah uh-huh have i no not yet huh-uh uh-huh right does it worry you that um say someone like David Duke got su[ch]- such publicity during uh during his campaign and that and that now he's running for uh thinking of running for president does that worry you at all uh-huh um-hum yeah yeah uh i- i don't either i hope he doesn't know something we or i ho[pe]- yeah hope he doesn't know something we don't um-hum wow oh yeah uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah well uh i'm kind of disappointed that that uh the two parties have such a stronghold in the in the nation because i[f]- if if you belong to any other party uh you know any other platform i should say uh y[ou]- you're not represented um i i don't i don't belong to any particular uh platform and and i don't think i ever will but i'm afraid that um i think his name was Anderson was the the gentleman who ran for uh on an independent ticket against Reagan and uh Carter um i was real disappointed that uh uh that he didn't he didn't have a chance uh because he didn't have a platform behind him uh uh you know a group and i think that's a little bit disconcerting you know where wh[ere]- uh where we r[eally]- really Americans don't have a voice unless they participate within o[ne]- one of the two systems um-hum um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay um tell me about where you live uh-huh yeah no i live in Houston although i did live in Dallas for uh six years up until uh nineteen ninety and then i- i moved to Houston but uh i uh had lived in Houston before and uh from nineteen eighty to nineteen eighty four and uh l[ived]- worked downtown and when i was transferred from Atlanta uh to Houston i- i bought a condo in southwest Houston no and i clocked it and it was only nine miles from the office and of course didn't think that would be bad uh but the only time i ever drove it was not during rush hour so a[fter]- it was a rude awakening to me to find out what i faced every morning and every afternoon in because where i lived in Atlanta wa[s]- i lived right on Peachtree um a mile and a half from the office and so i wasn't accustomed to commuting and it nearly killed me so whenever i moved back to Houston i said i- i declared that i would not live where i had to drive on the freeways so now i live in really inner city and uh but it's only it takes me about ten minutes to get to the office and i love it well i'm in an apartment but uh it's just i don't know it's uh i mean most most of the people that i work with you know commute in anywhere from thirty to forty five minutes some of them_1 an hour or more one way and you know i mean i've i've had a house before and i mean and it's nice but it's just not worth it to me to sit behind the wheel of a car for that long i just i can't do it so anyway i'm ve[ry]- i'm i'm pretty content for the time being where i am uh-huh uh-huh that i[sn't]- that isn't bad really yeah right uh you know it's like i said i- i mean i've even had people at the office ask me they say how do you justify paying the kind of money you pay for rent because i do pay a lot of money every month for rent i don't deny it but at the same time i said well you know let's think about it i said i drive um less than ten miles a day round-trip and they go you know they're jaws dropped and then and then they go and i spend way less than thirty minutes a day round-trip commuting and you know that doesn't that's regardless of the weather if it's raining it still doesn't take me any longer i mean sometimes whenever and you know how Houston is it's just so flat and we have these torrential downpours sometimes and people literally get you know traffic gets backed up with the wrecks and everything and it'll take them_1 an hour and a half to get to work and they're just frayed by the they get there i think no way so that's right oh i agree with you a hundred percent since i'm um mo[ved]- got this place i mean i used to i can remember years ago when i work[ed]- especially whenever i lived in Houston before i used to put twenty thousand miles a year on my car last year i put less than twelve on my car you know and you you can really tell a difference i mean i just don't you know it's just not i don't have that expense and by the time i cut down the the cost of my insurance because my car insurance is a little bit less by living so close then the additional automobile expense i don't know it's i- i thought about it it's i mean i would like to own again i've owned in the past but i don't know i'm i'm hesitant to give up the convenience plus where i live is so well managed i mean if i have any little thing go wrong i just pick up the phone at the office i call my manager i said we got this problem i come home in the afternoon there's a note on my dining room table saying we've been in we fixed it let us know if there's a problem you know i love it hey

well seems to me that part of the problem with public education may just be the wide disparity in what's being offered i don't know what you've experienced i've heard of it well part of the deal is uh in addition to the public schools there're all these other alternatives such as the private schools and the religious schools and the home schooling and and some of these other options that uh that people are looking at but uh to ensure that everyone has a chance the public education system has got to do the job well there're a number of them what happens is we have a number of school districts and those school districts that are considered quality people stay in those school districts that are not quality people who can afford them opt out and and are going to the private schools or the schools that are sponsored by by the one of the religions well there's always people end up going to schools who can't afford to go anywhere else who will end up still going to that particular school and and can't opt out because they don't have the money to go to private schools private schools here are very expensive i i don't know much about the religious schools about the only really religious schools around here are the ones operated by the Catholic Church but it seems that the private schools uh get the greater share of people than the religious schools do well well you know salaries for teachers i think are low everywhere um most teachers never end up making much money if you're if you're good in an area and are not dedicated you can make far more money being in that area rather than teaching in that area no do you oh well they've been talking about that a few school districts are going to start experimenting with that but it hasn't really gotten going yet um as far as i know they're doing something else but i don't know specifically you know what they are doing of course if if it interrupted it here then it would mess up lots of sports and camps and other things that rely on that you know long vacation period	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay_1 well i don't see many of the current movies i usually wait till they come in the second run theaters but um what what ones have you seen lately um-hum yep oh you did um-hum did you like it i'm not but my husband is and he went last weekend to see it yeah he did huh okay i saw that recently yeah in fact i saw it twice well actually once it was on an airplane and then the second time it was at a um it's interesting it's an old uh theater not a movie theater but like a play theater that and they've put in tables and chairs then they show movies in there so it's kind of neat yeah um-hum um-hum yes yes um yeah it's it's one of these lighthearted things it's it's not very serious but it's it it was cute i really i enjoyed it so no huh-uh oh no i haven't seen that i saw Hundred and One Dalmatians no i went with my next door neighbor our husbands both said no way it used to be my favorite movie when i was little so i went back and i don't think so i don't know but you know we went for a dollar it was fun i really enjoyed it i didn't get bored or anything either yeah we have a real nice one it's brand new and um i- i suspect it'll be a full priced theater when this highway goes in but right now it's almost in the middle of nowhere so it's not very crowded and it's real inexpensive and it's brand new so it's it's a really nice place to go yeah um-hum um-hum no huh-uh i don't know i think my husband'll want to see it so i'll do the same thing i'll wait till it's because_1 he said when he went to see Star Trek he was out in California with a friend he said it was like seven fifty a person i think it's about_1 six dollars yeah wow yeah well i think you can get that maybe on a matinee here but you know about six dollars is what they're running and that's why i don't normally go to them yeah yeah yeah that's right yeah yeah we usually go usually every weekend we go to one yeah yeah well we never used to do that until this other theater went in and it's you know it's inexpensive and it's entertainment for night and um the only thing is that when people at work talk about the current movies i don't know what's going on but you know about_1 four weeks later i will yeah they have been lately it used to be you'd have to wait months and months and now like i was just looking at the listings now this week they started showing All I Want for Christmas and that's a very recent release yeah well i don't know yes yeah it used to be like that but now	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um what do you feel about child care mine are too but i think it's a real rea[l]- a real serious situation for a lot of people and i don't you know a lot about it wh[ere]- where you're working for this school department leave the school uh-huh um-hum well you're probably in a more uh oh wha[t]- w[e]- we live in a ru[ral]- rural area and so i think most of the people around here that have to leave their children leave them with uh neighbors or people you know in a home situation so uh-huh um-hum um-hum yeah did you have you worked all the time your children were little oh uh-huh so but that's about the time then they could go into a preschool situation oh uh-huh oh oh yes uh you know i don't know how people we it's pretty cold here in Utah in the winter and i th[ink]- i just think it would be so hard to have to get a child up a baby and take it in the cold to someone early in the morning i think that that i would let i think i would sooner have it in someone in the home taking care of it in a home oh yes uh-huh to come into your home but i um-hum yes unless you can get could get a a nanny or something that i know a lot of the girls here go off as nannies and stay in people's homes and take care of them_1 after they've graduated from high school not a lot but some of them but uh i think that'd be an ideal situation i've never had to to uh work out of the home i've had we had uh six children and they just i would just i was just here with them_1 right and right well there was seventeen years between them_1 but that uh yeah we[ll]- i just i just really that's what i wanted to do you know and but i know that my children's spouses and i have five boys and a girl and uh in the middle uh-huh we kept trying but uh the our our daughter or none of them have worked very much while their children have been little so but uh we have fourteen grandchildren so this i[s]- i i feel lucky that they have not had to go out of the home because i i i don't know i just think that those first two or three years and then again in high school they they need their mother there so uh it's in the <b_aside> how cold is it honey right now <e_aside> about twenty eight is it still raining oh good are you um-hum what do you do in the school district do you oh well that's be interesting i love books so uh-huh well i think if you're trained and i think if you feel it within yourself that you want to be out you know and you you ha[ve]- uh you have the ability and stuff that's great there were times when loved to have got you know uh-huh to le[ft]- to have left my kids and you know i'm sure they do i'm sure that's so too and i think it makes them_1 more independent um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh do you have very many family reunions that one you have over to Bear Lake is the grandfather of all of them isn't it oh oh uh-huh mountains uh-huh oh they don't have that anymore oh uh-huh do you have any other reunions oh um-hum hum they didn't auction it or anything oh oh uh-huh oh with the one up to the up to Bear Lake do you uh do anything like genealogy or or anything like that oh uh my family goes up to uh Cub River up to Willow Flat for three days every year i mean it's there's not as much to do up as there is up at Bear Lake but we just go and camp out and wade in the river and no that's the fourth of July one that we go down to the cabin uh-huh uh-huh yeah but but that's but the one that we go up to Bear Lake with my family is the m[ore]- more people come it's my father's and mother's children that go to that one so but and then we have a great big Johnson one a[bout]- every other year that we m[ake]- that we make a quilt and sell it and then w[e'll]- we'll sell chances on it and then that pays for all of the mailing and everything that's concerned with it yeah it does it works out really good oh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh just wait till it falls in your lap huh neith[er]- am i but it's really important i think to keep those connections yeah uh-huh uh-huh well i i don't know we've the Waites had a reunion too but that that fe[ll]- every other every other year but that fell through because people just wouldn't take charge and do it so and maybe there's a time to let go too i don't know i uh-huh but then people get involved in other things and involved in others you know but i think it's really important to keep the your generation and the earlier generation together so uh-huh we had a we had the the the one the small one and then for his too we have a great big Christmas party every year a[nd]- and then the the summer one fourth of around the fourth of July but the the i don't know they those are are just his immediate family they're not ex[tended]- it's not extended is that say we have to quit	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
he likes them well i do vegetable gardening i rent a once a year in January and turn everything and then i start putting stuff in in third week in January and there's stuff pretty much out there until the freeze hits whenever that is so i usually start off with onions and garlic and then i put in beets and then uh put out re[d]- re[d]- red beets but you can eat the tops too and then i usually put out um some kind of spinach or some type of green like that and then in April is when the tomatoes and peppers and lima beans and black eyed peas and cucumbers and all that other good stuff goes out uh each year i try something i've never tried before this year i'm trying a product called well it's called spaghetti basically it's a squash like product when you cook it when you yeah i've never tried that before each year i try something new and so this is the one i'm gonna try see if it works down here but my wife has rose bushes and she takes care of those well you know the vegetable gardens don't have to be very big this plot i have is twenty two by eight so that's a hundred and seventy six square feet which is not very big and you know if you have crops in the early spring and then crops in the summer and crops in the fall on the same spot you can put a minimum of two different crops like where i have um um onions and garlic sometimes i'll put other things you know because_1 the onions and garlics will mature in June or July excuse me hm oh they do real well i used the type called Better Boy for several years which did well but it has not done well the last couple years so in this past year i tried a new crop called Celebrity and Celebrity gave me pretty much continuous tomatoes from the um first week in June until the freeze hit in November course i think a lot of it was due to the mild weather and the rain but i had tomatoes on the table every day for five months which is in the in the past i usually got tomatoes for three four weeks and that would be it and then in the fall i'd you know get a couple more weeks but this is a very unusual year well we did have strawberries a few years ago but we don't do them_1 anymore and we had a peach tree and it was too much hassle you have to spray it and uh cover the fruit from the birds and all these other things and it just proved to be more hassle than it was worth vegetables are pretty easy i think fruit is has some difficulties of course any some vegetables are far more work than others the hard part is at the very beginning when you have to set up the garden and get everything but once the plants get going and then it's just a matter of keeping the insects off no never done that hm that's strange well you must've gotten lucky well the climate's a little better for that down there for hot weather well that's sometimes you have h[ot]- cold winters but we haven't had anything so far this year wow must be the soil um it's hard for them to go once they have no dirt there maybe you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
all right now then we should be ready to go with our conversation what are your preferences oh i've decided there's so many places in Dallas i will not make too many repeats and i thoroughly enjoy the ethnic foods yes certainly course i perhaps would enjoy Tex-Mex and that's uh a good Tex-Mex is awfully hard to beat do you p[refer]- do you care for that flavor i i i understand that uh but you don't care for the steaks uh yes i found a little place over in uh Preston Center tonight it's uh called oh i don't have the matches now but it's a its a Cafe au France and they had the it's a small place but most delightful i had not been there before and then i found with a neighbor oh couple a about a month ago this uh Salvadorian and that is on Six Thirty Five in a i don't think it was Day's Inn Motel but this woman's son had been there two or three times and their food is excellent except for their fried banana now i do not care for that but uh the the other things the seasonings were so appeal[ing]- oh wait i have a c[all]- just a second i'm sorry i didn't know i'd have that one come in but anyway that was it was very good and very very reasonable good service and the things that i look forward to i mean i want to be waited on i don't want to go cafeteria style i'd rather have them cater to me when i'm patronizing and the only time that i would go against that i[s]- would be the Sunday brunches that so many of the places have one that i have enjoyed and had the privilege of eating there New Year's Eve night was the Marriott on Six Thirty Five at Coit have you been there to eat well they had a buffet dinner which was very simil[ar]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well would you like to go first or shall i we have different communities uh-huh i think it's true yeah and and there are some areas where i believe they limit it they want you to just strictly go with the cans because_1 of the different content but i think you're right the more often you can do you have um curbside pickup in your community as well um-hum we just started it this year and it's really nice to be able to have that convenience as opposed to having to go to a local dump and you know take your recyclables i know that i am much more motivated when i know that they'll come pick it up because there can be so much that you load in your car as to as to when i had to get um-hum um um-hum oh it is and it's dirty and uh-huh uh-huh oh yeah right it seems like it would be better all the way around if there were more curbside recycling the one thing that they don't re[cycle]- uh pick up they actually don't care if we mix together the aluminum and the bottles we put those all in one big bag and then put the paper goods separately but the one thing they don't pick up are the plastic goods you know um those big milk tubs and that constitutes a big portion of our trash so i would hope at some point those things would either stop being manufactured or that that they would be able to figure out a way to recycle those economically they say on the cans or on the not the cans but the um the containers in fact that they are recyclable but i've i'm the same with you i haven't been able to at least not convenience probably outside the city limits um-hum you have to be motivated to do that when you're that far away after a point yeah well the fact that you're doing it at school with the with the kids is a great idea too because then they're also encouraged to learn about how to do that oh uh-huh i like that yes uh-huh um-hum the children oh is that the kids that you teach uh-huh um um-hum that's great um-hum and i think when the government the local or the the state government attends to support it the more happens i know that in our ho[spital]- i work in a hospital i'm a therapist and just about three years ago when we started recycling everything um they not only recognized that they could save money with all	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well how do you feel about um putting an elderly family family member in a nursing home uh-huh um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah oh i agree i it's it's a tough issue i feel like each case probably has to be evaluated individually i feel um i- i feel like as families you know we need to take care of the older ones in our families and yet i understand um well we may be facing that with my grandmother she li[ves]- is living near my parents out in California and they this year they moved her into a um retirement apartment complex so she's got part time care but as soon as she needs round the clock care then she's not allowed to live there anymore and so we'll have to face the issue of whether she moves in with my mother or they put her into a nursing home and it's it's difficult because i know my mother feels really um torn about it she doesn't want to to put her in a place where she's gonna be unhappy lonely or where there's bad care and sometimes you just don't know what the the place is like um i mean you really need to get recommendations i guess from others and um and yet it's a real burden to her to have to to be there all the time or else you know or else like you said you have to hire someone to be in the home it's a tough issue yeah um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah um-hum um-hum yeah i uh i was thinking you know it might i guess i would want to visit the place quite a bit before or something and and talk to the staff see what their attitudes are talk to some of the people that live there and see how they feel about being there um because i've been in different nursing homes where i've sensed different atmospheres you know often it's it's been negative where the and i know that partly it can be the attitude of the person if they they feel neglected by their family or whatever or they just feel ready to die and you know tired of feeling not feeling good all the time then they're not gonna feel too good but then i've i've been to other places where you know the people have told me um this is a really good place the people here really care about us so yeah yeah yeah well no um but all the years that i've been alive she has um for the last thirty years or so it's Central California yeah uh-huh yeah well this is Fresno uh-huh um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

i uh spent four years as a university professor and yeah oh do you really that's great no kidding w[hat]- i did i did um well i was pretty young w[ell]- i was uh i had never intended to do it and i was uh uh given the opportunity after i'd started a management consulting firm to teach in in uh uh one of the business schools in the California State University system at any rate um the topic is fascinating because one of the things i've done for the past few years is um research the problem from the point of view of uh uh what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically you may be familiar with cooperative learning have you ever well the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools and uh what what it involves basically is the use of peer groups and the uh teacher becomes a uh a sort of a consultant resource person to the cooperative learning uh to the learning cooperatives i guess they're called and there are uh some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people uh gain a competence with respect to the material um i think that the combination of uh technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn uh i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system uh that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster uh school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators and uh both teachers and parents uh complain about the uh uh the cost and ineffectiveness that results so my feeling is that um the the problem is is uh significant there are plenty of good people uh available to um offer people educational experience but that we just have to re[allocate]- reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it and uh i think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research um uh of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly uh accelerate the the pace of learning and my feeling is that uh those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually i don't know what form it'll ultimately take um uh but i think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for uh inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior so it must be the way we're managing the process that uh i- i don't i don't think it's it's a matter of of uh talented people to do it a[s]- both as quote unquote students and as teachers but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities in the past thirty years that weren't existent uh you must see kids with real significant problems um in some cases uh course Iowa City i don't know how hard how hard is it uh in the public school system in Iowa City is it is it uh deteriorated a lot do the people say or are they pretty happy with it or right even in Utah well Utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe yeah you s[ee]- you saw a fair number of troubled kids yeah yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well got any problems on Mockingbird with crime or is that a crime free zone you're in i'm afraid you're right oh my oh boy by your house oh my goodness ah aye aye oh my that's that's got to be a frightening way to s[pend]- spend an evening oh boy unfortunately yes yes i think uh you know as any city grows up uh you get the hoods and the riffraff and everybody else in there and i think uh you know fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek but uh we've been we've lived here sixteen years and now you you know you -[c]an tell the change for sure yes well with all the uh Central Expressway uh with all the stores and the uh restaurants and the uh convenience stores and all that kind of stuff it's just prime pickings for people driving by you know and that's that couldn't be too far from you neither uh okay_1 oh yes okay i don't know uh how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody but it's kind of kind of stupid isn't it but i guess when people do those things they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time it's looks like easy pickings and away you go right i think you're right uh although i think that may be an excuse for people too right right right just like the old alcohol idea and i think people uh i think when you have haves and have nots you're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money oh boy where do you work uh yes i think i do that uh is that Amelia -[Ear]hart School there okay that's a pretty rough area there isn't it um my goodness huh definitely that area that that's big time big time there sure is i don't think i'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself in that area gee that's the worst neighborhood in the whole c[ity]- area	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

planned a family reunion recently you know i really haven't and i know of friends who've done it recently and have really enjoyed um the the planning process but uh most of our family see each other fairly frequently so it's it's uh you know not a a major event to to try and plan it because we're all fairly close um that's wonderful oh that's great so your great-grandfather was still living and everyone up to that point was invited uh-huh wow uh-huh that's wonderful two hundred people who organized it who was the one that instigated the the planning process i was gonna ask next how she was familiar with where everyone was uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh now given the size of the group were there people were most of the families fairly large is that what contributed to that that's great that's wonderful i'm sure that was a wonderful experience for the kids too and even if they didn't appreciate it at the moment they'll probably really appreciate it later no uh uh yeah my folks uh moved from Michigan to San Diego and that's where they raised the three of us my daughter my sisters and myself but uh i would expect yeah yeah and i know that my grandparents' families were fairly large but my father has just one brother and my mom has one brother so we've kept in touch those first cousins very pretty closely um i'm not quite sure how i'd even pursue finding the rest of the folks in Michigan i think i think each of my grandparents had ten siblings so there's got to be a few of those second does that make second cousin or third cousin i'm not sure oh okay okay so perhaps my grandparents siblings would be my great great aunts and uncles right right did you find that you had a lot in common did people find out things about each other that they hadn't been aware really uh-huh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yeah yeah so what do you think do you think they're honest or they in for it themselves uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah well i was thinking if they were in for their for their own personal gain they're probably they what was that your other line or yeah but they'd probably you know they'd stay in for ten or twelve years maybe but then get out and use those contacts they made and go work as a consultant for some of these private industries that okay sure thing it's still me uh-huh yeah yeah there's actually you know you think you know they get paid what a hundred and hundred and twenty five thousand that's really not all that much compared to what yeah yeah yeah no oh and i think a lot of them go in with a you know pretty idealist approach that you know they can make some changes and stuff but i think they get in they all of a sudden find out what the real life is and yeah exactly well you look at even the President you know he's got to fight against all you know the other five hundred thirty five to get anything through anyway so uh-huh uh-huh yeah it doesn't not really conducive to getting a lot done it sure seems like uh-huh exactly yeah and like you say it's you know the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing and the d[o]- you know even mouth sometimes are do[ing]- going the opposite direction so uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah well there was that was a lot of that was p[ublic]- quite uh a public thing i mean we heard a lot about it on national news news that was that Richards wasn't that her name gal that won yeah yeah uh-huh seemed like there was more personal mud mud throwing than anything else if i if i remember the news reports and stuff but uh-huh so are they doing any good is she doing any good or uh-huh yeah yeah uh-huh uh-huh yeah did we just uh we got our first woman mayor up here in Salt Lake uh just this past election and uh you know they made a big deal of that but she's a business woman and that's what she was really pushing was business mindedness in uh you know in government and stuff and some of those in same business philosophies and it will be interesting to see how she does because you know she's kind of a self-made i don't know if she's a millionaire but she you know got her own businesses and stuff but that was her big thing that she was pushing so uh no she's Democrat which uh actually Salt Lake and the county around Salt Lake is quite a bit Democrat so it's not really surprising we've had a a a Democratic mayor for quite a few years uh the state as a whole is probably more definitely more Republican but yeah it will be a lot it will be interesting to see how she does the you know there's she's already stepped on a few toes i think she's making the changes but	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
go ahead uh-huh do you have profit sharing right well that's nice yeah my company has that too uh medical i work for a private laboratory yeah we were smaller and it it was it was a lot better the benefits were a lot better and then we bought out another lab and uh they kind of cut the benefits a little bit right right well that's not bad how oh really lowered it to what yeah to what's your deductible that's that's good right that's that's that's better than most though i right well that can help a company a lot you know if they if they're in the in the past have been giving a lot of benefits if they cut them just a little bit that'll help and then i think some employees will tolerate that instead of lowering their salaries yeah i would yeah i know they uh they raised our deductible from two hundred to four hundred a person uh-huh yeah it is but that's something i can live with you know if that's if that's what they want to stop at uh-huh right oh wow right no huh-uh we sure don't well they're they're pretty big around here too and you know the larger companies have the HMOs whereas the smaller companies don't i know our our company underwrites our own insurance which in a way i think it it could be a little bad but so far it's working out okay what H HMO are you with uh-huh uh-huh oh that's not bad and you have a retirement program and all that a retirement program and all that right yeah i've heard of that 401K used as a retirement program before uh-huh uh-huh right can you contribute to that 401K uh-huh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what are you cooking for supper that sounds pretty good what type of food yeah yeah yeah well i'm kind of a house husband and and i cook everyday it's about the only thing that huh yeah and today i made a banana cream pie my wife gets testy if i don't have some sort of dessert in the house yeah sometimes i i make things and they don't work so i kind of throw them_1 away before anybody sees them_1 but i'm a i i don't know i live out of cookbooks other than stuff that i've cooked over and over and over yeah yeah sometimes i like to get a hold of a very hard book uh and hard recipes especially some of the French dishes and where i've got to read it reread it and then keep it out while i'm cooking and you know something new not something i'm going to fix every day or something right but i guess i know for like twenty years i my wife and i both been fixing a a chicken dish from the Philippines and it's really really strong with garlic and black pepper and we've always thought nobody would like it and uh we recently served it to some guests we had and and uh they all had to have the recipe yeah and i didn't go easy on anything yeah it's it's delicious it's like when it when it's like birthday time and you say well what do you want to eat we always say Chicken Adobo and it's just it's very pungent thing and and we just didn't think anybody would like it but they all went nuts about it and i've already heard that two of them have already fixed it at home so maybe yeah where did you grow up in the Midwest okay right uh i think a lot of the lot of the things that i cook and that my wife cooks they're they're from Midwest from Iowa from her background because that's where we picked up the recipes and we have a lot of regional cookbooks from that area so it's especially when we're baking something boy we just go to those little city cookbooks and we know they've been tried and tested and and everything so yeah uh we lived in New Mexico northern New Mexico for eight years and uh no we lived up at Los Alamos so and then up in the mountains but we picked up a lot of uh Santa Fe type dishes and uh that's usually what we'll fix if company's coming because they uh they expect it yeah we don't even like to go out to the Mexican restaurants here yeah well in this part of the world there's you know there's a lot and there's some from the interior of Mexico and country Mexican cooking and things like that so you can get into some unusual things but i still find that you know especially even when we go back to Santa Fe that i'd rather have the food from there they just use more cheese and more beans and yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay i work with uh a lot of students and uh in my uh occupation talking to them about college and going to colleges i think uh the advice that i give to would give to uh parents i've had four so[ns]- five sons that have gone to c[ollege]- uh to uh college i think uh one of the main things is that they they choose a local college that uh or university that will go along with their goals as far as what degrees they want to go into and they if they're in the local area they don't have to pay out of state tuition and all of those things and uh and go ahead uh-huh yes it is um-hum uh that that's uh kind of the the advice that i give and then uh they need to take a look at the uh c[ourses]- uh the courses of study and uh how it would go into their their major minor field uh what kind of placement uh they have in the particular area you know i had one son who uh went to a smaller college uh to uh went out in the uh premed area but they had an excellent record of placing uh their students in medical schools after they finished the program and he was right he got early acceptance to a to medical school after he finished and uh if he would've gone to uh say the state uh it would be the University of Utah if he would've gone there uh i don't know whether he'd got accepted to medical school there or not um-hum yes uh um-hum and you you can do this for any of the uh any uh university or or for any of the students that are planning uh take a look at uh their final goals at least hopefully they've got a goal of what area they want to go out in and then uh if it's law school or if it's uh medical or whatever there are different uh colleges and universities usually within the state that uh have a li[ttle]- little better placement record or or getting them into into those higher degree or higher areas of education i see uh-huh um-hum you bet um-hum and uh that would be s[chool]- a school that the parents uh should seek out for their uh students if they're interested in that that field and and where it's well known uh the word gets out and that that might be a a case where even if it was out of state and they had to pay a little higher tuition then it would be well worth the the uh to to go to to Penn State um-hum yes um-hum you bet um-hum well that's very important in in a choice of a college or university that they look at those aspects uh wherever they might be and if it's uh financially if they can do that that's that's great but th[ey]- they need to know about the the costs and uh how they're going to be able to pay for this whether they can get students loans or are their parents are able to help or whatever but uh uh the bottom line is uh the the college or university that's gonna give them the best training prepare them for life	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
yes i agree with that well what we've got um in my view is is a situation where we've got more people like you say that are c[ustomed]- that are accustomed to being taken care of and than we yeah yeah well i- i really i think if you from a yeah i- i really do think that i think the first thing that we need to do and it it would be a hard uh a hard uh medicine uh for everybody to swallow but i think we're gonna have to eventually balance the budget or we're gonna sink we can't continue to pay the kind of interest that we're paying on the deficit that's true oh yeah throwing them away uh it's just like uh uh programs that are federally funded that if they if the they don't spend their allotment uh then they're then they're subject to losing the next year's allotment yeah and go into a spending frenzy at the year of the en[d]- at year end um-hum right that's true well and well a[nd]- well and so many people have have uh the feeling that well if it's if there if it's federal money then it's free money well it's not it costs everybody and uh i[t]- you know just because you can uh get something from the feds uh uh that doesn't necessarily make it morally uh responsible well and and and well don't even began to talk about the educational system i mean is that is one example where it's being proven that throwing money does not create a good education ok[ay]- yeah yeah but i'm even t[alking]- i'm i'm not even i'm not even talking about higher education w[e're]- i'm talking about the the kids that we've got now they come out of high school that can't read and write and that also it just even the ones that that do read and write that really have a very poor poor grasp of of what a secondary education should have given them uh true um-hum yeah um-hum right	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay i pushed it so what do you think um we can do to uh prevent air pollution yeah well you know what i was talking to my brother in Denver and he told me that they have restrictions on when they can burn their fireplace yeah i couldn't be[lieve]- um-hum yeah i can't unders[tand]- yeah i just couldn't figure out how could they could restrict uh you know like a fireplace because a lot of places that's all that all the heat they have in their home you know well i know yeah isn't that terrible well i don't know all i know is that we have to have our ca[r]- our car smogged every two years you know and um um-hum well you think that they would be able to do that you know i think they could too you know they just they don't wanna they wanna use uh you know something that's gonna burn all this gas where we can buy more gas you know um um-hum um-hum um-hum well i don't know about that either but uh i know i took a ride down Southern California just recently and it was just amazing to look you know like being up higher and looking down and seeing all this crud you know it oh it's terrible um-hum um-hum yeah yeah i[t]- i[t]- it does it burns your eyes and everything but a lot of these trucks that's on the road now to i think they could do something to those because some of those trucks just smoke like heck you know but it doesn't seem like no one ever does anything about that um-hum no the electric cars i think that was a good idea i would really go for that yeah right right i um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah well uh we have a fireplace here to i don't burn it every night usually i just have mine on the weekends or when i have company that we're gonna be in the house all day you know and it's just nice to sit in the living room with a fireplace going but um other than that i don't use mine yeah ri[ght]- right right yeah i know i think it's gonna have to be these large companies and uh-huh r[ight]- right right right so	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

you know i was i was thinking about that while i was waiting for the connection i i think uh you know it's uh uh a military threat certainly i don't feel like it's like it was back in the the sixties whenever Kruschev said he was going to bury us uh at the same time i i think they may still be a threat in a different sort of a way in that uh the situation over there is so unstable and and the especially the economics uh uh ramifications of whatever is going to happen over there i mean they're like a a quarter of the land mass of the earth you know and and if things don't get straightened out over there it it will impact us one way or the other i think is that right i hadn't heard that yeah or or any one of the other uh nuts that are running around yeah uh-huh yeah well it's uh i don't know it's it's amazing to see uh the kind of changes that's happened just in the past uh you know not even ten years or even five years it's just awesome yeah yeah yeah but even so he seems to be a much more reasonable person than than you know previous Soviet leaders and uh you know it's just uh uh you see this the uh you know on television the the uh shows uh on the news with the the people waiting in line they had last night i think it was on ABC where some Soviet doctors had gone on strike because their uh monthly salary was about enough money to buy them_1 six pounds of sausage with you know the new increase in prices which is you know of course doctors over there aren't held in the same rare high esteem that they have here in the US but yeah huh yeah yeah you know i i would even consider moving to Iraq for that i mean well anyway it's yeah yeah well as a matter of fact i know that uh you know they they were concerned about the Soviet brain drain because there're so many of their top people just uh like you say they they you know are are being given offers elsewhere and some of them_1 i think are even coming to the US if we can get them_1 you know rather than let them_1 uh go to one of those third world countries well i'm all for them_1 providing as you know as much support as we can at the same time you know it's time for us i think as a country to run us you know the rest of the world really is not our responsibility it's good for us to look after our own best interests even in uh you know an international way but at the same time w[e]- i don't think that we have the resources to bale out the entire Soviet Union yeah you know the amazing thing ab[out]- about it is how these people who've been operating for you know seventy generations under a uh uh you know the the p[rotectorate]- protectorate of the the government over them that they really don't even have a concept of what capitalism is a[nd]- and and as a matter of fact i'm not a guy with my company was in Moscow several weeks ago and i asked him what it was like and he said you know he said they start drinking vodka at ten o'clock in the morning but uh anyway it's uh uh i don't know there there just they've got a really uh different outlook and a different mentality than uh uh people than have anybody that has been accustomed to living uh under any form of capitalism and it's going to take quite a while for them to to realize that uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well in uh our particular area uh we're not other than uh they have a local store that you can take uh bottles and cans and different things to in their parking lot and uh in the winter we haven't been doing that but uh they don't uh that's about all they're doing yes it's a rural area uh-huh um-hum yes so that's uh that's basically what happened up here and then uh with all the recycling the price of aluminum cans went down yeah it used to be about sixty cents a pound and so people were collecting them and taking them in to re[cycle]- uh to get money for them now it's down to about nineteen cents a pound yeah that's that's what's happened and i don't know if that's from recycling i i understand it is but here uh we d[o]- we do recycle our newspapers and give them_1 to the scouts and they uh they're able to make some money uh that way but i have a son in Illinois who uh they pick it up they have a a recycling uh garbage uh pick up where they have different uh receptacles where they put it in they have some for the cans some for the bottles and newspapers and then they have the regular garbage and uh this truck comes before the garbage truck and picks uh and has separate bins to put all the glass and the plastic and all that in that seems to be working quite well there that's uh in uh Illinois yes uh-huh yeah um-hum well i've that's what they in the l[ocal]- the local paper here they were talking about that uh half about half the uh the material in the dumps is newspapers they could recycle that uh more than they do then uh um we'd be able to save a lot of trees and everything else so i've been i i i'm all for it i just don't know uh i know my son uh in Chicago where he has this they have uh uh they have to pay extra to have them pick it up even though and and so that's kind of a a burden on my uh my son even though they they put it in different containers they still have to pay extra money to do and uh um yes they do yeah um-hum right yep boy that's true hm right yeah yeah i[t]- it really does if we could just get uh people uh all over to do it now i know in uh south of us about a hundred miles south in Utah they do have a uh area where uh they bring all the garbage in and they uh they do have places to recycle and they really encourage this and uh you can bring it and you have different areas um that's a sma[ll]- ye[ah]- well it's next to Provo Utah i don't know if you're familiar with Utah at all but any[way]- it's where Bri[gham]- Brigham Young University is uh this uh there they seem to be having success and but it is a uh it's done by the it for profit making for these people and they of course are	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

Mike the subject is almost laughable is there such a thing as an honest politician oh i agree with you it's amazing Will Rogers who was in the twenties and thirties if you hear the guy that gimmicks him and uses his same material it is pertinent today as it was then uh yeah um-hum attorneys yeah did you catch that the defensive driving course you can take to get out of a ticket was recently changed from two years to once every twelve months it was also noted in some journal that the percentage of ownership of the driving schools by legislatures has greatly increased yes yes they're down there to to live off the salary of uh what they're paid and course you know the the famous joke is Japan does so good in business because they only let ten attorneys a year graduate each year and that's if fifteen had died the year before and yes yes uh um-hum um-hum um-hum and won't get reelected i agree with you a hundred percent oh i think all the w[ay]- uh all the way down to dog catchers of the city yes sir limited turn two two um-hum um-hum you go to you know get elected to another office and let somebody else pay you uh you seen the benefits that yeah the benefits legislatures uh state and senate and uh and legislatures in get after they've been there a few terms is unbelievable they get their salary for life health benefits for life oh uh uh h[ave]- have you ever noticed when what right they tried that in in Washington or was it or Oregon but speaker of the house was from there and if approved it he would not have been eligible to continue representing and being speaker and so the vo[ters]- voters kicked it said no we we since we're the one with the with the gun right now we're not gonna vote out having the gun c[ontrol]- having the power so when i- i don't LBJ's a perfect example of how somebody can be broke and get into politics and come out rich as yeah well th[ey]- they used to say in advertising that the textbook example of good competitive adver[tising]- advertising is Hertz and Avis rent a car commercials number one number two i guess LBJ has to be a textbook example of politician without any morals i don't think one of the qu[estion]- question was could they legislate laws to keep politicians honest my opinion no because_1 they won't pass laws against themselves um-hum let them_1 um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay uh Utah has a a good school system where uh as far as i'm concerned i can't really see the difficulty uh or any problems that we have other than they keep saying the ACT scores were a little low or lower than well we're a[bove]- above the national average but they're talking in the newspapers all the time that we're not doing as well as other countries in science and math which i think there's been an effort to to increase that so i don't see that there's se[rious]- any serious uh problems with our school systems here in Utah uh what about Texas uh-huh yeah we[ll]- i ha[te]- i hate to hear it huh where the students are kind of controlling the the schools then in some areas oh boy yeah that's not good uh i'd hate to teach under those situations well well that hasn't got here yet i hope it it doesn't but uh it i know we're we're starting to have a few gangs here associated with the schools yeah but that's where it begins i guess uh-huh but at least uh i i go into the schools quite a bit in my occupation the different high schools in the in the six western states that i i work in and uh generally from what i can see the uh we don't really have that type of problems in any of the states yet but i know talking to my uh counterparts back east that they're they have uh security guards that patrol the hallways and and that's not a good learning situation if you've got to have policemen there to keep kids in class and so it sound like that's it's kind of getting to that point in Texas in at least where you're at yes um-hum that's true and i i think that uh i[n]- in our Utah school systems we we've kind of reversed going from the social classes back to a lot of the academic classes that uh they feel is necessary and i think that is that's a good change to to get back instead of so many uh off the wall classes that have nothing to do with academic e[ducation]- you know education uh yes there does uh you can't uh go from one extreme to the other and th[ere]- there has to be a balance there's got to be both there but i think it should be a little stronger on the academic uh portion in order to prepare them_1 for the society today with the technology that we have they've they've got to have a good math an english background in order to compete no they're talking about uh in some of the states back here are going two hundred days a year instead of a hundred and eighty i don't know what your school year is there but um-hum we have a a there's a little of that going on here but it's all in the elementary grades it's not in the upper uh in the secondary area but i it's there's some test cases to see uh if the students are able to if they don't lose as much uh they're able to retain more where they're only out for a month instead of three months and they have to go uh-huh so it sounds like uh in your area and this area too that they're trying to work on the problem that they see as a problem to correct the s[ome]- s[ome]- some of the situations uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

-[o]kay well what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody i think they should i know i had a job until let's see a year ago this past December i was working for PIE and they closed and naturally while i was working for them i had health insurance but um for me to try to get it now uh it would cost me like over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at at pie right it really is and i think you know i think the God the government should come up with some kind of a health plan or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high well the thing is you know jobs are so hard to find you know and then what you can get out here in anyhow in the valley where i live at now they don't wanna pay anything for health insurance at all no benefits you know um yes i mean you get a job now and the wages are really low and uh yeah and they don't want uh to pay any benefits so you just you know pray to God that you don't get sick um-hum um-hum no i don't understand that either um-hum um-hum yeah well i know the plan that i had with PIE i could go to any doctor and i could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled you know then i just sent cards in and then they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine and then they would just send me a check for what was ever over that you know um-hum um-hum um-hum uh yeah that's true that's true there well yeah right um-hum but there's just so many people that can't afford to pay anything you know that people that's on unemployment yeah probably i don't know but it is it does seem to be a big problem you know i don't know what they're gonna come up with but um i sure wish they would come up with with something and uh like i say and and i'm at the age too where the i'll be fifty seven in June and the people don't wanna hire people this age any more and i worked for my previous company for twenty six years you know so it's kind of hard you know so yeah they'll be calling at my door huh but any how yeah now i I do think the government though is gonna have to do something uh with this problem because it you you know even to go to a little doctor out here just to ask him anything costs you forty bucks you know just for the visit and then he then that's not counting what medicine you're gonna buy and everything else you know and he might tell you well you know now you're gonna have to come back in a week and then that's another forty bucks plus whatever else he decides to do to you	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well Wendy have you had any uh experiences with your nieces in school to indicate that something's wrong with the school system uh-huh yeah do you think that's the fault of the school system or society or yeah yes yeah so it's really no more a failure of society no i have a friend who's a principal of a Dallas school the stories she tells oh yes with[in]- well the neighborhood that she's in is is very economically deprived and that is reflected in the students abilities i mean they have no support at home so for if you casually looked at it you could say maybe the test scores in that school are bad and and therefore there's a failure of the public school system but when the parents are not interested or don't have the resources or can't even read themselves that sort of thing it it's bound to affect the education of the children oh well i just wonder where all the money goes i mean my my taxes are exorbitant and i- i- i don't think you solve problems too much by throwing money at it i think you have to get the parents interested and have to get the community support and that sort of thing oh i'm sure it is i'm sure it is well yes and if you don't develop an interest in reading at an early age it gets that's right but again society's uh influences i think can affect how well the students perform more than this than what the public school is or is not doing i mean certainly drugs and and peer pressures of that sort can again make the students fail and therefore look like that there's some[thing]- something deficient about the public school system isn't that scary that's right but then then again that's something that that's very difficult for the schools to try to control this principal i know does the best she can in terms of dealing with students this is a grade school students who are members of gangs yes students who carry weapons to oh yeah right that's right but when there are disruptive influences like that in the school i think it makes it especially difficult for the children who want to learn	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay well um about_1 capital punishment first of all i know that in uh Texas they have lethal death by lethal injection i guess that's the uh preferred method have they used anything else in in Texas in your memory i see oh yeah that's that's kind of the euphemistic term for it um so uh have you been following the the Dahlmer case at all that one's a little too grizzly too huh um-hum hum i see um do you think that uh putting putting those people in jail permanently would be an equally good solution um-hum um-hum um-hum well certainly for for someone like Charles Manson who's very definitely going to stay in jail for the rest of his life i uh i- i can't imagine that he will ever be allowed out by the parole board that uh his life is not going to improve um do you think uh do you think that that uh the death penalty is effective as a means of retribution yeah as as as a deterrent value yeah um-hum um well to be honest i think that the uh capital punishment is is is a uh red herring in the crime and punishment business um as you said we're letting our people out far too much really the problem is that i- i think two fold number one in Los Angeles as you may know there's uh lots and lots of problem high crime areas and and uh in black parts of town the cops the cops don't trust the the people who live there and the people don't live there tru[st]- uh people don't trust the cops who who uh run the beat so in this heated air of mistrust people don't do what's necessary to keep crime down because uh you know if if uh it takes too much work or if you're liable to get beaten just because you're black or whatever things are not going to change and so capital punishment doesn't matter if the criminals who are committing the crimes don't get caught in the first place oh yeah as as uh yeah yeah exactly you know John John Singleton who's who uh made the film um Boys in the Hood noted that uh one in twenty five black men will be killed at the hands of other black men and uh that's you know for them the death penalty is irrelevant i mean it's what what difference is that going to make to them there's got to be more effective policing and there's got to be more trust on both sides of the equation	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay well hello Frances um yeah i guess when i uh first i guess i have mixed feelings about this uh subject when i first heard about it um i thought it was kind of a neat way of uh screening uh uh screening for potential problems good way for companies to weed out people with drug problems but since then i've been hearing uh well i read an article in the Wall Street Journal last year that talked about um the different results that they get from uh different labs and that uh many labs will give uh false positives especially some of the the less expensive ones and that people have been denied employment on this basis yeah uh-huh yeah there's a i know some employers have had have been able to uh reduce some tremendous problems they've had with employee turnover health problems and accidents and theft and i understand that certain jobs like if you're driving a train or plane or something of course there'd be increased need for it one thing that always kind of bugged me about it was uh there's they most of them don't test for actually the number one drug problem which of course is uh alcohol abuse and of course that you know everybody talks about all the other drugs but uh i- i understand alcohol is really still the number one health problem and the number one abused drug in in our country so it seems kind of too bad that that one's tolerated while other ones are are of you know are the ones that they focus on well see now in Texas uh didn't they only recently ban open containers in in vehicles a few years ago oh really oh yeah uh-huh right yeah yeah i expect possibly in Texas it's uh you know a an attorney knows they get in front of a jury and the jury will be thinking well i've done that before or he's just a good old boy yeah right what else how else do you drive in your pickup down the uh-huh um uh-huh um-hum well same here yeah yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
okay Bill right okay Bill have you done much camping ah ha oh well that that sounds good yes you do um now do you have a lot of mountain well you don't have mountains in Texas do you where do you find places to camp oh uh-huh oh oh my word well that sounds adventuresome well um i've done oh i would say quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and i um we have five children and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves so we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out and we have gone up into the mountains and uh not necessarily roughed it but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains and then the boys are our boys are old enough now they're twelve and eleven and so they're in[volved]- involved in the scouting and they do a lot of camping with the scouts and last year my one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week and so this year they'll both be going and so that's been real enjoyable for them so um yes they've well no actually they've i remember they have taken the the Du[tch]- the heavy cast iron Dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire and i don't think they've taken the stoves um last year they camped in tents and this year i believe it will be in tents also so uh-huh yeah oh is that right oh and what does that consist of oh uh-huh uh-huh oh yes uh see when when when we go camping here we have to take our big huge heavy sleeping bags and lots of tents and i like to sleep on the air mattresses i d[on't]- am not my bones are getting so old so i like to i like to sleep on the mattresses um so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild animals or anything like that oh my word jeez uh-huh oh oh oh uh they're covered with like a heavy armor type stuff uh-huh my word oh but they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything oh uh-huh uh-huh oh my word well that sounds a little less fierce than bears we we want to go	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so uh have you personally been involved in any trial by jury uh uh-huh yeah i was called uh once and i actually sat on a jury and it took a few weeks the case was suppose to the judge predicted it would take a few days and it just stretched out and stretched out and uh it was kind of interesting to uh in a in a in a way that kind of satisfied my uh or that pandered to my nosiness -[be]cau[se]- it was a civil case and you got to hear every little detail about how these guys had dealt with each other and uh you were invited to you know pass judgement on them well in this case we determined the award um it was two fellows a bunch of money had had uh passed from one to the other and we had to decide uh was it -[w]as it wages was it a loan that needed to be paid back uh was it you know what was it and if it was something if if anybody owed anybody any money back how much did they owe and not only how much was how much did they owe but on top of that did we want to penalize them_1 uh um-hum uh-huh well that's certainly what they're trying to do right uh at least there are two of them uh knocking off i guess i guess all they can do is knock off the people they think would be most biased against them so maybe maybe by knocking off extreme cases on both sides you end up with maybe it could be it could be worse i- i find it hard to think of something better yeah that seems like uh it seems like you'd have to ig[nore]- either ignore that i mean is it a requirement that you don't already have an opinion uh-huh uh-huh they got to have a problem yeah yeah yeah it would almost be as if if it if they could somehow say hey having an opinion's okay it's being willing to change it that's important thing uh-huh right i mean you want people who are engaged uh-huh uh well tha[t]- that was one nice thing about the civil case is that it it was nothing that had shown up in the papers you know it was just two guys the what they the only thing they looked for was if you had been in a similar situation yourself and i guess they figured you you know you would be biased in favor of which ever party you identified with it does seem like the judge has a lot of power in the first place and why give him this part also	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what do you do there in Lubbock as far as uh recycling is concerned uh-huh um-hum oh yeah wha[t]- what would be more efficient about it wha[t]- wha[t]- uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh i see yeah i- i- i- i uh i was gonna say because_1 i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for it says paper on it you know and uh if if i have a if i- i printed up something that i don't need it just chunk it in the in the paper that's true hm certainly that's a good idea yeah uh-huh well um as far as TI's concerned i'm not sure um and uh i've heard uh you know uh in residential situations i live in a dorm and i've heard in residential situations uh like in Plano um that they are doing uh stuff like having recycle picked up where uh the city uh i guess the sanitation department uh as part of their responsibility picks up uh the recycled items as well you know the plastics and the paper uh and uh aluminum and um the only responsibility of the of the patron is to separate them and then the the uh i guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them and it doesn't cost the patron anything doesn't really cost the uh department right they don't pay they don't pay for the recycled items um-hum um-hum well wh[at]- what what kind of uh services do you have there in Lubbock as far as uh where can you take your recycle items i- i lived in Abilene for a uh i went to school there at Abilene Christian and i it was so hard to uh you know if you if you wanted to recycle your newspapers it was impossible hm um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum well that's good yeah uh-huh do you tend to buy more recycled items that if if something uh in the pack says recycled and something else doesn't do would you tend to chose the one that does or um-hum hm um-hum sure yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
okay_1 so Frank what uh type of uh budget do you or your family have right that's that's sounds like uh probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have i'm single so i guess uh i don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget but i basically right i don't need to i'm the only that i have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier um and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well and uh i kind of i kind of have an idea of what my expenses are and i i'm pretty consistent from month to month and uh whenever i need to uh you know whenever that changes i'm pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it um-hum um-hum right yeah that's i guess i kind of do a similar thing more m[edium]- uh medium or longer range i just have a maybe a target amount that i'll save for like i'm probably within a year i'd like to buy a new car so i kind of have uh an amount in my mind and i'm making every effort to to put a little bit away and you know increase the amount i need for a down payment or whatever right um-hum hm right right have you thought about uh leasing i see right but if you're rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that you know typically you if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself that's right yeah mine's uh seven years old and i think last year was that was a rough year for it i had ex[penses]- a number of expenses but uh i'm hoping that m[ost]- most of them_1 were just kind of uh you know the as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brake shocks and all that so i just went through that whole set last year and i'm hoping i'll be have a slow period before i need that again right right what line of work are you in	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay what's your view what's your view yeah that's true you know even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place you know i don't know coming from Texas you're probably i don't know i- i shouldn't make stereo types but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think yeah oh you're just living down there yeah oh well yeah well i know how you feel i'm uh i grew up in Nebraska and and we always use to go out and hunt all the time you know and man there's no there's no way i would ever go for a total ban on all weapons that's just i don't know yeah it doesn't sit with me very well i don't know i anymore i keep a thirty eight in my truck you know yeah i just about all well i live in Minneapolis and i well actually i live in Florida but i am staying in Minneapolis for a year and you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now and it's just you you never know who is out there you know it's just for self protection purposes and then of course there's the hunting issue so yeah that's good but what do you do Jeff oh yeah all right yeah i'm uh researcher of Honeywell up here so uh yeah you guys uh do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything or yeah you know that's something i miss quite a bit yeah all right yeah my brother was uh a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and uh really enjoyed it quite a bit but i don't know i guess that what the scale now is it's zero for uh for a complete that's right i guess i am about eight or yeah no doubt about it but uh yeah yeah if there is if there's a way you know to limit it t[o]- to people that that i don't know they they i guess they passed a couple of uh of laws here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period where they you know you go to buy a hand gun and then they actually uh i know it's this way in Florida they have a waiting period where you buy one and that's a week and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that i think that's a pretty good idea uh and that's i don't know that's not a bad idea but then again you can always get around that you could go through the black market like you say you know you always will be able to get around yeah it's one of those things but uh i don't know i guess i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like i'm not real sure why anybody would need a fully automatic weapon you know i'm just not i think those have been pretty much you know banned altogether anyway it kind of takes the sport out of hunting you know it's like what can you do with that that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a or a or a twenty shot clip you know you might do the same thing and so it's like i don't know i[t]- it it does it takes the sport out of it for me i would much rather have a bow any time yeah i- i like bows you know i have done some bow hunting and i uh i i get into it and i think it's more of a challenge you know but uh i don't know i guess it keeps the shell makers in business but uh i don't know anyway that's about where i stand you uh have you uh you eaten yet or whatever is it seven o'clock there you guys central oh okay oh it's it's not too good it's kind of rainy actually you know it's around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about uh i don't know ten or twenty degrees and it's been up around forty so people are people are whining about the rain and stuff but not not too bad about the temperature ice is starting to melt and stuff like that so i am just up here for the year or so and it's kind of shock to	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

so do you have kids in the public school system oh yeah well i've got preschoolers so we have one that is going to be starting kindergarten next year and uh i don't know if i'm real comfortable with the public schools at this point but um home schooling right now is not an option for us so and p[rivate]- and private schools um i don't know so you have to deal with it wh[at]- what you have but um um i don't know i'm what do you think about the school systems yeah yeah yeah they're i feel like they're trying to teach a lot of um they're taking the role of the parent and trying to teach a lot of uh of values and doing a lot of baby sitting and and not getting down to what they need to be teaching and um yeah there's a lot of things that i i wanna teach my kids and i don't want them to mess around with um you know i don't feel like that's their that's their place um one of the things that uh my husband works for uh for a company that w[ell]- well he works for Frito-Lay but they had a a guy come in um talking about some of the new IBM um systems that they have coming out and talking about how school systems are just are not transitioning as as rapidly as um as a lot well i[ndustry]- industry right now is is just gonna have to uh you know well in a transition period with the computers and stuff and um that was real encouraging as i w[e]- we went and looked at the the kindergarten class that my little boy will go into and they have reading to write which is uh they can write stories and and learn to write on computers so at least uh the school district that we're in has you know computers that they begin on and i really feel like um they're going to have to use those a lot and and that way a child that my son already know already knows how to read and he will be able to excel at his own pace where the kids that you know that don't have you know that haven't had the he has a real desire to learn and hopefully he will be challenged throughout you know his school life if he's of uh you know that things are available to him like the computer that he can go off and and teach himself yeah because_1 i know there's a lot of a lot of junk that i learned in school and it's been it's been a number of years since i've been in high school and college and um they uh you know some of the stuff i learned it was such a such a waste of time and um i come back and i got a degree in in uh i got a business degree in college and that's the most useless it's like why did they do this to people and um so you have to you know you have to uh you really have to work with um what's out there in the environment and use it to your advantage in the schools right now it's just they're just beginning i think to to take advantage of the computers and and of course not all schools are able to do that because of the expense of them but um yeah um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
so what do you think about caring for older folks Dale uh-huh right very definitely uh-huh well i'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old They aren't really that old but they are sort of wearing out My mamma is a dialysis patient and she is only about sixty four but she's had some pretty close calls and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now and so she's phasing out and but she's also a very very very independent person and doesn't like having having people uh not being able to do things for herself when she wants to uh i know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home but my daddy keeps talking about it i don't i couldn't possibly couldn't never see him in a nursing home and my grand daddy also doesn't like wouldn't want to be in a nursing home he's ninety i think right on ninety right now and he's living by himself My grand mamma died a couple of years ago so but he's you know as long as you can have the families take care of the people i'd like to see them stay at home uh-huh uh-huh right right right especially for your uncle i bet now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in Philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with Alzheimer Do they have anything like that in Dallas right So they are pretty limited oh another interesting thing another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives to make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities i don't think that was mainly with Alzheimer's patients but just patients in people in general who were not as independent as they use to be uh-huh right uh-huh right to need uh get there and to participate in the activities right right that's true You can't play those things but you can sing songs and uh tell stories about the old times i guess you know you were talking about you're was it your grand mother that was having Alzheimer uh being able to tell old stories You can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way do they like to listen to other people recollect though right well that is good because we	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

um so do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time uh-huh uh-huh i agree uh with with both of those things but uh do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest um-hum um-hum um yeah um-hum uh-huh uh-huh uh the the only prob[lem]- the only problem i see with term limitations um is that i think that the bureaucracy in our government as is in with most governments is just so complex that there's a very lar[ge]- you know there there is a learning curve and that you know you can't just send someone off to Washington and expect you know his first day to be an effective uh Congress person uh i think i think there really is a there's a lot they need to learn you know when you get there uh-huh yeah but uh um-hum um-hum yeah uh the other the other thing that that uh bothers me about our system is just that um in for for in in in Congress the amount of power any any particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they've been there so it's you know for you know uh so unless you have actual you know across the boards uh limitations the uh you know the idea of well we're going to just we're i'm i'm just going to you know vote vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work you know it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh yeah uh-huh well i mean i don't see why it makes a big difference the CIA because you know officially they don't do they don't have any operations within the United States other than administrative uh-huh uh-huh uh um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
oh let's see um crimes and circumstances actually i'm i'm against capital punishment um probably not for the reasons that a lot of people are i'm against it because i really don't think that uh there are any crimes that warrant executing a person and the reason i think that is because i really don't have the belief that uh any particular person's life is worth so much that you ought to take this other guy's life for it i think you can either you know put him in jail for you know for some very long period of time or if they're really you know mentally ill then i don't think they can really be held accountable for their actions anyway so uh i just i i'm just basically against it uh i also i also don't have enough faith in our our criminal justice system to to avoid getting the bloopers in there once in a while uh-huh well is isn't locking somebody up i mean equivalent to that yeah do you i yeah yeah actually see i'm i'm sort of uh there are there are some other things i'm a[gainst]- i'm against also i thi[nk]- i think that jailing people for a really long period of time is is tantamount to sort of cruel and unusual punishment which i'm also against so and so so i'm sort of in this quandary you know i mean either you have ei[ther]- either you execute them_1 and uh you're done with it or you know you throw them_1 you throw them_1 in jail for some incredibly long period of time and then i think well i wouldn't you know you you don't want to be cruel to these guys and they say by throwing them_1 in a jail where they're you know they're constantly abused or what other other brother or uh o[ther]- other cell mates you know so so you kind of get into this hotel phenomenon you know where you got to set up you know some incredibly safe rubber room but you know then when you set up the rubber room you know it's so uh it's so antiseptic that it's almost drives the person crazy if he isn't crazy already and so isn't that cruel and unusual punishment um on on the other hand i think there a lot of individuals who probably haven't really signed up to the idea of you know our co[ncept]- i mean most western people's concept of civilization you know and i i mean western in the sense of just you know western philosophy i guess um but you know i i kind of don't buy into the idea that uh that to have a society you necessarily have to to you know terminate somebody if they have stepped across that line because_1 i think there are probably a lot of instances where um you get into a situation where somebody hasn't really signed up to being in that society and i mean they kind of consider it almost they're protecting themselves or something and if society well for instance if society sort of forces themselves on somebody you know you hear it once in a while you hear about these incidences where uh some guy is you know off there in the wilderness or something you know and and and he just doesn't wanna be part of society and society kind of invades his turf you know makes him wanna or you know makes him makes him sort of abide by their rules when he really wasn't even known to society before and he winds up you know shooting somebody or you know killing a cop who's trying to get him to you know come in to pay his there's a million there's a million things you know that i can ima[gine]- million scenarios that i can imagine where the guy would be sort of like hey i don't wanna be in this society you know leave me alone you know and he'd fight back and if he killed somebody you know he'd get the death penalty you know	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay_1 so what are what are your views o[n]- on capital punishment yes so are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state yes that's similar to Georgia uh that's probably true considering yes yes um i guess in a way that it it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if yes right that would be the intent of it well i think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner if there weren't so many appeals yeah if if the person who's gonna commit the crime knew that they were gonna be punished severely possibly capital punishment uh i'm a research engineer i work uh f[or]- with Georgia Tech um yes hum um-hum um that's probably true but i guess there's other factors that but pu[mping]- pu[mping]- pumping more money into the school system is a good thing but it's not gonna oh i see um-hum um so that's a difficult situation um um-hum um-hum well that's probably true wh[at]- hum yeah i guess that's not an easy solution there's there's no easy solution for that um-hum i'm sure it is yeah hum yeah i don't i don't certainly capital punishment isn't gonna solve a lot of problems but uh i guess i am for certain cri[mes]- yeah in certain crimes um premeditated murder crimes of that nature i think should definitely any mass murderer type individual hum um-hum well you always have yes i read about that um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
Wendy i guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if uh if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that uh let me ask you the question do you have a uh budget or a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to um-hum uh-huh i see i see well good i'm i'm kind of in a different situation but i- i- i went through that too when i was in school but uh i was i was working to get through college and and uh trying to make it through that but uh i'm married and have uh a couple of children and we have to uh pretty much stick to a budget i'm on a salary so i don't get any overtime or anything like that so but we have a fixed income and we have to make sure that uh every dollar we have is is spent accordingly and um what we try and do to to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have you know the house payment we have the insurance premiums um utilities and so forth and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside and we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the coll[ege]- the kids' education college education the future and uh set aside money for bonds and and we also set aside an emergency fund because_1 we've uh we've been married for about ten years and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh it's not enough to go in to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for and uh then we have you know whatever's left over is disposable in[come]- disposable dis[posable]- yeah discretionary income that we use for the rest of the month so and it's worked out very well it's uh it's helped us so that we haven't been you know too long on the month and too short on the money and uh try and stick with that and nice thing about it i uh my wife is is excellent in that we both work together we both have a budget and we stick to it and there's no surprises in that well actually i have four kids so yeah i said a couple of kids i- i guess i should have specified i have four four little boys yeah you bet you bet all right um-hum yes uh-huh oh well good good uh-huh yes well what year are you in college you're a sophomore so you have a few more years uh-huh well good for you good for you yeah i imagine it uh is a little difficult to stick with a budget during uh during school and so forth yes well great great and sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on too lab fees oh yes oh yes well you're not a starving artist yet are you good well good there there's enough of those in the world huh good good i'm glad to hear that Wendy w[ell]- who's who's not very well educated oh yes yes that's true that's true i've found that out so that's why i'm planning and and preparing for the uh education of my children also try and set that money aside i majored in business administration and um yeah but uh once again	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
all right uh i think we pay a little bit too much in taxes and we don't always get what we pay for yeah no yeah i- i kind of feel the same way you know you pay all this money into Social Security and then you're not gonna get anything back out of it you know because_1 you're paying for everybody that uses it now and it's not gonna be there when you need it yep yeah um-hum yeah yeah well well well well i think some of the taxes that pay you know you're paying more for the people to to disburse the money out than you are for uh the money to be spent you know like on education and stuff yeah so i- i feel like some of like i said some most of the taxes that we pay are not being used for what they're supposed to be used for yeah uh yeah and and they like they use taxes to to make grants to people that you know they wanna find out how come butterflies do fly and all other kinds and i think that's kind of stupid um-hum yeah yeah and yep uh yeah i can understand that because_1 and uh it's it you know like you said it makes you upset and it makes me upset too when i hear stuff like that and i just heard on the news tonight where they all them people in Congress overdrafted themselves and they you know finally gonna come out with everybody's name now saying who done it so yep oh yeah oh yeah uh oh yeah uh that and you know like a lot of our tax money goes to helping other countries and stuff and i think we ought to use a lot of that money here in the states before we send it to someplace else	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay i guess we can just go ahead and start so what i did while they were uh a matter they i made some notes while they were calling around and they called quite a few different number before anybody answered is uh some notes that i wrote down about our budget and that is uh the biggest problem that we have is that uh my wife and i both work and i get a fixed amount and i'm paid once every two weeks and my pay check always the same she also get paid once every two weeks but her pay checks don't come at the same time mine do and she doesn't get a fixed amount every everytime she gets paid and so trying to put together a budget from pay dates that are different and change all the time and where her amount change uh has been probably been one of the biggest budget problems that that we have and uh so what we've done is kind of taken everything that we have had to pay out over a an extended period of time and then tried to average it so that we could approximate how much each bill would be and then budget our pay checks accordingly base on the minimum amount that we would expect to receive and that's that's been fairly effective hum you mean like recently right exactly and that's uh that recently happen we had to have break jobs on both of our cars and uh so then we end up doing a couple of things uh dipping into saving is one and uh scrimping on other thing to uh get the extra money and then uh also we've got uh a an investment plan with a mutual fund and that's kind of like a savings account so between all of those varies sources and uh that is obviously not a very good way of doing thing so uh no right don't even have one um-hum yeah right um-hum um-hum uh-huh hum a different account huh um-hum so you can the her money and then save it or right um-hum uh-hum right um-hum right a valuable uh budget yeah um-hum right um-hum um-hum hum we've got bill for example like the uh car insurance you mentioned that come and and this is the other problem when it comes to budgeting is that we have bills that don't come on a uh monthly or or once every two week bases like we get paid the the car insurance comes every three months so that means that uh uh everytime because we haven't uh disciplined ourselves where we can have a uh certain amount set aside each month for when that bill comes we end up paying that whole bill every every three or four month and then that cuts into everything else on it um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so uh how do you feel about capital punishment huh yeah i have no idea what the law is anywhere i've ever lived i don't know so i i personally uh even though i understand the principle behind capital punishment i don't agree with it ever a[pplying]- applying capital punishment to anyone um because_1 i sort of believe that if we've got a person arrested that sure we can uh we can say you know it's a murderer he's done heinous crimes but we can keep him in jail for the rest of his life and not give him a terribly pleasant existence and uh there's just no reason to justify killing a person a[nd]- you know there may be an economic reason but i don't think that's sufficient to justify uh killing someone if you believe that killing is wrong y[ou]- you might as well apply that to you know even that s[tays]- stays true even if you're punishing someone i know that's how i feel yeah we[ll]- it's just that i feel like they don't really pose a threat if they're imprisoned you know sufficiently and you know i- i- i guess it would be bad if the politics ever changes and they got out for some reason but uh yeah oh yeah but the thing is you know when these guys get out it can be so quiet you may not notice i mean if the public doesn't hear about it for some reason i mean the thing is Charles Manson was really publicly well know but if it's somebody who's you know a serial killer but he never was really in the media a lot then when he gets out he still won't be in the media yeah so i you know uh it could be bad if somebody got out i guess uh-huh uh-huh well there have to be because uh uh i don't know there's like well i don't know the numbers but i mean there's at least dozens of capital punishments every year from what i that's what i think it is and you know you don't hear about all of those uh-huh right yeah i do[n't]- i don't know either so right yeah they're against capital punishment oh okay we[ll]- aren't do a lot of coun[tries]- countries not have capital punishment that'd be interesting to find out who doesn't yeah right	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
no i don't watch that one um i get a lot of my news from uh odd sources if it isn't uh public radio or the local listener supported station i get a lot of it off of the uh the nets Usenet BBS networks and uh monthly and weekly magazines and newsletters you ever heard of a magazine called Mondo 2000 fairly obscure it's published out of Berkeley it's a futurist magazine apparently i heard about it later the guy started it as a on inheritance money he just wanted to have a magazine of his own and he wanted to be future oriented so it's really fringe science um new chemicals brain enhancement technologies virtual reality all that stuff that we're just starting to hear about this whole magazine covers it and then from that i can follow up on other sources and a lot of the stuff in there turns up on bulletin boards as people talk about it uh depends on what it's about and who's writing a lot of this stuff is just reporting somebody may be developing some new technology and they'll be talking about the plans for the use of it it's not the kind of thing that would be really talent you know it's not something that's questionable like political opinions it's sort of a state of technology and what are we going to do with this and what do you suppose would happen if the government got ahold of it and you know that kind of thing and then uh you know the the the best source of news the comic strips not really oh yeah absolutely and Bloom County now Out Land and all the rest of them_1 but yeah Doonesbury is great i mean sometimes h[e]- that doesn't even try to be funny he just puts stuff in that strip that we're not going to see anywhere else and uh uh like when he was quoting an entire week from Bush's speeches and the guy was completely i think that's when it finally they had to issue a press release that Bush was under the effect of this weird drug that uh has been banned in some European countries and that it was affecting his yeah that's the one go back to 60 Minutes 60 Minutes i always watch 60 Minutes yeah i used to watch them_1 but then i caught them_1 in a bald face lie and i ha[d]- didn't really care anymore it was a long time ago they just did a hatchet job on ultra light aircraft and i used to fly one so i knew what i was talking about and they really i mean it was a classic case of what the conservatives accuse the liberal press of doing you know they fabricating uh m[aking]- making one picking an item out of context and blowing it up i mean it was just such a classic yeah they did that i[t]- who damn themselves and then there they are doing it too so you just have to watch you know you have to assume that with every story you're watching or everything you're reading what what special interest could they possibly have that they would make them slanted this particular way if you assume they're biased and then look for some opposite biases you get a fairly good idea of um-hum um-hum oh yeah sound bytes all they'd rather do is give you a little sound bytes they do i[t's]- it's so funny they talk about the liberal press but m[ost]- most every well virtually every TV station and almost every newspaper in the country is owned by conservative well off white businessmen and they have to be conservative because they have this multimillion dollar investment to protect and they're beholding to their advertisers they have to be conservative but the writers a reporter i mean if you're going to be in the business of reporting if you're a journalist uh you get cynical and uh cynicism can sometimes be confused with	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so how do you like the benefits of TI oh that's right yeah yeah tha[t's]- that's one problem with uh engineering jobs is it's you you really need some sort of more flexible or portable pension you know something more like a either 40[1K]- well i guess you get part of into 401K one oh 401K but what what is the uh key heal[th]- plan that people who are privately employed use right um-hum yeah what also seems like a lot of company set the benefits based on your last salary when you left the company so you know let's say you've worked there for twenty years you stopped working there you go work for somebody else for fifteen years and because of inflation alone um you know your twenty years is worthless just because it's it's not an index to fund it's based on the actual dollar amount of when you worked there yeah i[t]- be[nefits]- benefits in general um-hum well that's one thing you do get with a large company they're you know it's well it's actually can go both ways someth[ing]- some ways you have more opportunities because_1 there're so many things going on within the company but you also may get key holed and you are a ex type person therefore you should only work on this type project and that i guess to some extent depends on the philosophy of the company and whether they pigeon hole people or allow people to go in t[o]- to any area they want to yeah the[re]- there was some clicking on the line i'm not sure what whether that's local or somewhere in the long distance network between New Jersey and wherever you are California okay this is also possible somewhere between Texas um-hum well it depends on where you go if you go up uh far enough north it doesn't it gets cheaper again but then again there's y[ou]- y[ou]- um-hum yeah i know New Jersey is just slightly above the national average which was yeah it's about twice the price of Atlanta but uh the hou[sing]- the housing prices have definitely dropped yeah co[st]- cost of living cost of housing is the salary enough to allow me to do the activities i want to do yes	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
well this is something i just got back from working out yes um i'd spend about five or ten minutes stretching and then i i used to be just a walker i i was really into walking about_1 three miles everyday and i'd go to the weight room and a[nd]- and get in every part of my arms and work on legs but now i'm training to run and i i fun run here in Tyler and it's just two miles but um i'm up to running a mile so i walk real fast for two miles which takes me about thirty minutes and then i'll run a mile and then i'll cool down and feel like i'm going to die but it's a lot of fun for me i[t's]- it's a task when i don't feel like it but most of the time it's fun huh no um in college and the junior college i'm going to right now has a really good fitness center and so they have a cardiovascular room where they have a Stairmaster and sometimes i do that i kind of got burned out on the Stairmaster and uh they have a real good weight room and i do a lot of free weights free weights more than machines i enjoy those more uh-huh uh-huh y[eah]- yeah yeah it['s]- it's pretty difficult for me too but i've got one month to train for the two mile run i'm fixing to do and that's not very fu[n]- f[un]- fu[n]- you know that's not very far to run and a month isn't very long and they call it a fun run i don't see how they can put fun a[nd]- and run together and i'm running to get in shape yeah i'm in i'm in really good shape now but uh i've only been seriously in a workout program since September so i'm knocking close on a year just to be you know m[ean]- you know almost but um i'm just i really i had a partner last semester in school that was into body building and he'd been in it for about three years and so he really got me into lifting weights and i and i did that a lot for the first time i i g[ot]- i went into a weight room in September and it was real intimidating i was one of the only girls and that didn't help any but uh i got started into that and i ended up gaining uh almost ten pounds from muscle just in musc[le]- well i i had a bigger appetite too so n[o]- i actually i lost size but i gained in weight you know because of muscle but now i'm trying to to get rid of some of the bulkiness and my arms got quite a bit bigger and i i didn't really want them_1 to get that much bigger so now i'm i'm doing they say to define your muscles you do a lot less weight and a lot of repetition so that's what i'm working on now well um i go Monday through Friday i walk and run but um yesterday i wasn't feeling good so i missed Monday and i'm out of town on Friday so i'm going to have to go on Saturday so i'll at least get four days in but uh uh-huh uh-huh ooh right yeah do you live in the mountains oh uh-huh uh-huh do you have any kids oh my goodness eighteen months you get a little of exercise in on that well i'm going to wait a long time till that happens i'm i'm i'll be twenty May sixth and i'm just going to get through college and hopefully move to some different states and stay single for a while but in the mean time i'm i'm trying to stay in shape and i i love to play racquetba[ll]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
well um i live at the beach and and we don't really have a lot of recycling here but you have do you have a lot in Rochester okay oh so they just pick up everything well i think they do some voluntary on the beach but i live in apartments and we don't have it here um in Wilmington they have it there more i think and that's like the big town near us but um i really wish they would have it well sometimes i don't feel so bad i mean it's really i mean i[t]- this is really sad too because we have a big dumpster at our apartments and there's this little man that goes through our trash all the time to get the cans out i know uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah well i mean they do some but none of it's mandatory and like i said i live in an apartment complex and so they don't do it for us but some of the houses i've seen some of the bins around some of the houses there is a place but it's in Wilmington and so it's like a a big hassle you know to try to get everything together and i mean uh you'd have to save it up and have all that stuff lying around your apartment it's um about twenty minutes um-hum i know but i just think it's it must be hard to do in an apartment thing like this really um-hum yeah now see th[at]- i think that's why it's not as strict in the south it's because we still ha[ve]- have a lot of land left so i mean but i mean people do need to realize that that there's not always going to be land um-hum but i know i went to see my brother in Philadelphia in May and he was in a voluntary program	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
hi this is David from Florida Lee okay uh oh wow so it's getting warmer up there then huh it's it's cooling off down here it's going to get down to probably around sixty tonight so yeah just as beautiful during the day though i work down here for Pratt Whitney and i heard about this over the TechNet on the uh on the computer there at work we get uh electronic mail all the time uh not news groups no not really i'm an engineer there okay yeah and what do you do oh okay okay well it's getting kind of late so you want to get started here we're going to talk about taxes i guess you probably talk all night about this okay okay then uh you want to go ahead and start or do you want me to go ahead and start when we okay i'll i'll i'll let you go ahead and start and then i'll i'll press the one now are you ready here we go oh you wh[y]- why do you think uh we're not getting our money's worth you probably see the waste first hand then um-hum yeah right well the the thing that makes me angry about paying taxes i don't mind paying it for services you know for defense uh the country and uh and and for services like roads and for sewage and and for basic water and stuff but when we got to pay for uh some of these people that are on welfare and stuff that's when i get uh i get pretty mad uh i mean i think a lot of that is wasted yeah right i i[t]- yeah yes yeah tha[t's]- that's tha[t's]- that's true uh i'm not sure what to do about it though uh you know this is a big election this year and everything we all these guys running for president and uh i um-hum yeah what's no no i don't i don't think we are d[o]- d[o]- um i- i don't agree with oh you mean by us paying taxes is a poor step we are doing that indirect oh yes i agree i think that's the way the well yes i- i do agree with yeah i- i thought you but i personally was doing that no i i don't think we're standing in the way but i think that the way the welfare system is set up yes it does kind of foster that kind of an attitude with people when they can just sit around their porches all day and uh still get a check at the end of the week i think that's uh pretty pitiful especially when they're able bodied people yeah well the you know the the thing is we get these people in there that are like career politicians and they're grieved by so many people and they're	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

did you attend public school uh-huh uh-huh yes that's true they can't root out the troublemakers as easily okay yeah i never yeah yes vocational education we called it uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and by spreading thin you mean they too many students or too many subjects per teacher or uh-huh um-hum um oh uh-huh uh-huh that's kind of technical so he could h[im]- it was him yeah um-hum uh-huh were already paying this guy yeah yeah uh i did i did and uh i felt i got a very i mean i feel i got a very poor education in general uh but i think that i knew other people from other public schools who got better educations um uh in our case it think it was you know the teachers uh again spread thin but maybe in terms of just having too many student to really do the job um i'm sort of i have a two year old son now and so i'm starting to think about education you know more critically and trying to figure out what we want to do and i'm just sort of turned off by the whole uh the whole system where everyone sits facing the front of the room as quiet as possible while the teacher lectures uh especially for small children uh it just seems like it's not the way they're going to learn best but when you have one teacher and thirty students what else can you do you know i mean it seems like the the style of teaching that we we have grown to think of as normal i think is dictated by economics in just in terms of uh student teacher ratios um um no so far i'm just whining i haven't done anything constructive yet uh we fantasize about homeschooling but uh we probably won't although i could see where that would be that could be a lot of fun	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

i'll start in the first place i don't have a family and i don't have a budget and it's called what yeah in my case um i i turns out that i have a pretty good job right now but i grew up in a family that was fairly poor my dad was a college teacher and a high school teacher and we weren't really destitute but we never really had a lot of money so i never really got in the habit of spending a lot of money and so now i just it turns out that i spend less than i make so i never really bother to keep a budget uh-huh so you don't keep actual records of what your expenses are and what your inco[me]- what you income is and stuff oh so you do keep track of it do you actually balance it at the end of the month oh well i just started balancing my checkbook for the first time in my life since i've had a check[book]- and i'm i'm thirty two now so for i guess fourteen or fifteen years i've had a checking account but i've never actually bothered to balance it i just always made sure there was enough of money in there if i wrote out a five hundred dollar check i'd transfer five hundred dollars in and i never actually checked to see if my balance matched the bank's and the other day i was well a couple months ago i started thinking you know i should really do that and i had just learned learned how to use Lotus on a PC and uh with Lotus it was pretty easy to set up a a little checking program so i could so it'd keep the balance for me uh-huh so that comes second nature to you yeah my i still haven't balanced i figure if i keep do[ing]- keep this up long enough eventually someday it'll balance and then at that point then i can try to keep it balanced yeah well you spend more time on it than i do that's for sure does your balance ma[tch]- balance match the banks at the at the end of the month uh-huh oh i don't get that i just get a letter that says we just charged you ten dollars please take care of this eighteen oh so you get a personal call but you also get the charge uh-huh right yeah you like to live on the edge i see uh-huh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
what kind of car do you have uh-huh yeah how do you like your Ford maybe that's a good sign yeah yeah i think they have that tendency i've got a Ford Ranger that i drive and uh i just had it uh oil oil change and lube done to it but before that about two weeks ago somebody busted out my w[indow]- my passenger window so i had to go get it replaced well yeah i they uh i had a uniform my band uniform hanging in there and they stole that so that was kind of kind of a bad thing but yeah it's pretty distinctive i don't know what in the world they wanted with it i think it was just kids you know neighborhood kids or something yeah yeah actually uh uh-huh all right well actually with regard to Ford the the truck has not been too bad to me but i don't like Ford a[t]- at all the company itself because i did have a few problems and they've been utterly non responsive so whoever i meet i always tell that to them_1 just to make sure yeah yeah tha[t]- that's great is is Raleigh so big or or or or is it so busy that you can th[at]- that you can't get in very well or or how does that work there hm that's good see i i live in Orlando generally but i'm up here for a year and then i go back down to Orlando and down there there are no appointments you go first come first serve which makes it really kind of difficult if you work but uh no down there i haven't had much luck except for one Ford dealership in Gainesville Florida that's really very good Gainesville oh you mean Minneapolis' a long way two two and a half a two and a half well my family lives in Gainesville so occasionally i go up there and and it it ha[ppened]- it so happened that my gear shift lever broke off at the stem when i was in Gainesville so i i had to i had to drive it about fifteen miles an hour the way to to the Ford dealership but kind of an interesting thing wow and the first oh the first figure you gave me twenty four hundred i've got one for you if you uh reverse the first two digits of that and make it forty two hundred that's approximately what i spent in two years on a seventy four Volvo i had it was constantly giving me problems no this is strictly uh structural and engine repairs things that had to be done like new new transmission i was really upset because_1 i was a an undergrad college student at the time and not making a whole lot of money so uh it was that was one car that i really i liked it a real love hate relationship with it i liked the car because it felt good and it and it drive it drove well when i drove it but then again it had all these problems so it uh was kind of a bitter sweet relationship i guess	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i've got some pretty firm feelings on this one and that is that we are definitely not getting our money's worth um primarily uh i think the one big thing that stands out among all this is uh the amount of money that our taxes go to to pay for interest on the federal deficit which is just an absolute inexcusable waste it's terrible you know it's huge i have no idea what the actual number really is but it yeah i think that the people that um orchestrated this and engineered our having the deficit should have appreciated you know what it was ultimately going to cost it was a very bad decision to start letting that grow hum yeah absolutely yeah absolutely and th[at's]- that's a terrible problem as well um-hum um-hum well as much as that's a bad thing i think that uh there's some other really major major things that need straightened out and you'd mentioned waste a little while ago and uh i've seen with my own eyes a tremendous amount of government waste i was in the marine corps and we had uh several hundred thousand dollars worth of transformers sitting on the wall that had been contracted out to be built as replacement parts for an old Westinghouse Radar Westinghouse wasn't going to support it anymore and Spencer you know Spencer Gifts that company said they'd go ahead and build these things and they didn't build them to specifications so they were unusable they were too physically large to go back in and we spent um four thousand dollars apiece on those things and there they just sat there taking up valuable space in front of everybody and they were there the whole time i was down there uh-huh uh no yeah i really wish there was some solution to this bureaucratic obesity that just seems to be prevalent in every sort of administration or administrative thing that gets so big um not limiting taxes di[dn't]- hasn't stopped uh the government from spending they just went ahead and spent it and now we've got this giant deficit on top of things uh-huh uh-huh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
do you feel about the issue of uh random or spot drug testing um-hum yeah i- i tend to believe that that it's it's important for those jobs where uh where the the person has the safety of other people uh in their own hands or within their control then i think it should be mandatory you know the the airline industry the transportation industry um you know the uh the defense and military you know any any application like that i think it should be mandatory right um-hum yeah right um-hum right right yeah y[ou]- you you know you can easily envision the one one mistake could you know ruin a a career that couldn't be uh you know couldn't be resurrected yeah no yeah yeah right yeah right huh yeah definitely yeah i don't really feel like you know for any any of the just routine jobs that people should be subject to that kind of invasion of privacy um only for the only for the ones where it's critical right right yeah i- i guess i would feel that the you know police uh that the police should be one of those public uh safety issues where you know drug testing where it would be favorable uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
yeah Jonathan uh y[ou]- you s[ay]- you say it's near and dear to your heart buying a car is uh something you're contemplating i take it ah uh-huh uh uh-huh wow you get uh-huh what do you think you'll uh what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next um-hum uh-huh right uh-huh well i think the next car we get will probably be a well i- i like Buicks we have a Buick Century now it's a nineteen eighty seven and uh whatever i get i wanna have uh air bags uh both driver's and passenger side and a four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to you know rather than have them_1 stoop down to get over so i think the four door is probably a major requirement and other than that uh you know reasonable cost and safety and uh as much economy as you can get out of a car uh you know i'm not looking for one with a great big engine uh something that'll carry it around safely i guess is best best way to describe it right now we've got a V-6 in it and that seems to be just fine i know they s[aid]- they're coming out with some V-8s now and i think that's probably a little overkill for this day and age um-hum right i uh i drive a a truck a Ford truck i i like trucks because they're spacious and it's handy to haul things uh it's not related to my business i just you really use it basically for transportation but there's so many occasions when i've had to move some members of the family or do this or that it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one traction uh not really um you know it's a two wheel drive truck and i figure if it's so bad that i need a four wheel drive i probably ought to be home anyway wow hm uh-huh what kind of what make is the mini van Mazda i see uh-huh right um-hum one of my sons has a a Plymouth uh van or you know uh uh that same type of thing the Voyager i guess and uh they have a a child that's five years old and it's really handy for hauling him around and and their stuff and of course as he gets friends i'm sure that'll be even handier so i know if we were if we had kids still at home we're in our fifties now but if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value uh what about uh all wheel drive is that something that you'd be interested in or is that a not an issue um-hum uh-huh right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the last auto repair i had was i have a nineteen eighty four Nissan truck i had a a tune up done and i had the i had the brakes done on it and the the reason i did that was because i don't have a scope and it has eight spark plugs and it's hard to to get get at them_1 and plus the time i just don't have time anymore um as far as maintenance tasks that i do myself i i usually change the oil and wash the air filter and i- i had an occasion to change the had to change the the battery once but the brakes i was really surprised with the brakes i wanted i do have the background i know what needs to be done and i know the the oil needs t[o]- should be changed re[gularly]- very regularly and all of the bearings and and and the lubri[cation]- lubrication system needs to kee[p]- be lubricated and so i- i stay on top of that but i- i wanted my front wheels i wanted the bearings packed and they wanted something like fifteen dollars uh up front or something like that or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it just to pack the bearings but what i found is that they had a brake job and they ch[anged]- i had them_1 another thing i- i let them_1 do sometimes is that i let them go through and let them tell me what let them do the diagnostics that's free okay and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it see and they told me that my my brake pads were you know percent still good you know but still it was cheaper in the long run and uh so i just got the the the brakes done and i thought that was a good deal and and plus and they we repacked the the wheel bearings yeah but i've i've had considerable experience i you might say i'm a me[chanic]- a good back yard mechanic and i you know i took auto shop in high school it's been a while back but i- i still have a pretty good feel for it but one thing i didn't know is that when i was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars i ha[d]- i had bigger cars and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those but what i was surprised at is that on my little Nissan i bought the truck with about sixty thousand i have almost a hundred and ten so i drove on those brake pads for uh you know forty five thousand miles and there was hardly any wear to them_1 so those small little trucks and cars like that th[ey]- they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good ex[actly]- exactly so i you know but i- i just did it anyway i like to st[ay]- i like to stay up on it you know like to st[ay]- kind of stay up on it then if you go in like just about any point any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil the oil is you might say a a light golden brown you know it's not dirty i- i- i keep it that way because that's that is the key to the longevity so s[o]- so how uh-huh uh oh uh-huh um-hum okay um-hum you're talking about_1 the vibration dampener that's the vibration dampener yeah okay hm uh oh hm uh oh hm um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
wha[t]- what's your uh you are you into the Cowboys or what oh yeah that's all right yeah well i don't know i kind of go back and forth uh depending on whose really hot and whose not i guess i'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects but uh i guess if i have uh my druthers i'd probably go for the Seattle Seahawks i kind of like them yeah they're kind of you yeah to be honest with you i- i probably watch uh college a little bit more than i do pro yeah i kind of like college actually quite a bit is it yeah yeah that could be yeah yeah you probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then no i root for Nebraska quite a bit yeah yeah well i can see i can see definitely how you could get into that i to be honest with you i find that that too much running gets pretty boring as well and right sure well i think they're starting to realize that a lot of the like the big eight teams that used to run so much i think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore right ye[ah]- yeah so uh what's a this World League is coming in uh that's getting ready to start up right have you followed that very much or yeah yeah right it can take over a small market share but nothing really right yeah i think i agree with you it's it's kind of interesting to see uh to see their claim of you know like world football but when in reality it's really Americans playing yeah actually uh i kind of like soccer i've never really played it but uh i like the idea it's it's an interesting game to watch that and rugby i like to watch rugby every now yeah whatever you wanna call it there yeah there's an element of there's definitely an element of stupidity in there yeah right exactly yeah that yeah you've played it then no i doubt it you know not least not in this country anyway yeah it is they really are yeah uh no i don't to tell you the truth i'm okay to tell you the truth i'm not even really from here yeah i'm i'm up here for a year on an internship but i- i actually live in Florida yeah well you know i i mean who who who the heck is gonna root for Tampa Bay right i mean i guess i could go for Miami but i don't know i'm from i root for Nebraska so i'm i don't have a real love for anyway but i don't know i like i said i- i get into pretty much any game that's out	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
so do you your privacy being invaded at any time right yep yep there's a lot that you you can still yeah i have always done that i started once i found out that that's really not necessary or legal then i just refuse and i say what are you gonna do you gonna say you don't wanna sell me this product then that's fine i'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all and then ultimately they say no you don't have to put it down but uh really it's part of this compliance thing uh the thing i don't like i know that certain states actually sell their uh their lists like uh motor vehicles that really burns me because hey you're required you have to do that and nowhere does it say you ha[ve]- asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone and i think that's it it's one thing voluntarily give it because someone asks you can always refuse but it's another thing where it's required by law and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody you know i don't think i don't think they have the right to do that well that's easy whenever you donate money to someone they you become put on something like a sucker list and you start getting millions of calls or solicitations and then you st[art]- it kind of makes you feel deeded from doing it again like uh National Public Radio or any of these the public uh stations you know i- i- i- i think i sent in in money for once to uh to public uh TV and i started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine i it's like and it just started soon after i had done that once and i just said this is this is terrible um and that's also happened to me where as i've given money to my old Alma Mater in college and uh it's one thing they don't sell the list but the thing that makes me mad is uh then they start getting uh other people to the people do these {phonathons} and they call you up and they actually happen to be people who are graduated in your class or something like that and they say oh we we know you you uh had uh contributed X amount last year can you do better this year and you know like hold on here who how do you know that why why you even telling me this is it any of your business i mean it's one thing that i and the colleges knows that that's just our business there's no need for someone who's soliciting should know it all just uh and that was very offensive too uh-huh right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
you're uh can you tell me what you think of capital punishment um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum was that the rape murder of that sixteen year old girl in a school there was something like something like that on Sixty Minutes about two years ago um-hum hm hm i don't find very many that support mine well actually i mean not not with regard to capital punishment i mean just in general the media um uh they ta[ke]- the the the the the average person in the media is far more liberal than the average person in the rest of the country and so uh views that are more conservative just don't get adequately represented in the mainstream media that's been documented by a number of studies but on capital punishment look that's an exception conservative on that i'm sort of middle of the road i- i lean against capital punishment but i- i wouldn't be an activist on it cause there's so many more important things i think i mean i admit that some innocent people get killed and i believe you're correct that has been documented it happens occasionally and it's very th[at]- th[at]- that's that's quite unfortunate hm well that last caller actually i- i this is the first time i've ever spoken about a topic for the second time but the last caller that i discussed it with didn't didn't say you know even that even the the fraction that would be represented among criminals are convicted more often and in fact i just asked him the question is it is it true that isn't it true that minorities you know from peo[ple]- in general people from lower socioeconomic groups tend to commit more violent crime and so wouldn't you expect them_1 to be to to be convicted more often now i do think i recall seeing some statistics to to the effect that that you that you mentioned um i don't know that you know maybe it was a r[eport]- a news report i heard or something where i couldn't check it out very carefully where i couldn't i i always tend to read over these things you know especially if you have an interest group that comes up with a study that supports their own position if they did the work i always tend to be a little suspicious of it and that might've been the Southern Poverty Law Project or something that did that and so i don't know whether i necessa[rily]- whether i wanna give credence to that without looking into it but i do remember hearing that yeah um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah well i'm i mean i- i- i agree i think that that the problem with capital punishment is that it's irrevocable if you find out you put somebody in jail wrongly you can just let them_1 out if you find out that you you killed somebody wrongly there's nothing you can do to bring them back to life so so that's definitely a problem and um you know well we're supposed to talk about our state i guess according to the synopsis at the beginning so North Carolina has capital punishment well if if North Carolina didn't have capital punishment i wouldn't try and institute it it it does have capital punishment i don't see that it does any good they might convict somebody wrongly sometime that's unfortunate but um you know fa[rther]- the fortunate thing really is th[at]- that it occurs so rarely uh i think we have about uh maybe one execution or a little bit less a year in North Carolina now i i know there're some states like i think Texas is probably the leader in the country i'm not sure of that but i think it may be is that right um-hum hm yeah i think that that you know most southern states tend to have capital punishment more than northern states and a state like Minnesota for example i don't know but i'd be almost sure that they don't have capital punishments Wis[consin]- Wisconsin the same way hm um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay you were helping your parents uh-huh so you're remodeling okay well i i just live in a i live in apartment now i uh two summers ago i went to Massachusetts and i went with a friend of mine and we undertook a building house and this was um a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions and it's preconstructed you might say and we started in um we started from an empty lot with um trees and stuff on it and we had to cut them_1 uh down and clear the lot we had to call in the and have them dig the basement and pour the basement and um went from the ground up our one of our main problems was as well in Massachusetts i thought i was going to well it was a fun time but i thought gosh summer time you know well all it ever did was rain and and one thing is that we're we had we were gonna pour the basement foundation and we're in the process and it started pouring down rain and i guess we had most of it done but the end result what happened was that some of the the wa[ter]- a lot of water settled on the top and it really didn't give a very good finish and some of the it was sort of sandy and and not um a very good finish but it turned it was okay and it's only the basement floor so it was okay but um it kept us pretty busy it was only um there was well me and my friend and then we just had like two helpers and uh sort of a a family type it wasn't you know like a commercial project just something that sort of just you know like get your get his you know my brother brother and well maybe you know my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing and so the the scheduling and everything was sometimes and and then materials coming in and so we're we're hopping around pretty good but overall yeah we got it done and it's a it's a three bedroom two bath house and it's pretty neat yeah so well it was um for my friend's parents they had some property there and they'd lived in this this old it's sort of like a farm you might say and they live in this old house for something like thirty years or something and his mom just wanted a a new house you know that was been her dream and so we did that and uh she was really pleased with it so we came really great so so what why is it that the weather in Atlanta that gets very hot where you live it gets very hot and that's why you're and the the windows have you what type of windows are you putting in because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in um you know the solar game have you what what are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or oh okay okay um-hum okay oh these are so you have the sash windows in d[id]- did uh did it g[o]- go up and down oh i see um-hum yes there's a problem with those those are uh they usually most the time don't open uh-huh um-hum and they also they're they they a lot of vibration and it causes the glass to crack it's a n[ever]- never ending problem -[a]fraid i haven't uh i haven't been in any really home repair things lately i	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

well here in Logan Utah we got a nice little valley here and it's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley yeah yeah definitely here in Utah up along the Wasatch front along the western side of the of these Rocky Mountains here where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo and Logan's up in the valley a little bit further north we get a lot of pollution and it's like seventy percent of it's from cars and uh it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion and when we get get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above and it just sits and sits and sits and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of LA a few years ago it's not it's almost sad because when i grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys and now it's not in the mountain valleys huh they're getting serious about things like uh mandatory well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties emissions yeah they've actually started doing it down along the not in Logan up here because_1 we're doing a lot better we have a lot population's a lot lighter up here yeah yep they're ge[tting]- eliminating that out here they're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun where they're uh looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the basically how much of what is coming out the exhaust kind of like a radar gun and yes yeah do it remotely just looking at the what they do they do several different types of things sometimes they put a source light and they look at the source light and then as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it and you can look at the emissions actually and like across the street they'll set up like a trap or something that add in some sense and they're also looking at uh other you know ways of monitoring this and because_1 they found out something basically that uh and a poorly tuned car can emit something it's an incredible amount it was like four hundred times as much um of certain pollutants and it was like unburned hydrocarbons then a a properly tuned car and and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the the pollution then you know you'd it be one way to cut the pollution in half uh-huh um yeah and they're	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
is crime a problem in Arlington uh-huh well huh huh well uh-huh yeah yeah it it's too bad you mentioned uh your in-laws place as as being like a prison in sense of hard to get into or out of or whatever that's what crime is doing in the cities it's turning those that live in the cities into prisoners it's just uh actually i'm in a suburb of Dallas where it's safer in general than it is in the big city it um i think it's like most cities and that is the high crime areas are the ones where there's more poverty the you know that there's always one part of town uh whether it's the Bronx or whether it's a certain area in Dallas or whatever uh i- i think that's where the crime is concentrated but gosh we just there was just one over in Fort Worth a woman was killed and her husband was uh badly injured and they've charged the uh the husband's daughter with hiring two of her teenage friends to kill her dad and stuff yeah isn't that incredible and i mean uh that that's crime that's that you don't usually think about i mean you if you if you're going to carry on a conversation about crime you know you think of the hardened criminal that keeps uh a[ttacking]- attacking again and again if you will whether you know depending on what his game is maybe it's an armed robber who does it all the time but this is uh oh yeah uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh hum oh ho	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
play oh yeah well i'm into it uh is anybody really oh wow right super yeah that's kind of the way i did it too actually i i played uh just a tiny bit when i was real young and then uh i w[ent]- i got on to a team in high school but wasn't very good still but and then quit for awhile and recently i picked it up like you say about a couple years ago and uh i've been playing you know off and on when i can up in Minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter of course but i actually live in Florida so uh uh i'll be going back down there in May and hopefully be picking it up a little more regularly i was going to say yeah that's that's true all too many times fortunately uh down where i live in Florida there's some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look um one of them is the University of Florida golf course which is open to the public and that's pretty pretty good yeah can you get like a a student discount type of thing or yeah what uh what uh what are greens fees run there okay that's yeah that's about the same i guess as it is in Florida but really oh that's super yeah uh-huh well that's the way to do it though that's the way to get in to some good practice without having the time yeah yeah they need to get a new photography method because once the guy hits the ball and they got to try to follow the ball that's that's a little difficult i mean it they do they do a generally okay job but like you said it's it's kind of boring actually oh yeah yeah i bet that would be great yeah yeah i've never been to a tournament uh you know looking at it on TV y[ou]- you thinking man what a boring thing you know but uh that's that's wild though i'll have to see if i can't get a a chance to go right yeah i can imagine what do you do for a living oh you are which uh which university okay all right great what are you going into okay definitely not golf right yeah if you're good you can really rake in the bucks what was that what was that movie that they had out th[ere]- there was a movie about a professional golfer and i i can't remember it was on network TV a couple times yeah that's right you got to take it easy yeah that's a good thing but uh yeah i guess when i get ba[ck]- i'm going to school in Florida actually um and fortunately i've been able to to play some golf on a student budget which is real helpful you know but it's it's unfortunate you know you hear about Japan i guess you know it's it's like two hundred and fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just to like to practice even insane yeah yeah i guess they have those uh driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of each other they do yeah yeah i- yeah i played uh uh eighteen holes with some Japanese guys in in Gainesville as a matter of fact and it was really wild they were into it you know they kicked our butt all the way to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
-[o]kay yes yeah well i- i i i feel like um i am from Mars i mean i'm fifty years old and uh i've been divorced for um eighteen years but i've two kids and all but i uh i i've never had a budget and i don't uh i don't do any planning and i don't know i don't uh uh i don't have a long-term financial plan and i don't try to control my expenses but i'm i'm glad you're a stranger but really i'm i'm in a happy i i well i'm curious how other people live uh so maybe we should start with you what do you really oh maybe they're going to arrest us both wow uh-huh yeah uh-huh uh-huh huh the um i had a part-time job around oh gosh fifteen years ago seventy six and uh uh this was a sort of a career shift at the time and so i was willing to take a half time job to do that and i actually did my bank account would uh i had i i kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month but i i had miscalculated i well i didn't keep a balance it's one of the problems i never had to in the past i always kept plenty of money in my checking account but when you're only earning half the salary even though i wasn't spending much money i sometimes would just things would get to tight uh and sometimes what i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet and every time i uh i spent money i mean cash mostly i would uh write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent on food so i could do better planning but i would forget to write the things down and i[t]- it that i i don't know if i ever went as far as three months or not i[n]- in keeping that kind of data i certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever yeah uh-huh yeah uh-huh uh-huh the uh i i- i have to say that let's see at this point on i don't run out of money um and it uh a[nd]- and i don't i mean someday if i were to get remarried i might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which i don't have and i i i i think my strategy if if i may i[s]- i[s]- is is to is to not spend money i mean i don't have expensive tastes i don't go out i mean i buy a car well the last car i got rid of i'd had it was nineteen years old pe[ople]- people were embarrassed for me i mean it was it was a good car and oh it was great my my mechanics loved it because it was an old it was a sixty five Buick and it just wouldn't stop um and it i i just didn't feel the need for a new car it isn't like i couldn't afford one uh and now i mean i i don't uh i tend to eat expensive food i mean i don't mind buying a good steak but for me i only do that every week or um without even i mean maybe once a month i mean you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound you buy a a less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars to me i realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that but but i'm just i'm just saying as a single person that's that's a drop in the bucket and so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up if you're buying mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants which i don't care to go to so so that's i think one of the reasons i don't need to budget is that i don't have i don't i don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because_1 i can't afford it because i'm not interested in that expensive thing	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um well you know i- i think i[t]- it really depends you know i think you know i[f]- if you know taking the current batch we've got you like i think Paul Tsongas probably isn't in it for like his own gain i- i don't see him as that kind of a guy i can believe like that Bill Clinton might be um i certainly think a lot of people in Congress are um-hum yeah yeah well you know i th[ink]- i think if you like compare us to other governments you know i- i think we tend to be overly critical of our own government i mean you go and look like a lot of these African countries where corruption is ri[ght]- right out in the open it's like you know you want to do something you know you better even be the president's best friend or you know pay me a lot of money baksheesh or whatever they call it right or bucks make right well you know i- i think you know to some extent you know people get the government they deserve is a cliche but it it's really true i mean if you know you hear these guy i think that this is the first election i've heard about where a lot of the incumbents are really f[inding]- saying okay we're getting out because it's too much heat i mean normally it's yeah okay what big scandal but it comes times to reelect them they say hey this is the guy that brings home the bacon for us you know he's got seniority on all these committees we're not gonna replace him yeah and i mean also you know you look i think a lot of it has to do with ref[orm]- with with with the issue of campaign reform when it costs you i mean ten million twenty million dollars someti[mes]- i've heard horrendous figures to run for a Senate seat you know job pays a hundred thousand a year you know i[t]- i[t]- it the you work it out unless someone is incredibly altruistic you know there's no reason for them to want to run for that right it's an imperfect system because people are imperfect i- i mean the problem is that you know you've got as i said there's no incen[tive]- incentive to go into look at our state legislature and things where very nominal pay but there's also not you know what's the campaign the campaign is four guys go against each other and you know there's no advertising those people i can believe are doing it because they want to change the process but when you're talking about having to spend tens of millions of dollars to get elected and then being in the pockets of all these people who gave you the money and then having to regard how to rep[ay]- you know how to uh kind of do for yourself i think i- i really think that it's not so much that corrupt people go into it as that the process corrupts i- i think it depends a lot on on the state i think that it varies from state to state oh oh man i don't want to talk about the school board we've just we've just been having school board meetings and it was like people suing each over things they said	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i uh try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair actually uh that is really a sore spot with me i i think perhaps the automotive industry is improving but uh like ten years ago um the reliability of automobiles at least US automobiles was pretty dismal and not only that but the uh repair capability of uh service departments and dealerships was equally dismal and uh it seemed that the only way i could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea but uh i pardon well at that time actually i had a Volkswagen Rabbit and um it was i[t]- it was a real lemon uh subsequently i got a uh Buick Century and it wasn't as bad but uh last year i bought a Honda Accord and i take it in once every seventy five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance and that is it and it's wonderful an[d]- hm hm hm so what do you what do you have all the more reason to uh have a a Honda s[o]- so you bought a Pontiac now thi[s]- wha[t]- how old is the car hm hm hm so apparently it was the same one that was on there oh we just uh refi[lled]- re[filled]- uh probably filled the the brake fluid up and that was it so what's the solution to that i guess find a reputable service hm um-hum hm right well that's wonderful you're lucky oh really hm	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay how do you get your news mostly um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum well i can hardly wait for my morning paper to come so that's the first thing i want is the headlines it's really funny because_1 um uh my sister grabs the sports and i grab the headlines but uh and then when five o'clock comes around i just wanna get in the house and turn the TV on to watch the news it's really weird uh i don't stay up late to watch late news because_1 my eyes won't stay up that long but um i love to watch the five o'clock news and i makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time so i can read my paper uh i do have my radio going most of the day though so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too you know but no huh-uh just i just have a channel that has music except for like every hour you know say eight o'clock nine o'clock they come on for just a little bit of the news but as far as the actual news i get that from from the can you hold on just for a second just a minute hello sir yes i'm sorry to keep you waiting um i was calling from work so and that was a call waiting yeah i get um that's true too um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah well you're right there is a lot of it that's that's just garbage as far as i'm concerned you know but i just like the more or less the the daily news you know just uh especially the weather i like that although they're usually wrong uh-huh but uh like i say as far as that's actually listening to the news it's mostly TV five o'clock to six thirty oh that seems like a long time for news but that's how long it is and uh seems like they have the local news and they have the world news and then uh my morning paper i can hardly wait for it to come and um oh yeah right once you get to work i wouldn't either huh-uh but i've always been a morning person to get up you know and but i can't stay up late at night to watch the late news so i guess that's why i watch it at five o'clock but anyhow well listen i guess that's about it then it's been nice talking to you Tony oh really oh well that hasn't happened to me yet so you never know it might this time okay Tony um-hum bye-bye	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
have you had that experience recently oh yeah well i don't have so much trouble with products as service i don't feel like that's as big a problem i've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because i've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly and i'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent um the one i have now is okay most of the time but that's it but that's that's probably the worst my daughter has a charm bracelet i bought her that's guaranteed uh James Avery i don't know if you have that up there but it's it's a very good company that sells sterling silver things and uh she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now and the catch broke and she was sitting in school on a carpet and when she stood up it caught and broke and we took it back and they said oh this was just obviously yanked this was yanked i mean they were so rude about it and so we wanted a different kind of catch and she said well it's not guaranteed and i said well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed so do it anyway so we got the kind we wanted and i was really disappointed with that i felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable and i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends and i called there to see if they had it and the lady was very nice and i said my goodness i said you've been very nice what's your name and she told me and i said well i really appreciate it i said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store and it turned out she was the assistant manager so right so i felt kind of good about that you know i didn't even know the person's name that had me the hard time or anything but i just felt like well at least i did something maybe they'll fix it they might work on that you know but i find attitudes are more of a problem service is more of a problem really that's really great that's really good it used to be like that but i don't think most places are like that anymore	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
actually you know i've been involved in electronics a long time uh in computers and i have have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home uh up until i guess maybe about a year and a half ago i got one for my son a a M[acintosh]- Macintosh uh LC it's a real easy to use color uh computer and i got a very nice printer that goes along with it and he uses it for his school work hm where you going to school i see in engineering so that explains wha[t]- all the uh computer assignments well do you use your PC for things other than explicit computer work no no i just have one for my son and i really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for h[ome]- home computing at wo[rk]- at work uh i'm a technologist uh and i in the past have done a great deal of of uh system development just through uh software development programming uh but now i find myself using the computer even the computer at work is primarily a um word processing system and a communication system yes E-mail is probably pulls down a third of all my time um-hum um-hum hum well i'm a old-timer i did my Master's thesis on uh a typewriter uh i rented an IBM Selectric and it was a pretty big deal yeah it uh well you know it's just it was just a completely different world then i like it yeah i like it from a distance really i- i see the packages on it uh that are available and it's nice i really don't use it myself um i when i come home from work i i like to stay far away from computers and electronic things uh so i let my son do it and uh of course you know there's uh there's an intellectual evolution taking place where i[t's]- i[t's]- it's sort of a joke but it's really true the old-timers even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like VCR's and whatnot and the kids they just take to it like candy	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
okay_1 what would you rather have or you want salary too plus what what's most important to you right um-hum um-hum well i'll tell you i think that is the most important thing i've uh i'm not working right at the moment but the company that i did work for excuse me i had health benefits you know dental vision all that pension plan um now i don't have that although i do have a pension that i'm drawing from them which thank God i had but uh man i think those medical benefits are the most important uh right um i should knock on wood i haven't you know had any serious health problems or anything i've only probably been to the doctor a couple of times since i left work and it was only for a cold you know and they can't really do anything for you anyhow so you might as well not even go y[eah]- yeah right oh you've got a cold go home and take uh liquids and uh rest but um that is definitely the most important um pension i guess is next um thank God that i had one i don't know what happened to the salary employees when uh the company went bankrupt but i was union so mine was being put into a like a trust fund you know so but i don't know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs or yeah that's what i was thinking too i really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that time there you know so where what company do you work for um um-hum no um-hum um-hum um-hum no i i worked for a trucking company P I E nation wide you probably heard of that oh does she really oh how about that well you did well Ryder and P I E went together you know and then then that ended it it really did it's it started i think a little bit before that but that when P I E and and Ryder went together why it was downhill from then on you know right right yes it was over three hundred fifty dollars a month if we wanted to continue our own benefits we could do that for eighteen months but three hundred and fifty dollars a month God that's terrible you know so but anyhow uh and jobs aren't that hard to find to get another one that does pay your benefits you know and a lot of them_1 that if you do get a job they don't pay benefits um-hum um-hum um um-hum um-hum yeah right but you know what's happening is the disability plan you know so many people are lying about their things God there's been big articles in the paper about that uh you know they claim a back injury and then someone goes out and spies on them and they're lifting refrigerators into trucks and and everything else you know so i don't know what's happening and what's going to happen but uh um	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i don't know if you feel the same but uh when it comes to telling kids that they have to do uh two or three years of service into some kind of community i don't know if that's uh appropriate for a government to suggest that and say you know you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen or you know in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do and um i as far as a high school course i could see it as uh maybe a social uh sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program and to me that's fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year but to tell them_1 that they had to do two years there after post high school of community service i'm i'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do um-hum exactly right right um-hum exactly and doing it for a purpose that they want the other thing is this i have thought about this and many times when you get these uh young troubled teenagers that uh don't have like the perspective of uh o[f]- of the community a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems but there are other people out in the community that may have problems then i can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing you have to do so much as far as in a community service now if they were you know the abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse or if uh they destroyed some property around the uh area then they would have to do uh to restore it and perhaps um work um for the community to beautify it or whatever but i could see that working in you know cases where th[e]- it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a whole community that i[s]- is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever and that's i think they have done that and judges have said well you know this is what you're gonna get for um you know a misde[meanor]- misdemeanor or something you may end up having to do some kind of community service so i could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled so um-hum um-hum sure we sure do um-hum yeah yeah yeah um-hum um-hum exactly yeah um-hum and there's a lot of anger sure you know especially if they haven't went through treatment and they dealt with other people in the uh system of prisons which um you you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever i would say the crimes would probably be you know if you went in for a certain crime there might be somebody that ha[s]- has done a crime even worse than what you have so you're dealing with people um that may uh be an influence later on and uh an issue of anger would be is that i went to prison for a year or two but i didn't get any rehabilitation or um you know but then again those that have physically assaulted somebody um that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program out in the community if they're of a violent sort and to say well you have to	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
capital punishment uh i guess out in California has has had a lot of uh a lot of you know discourse in the paper uh apparently uh there's they haven't uh executed anybody since nineteen sixty seven i believe yeah they a well i we were we uh we just started w[e]- we lived in Redwood City when we were out there and uh and we found that uh you know it was a very liberal kind of community but uh i i i really feel that the that the law enforcement community uh you know puts these people behind bars and then they they uh uh you know the lawyers these lawyer groups get together and they uh they i think extend beyond the normal uh appeal process uh you know and just drag these this guy uh his his uh ultimate uh demise out for ten or fifteen years uh and i i think that uh that there there's something that has to be changed in the system to to do that i i think capital punishment uh uh laws are probably stringent enough but i think the appeal process is really getting in the way do do you feel as though there should be uh more uh laws or or more uh you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by uh by uh uh capital punishment um-hum well the term technicality the the the law enforcement community uh uh you know has to has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which uh acts are done to uh to you know get somebody into a a situation where they're gonna be guilty of of a crime or whether uh an[d]- and whether the rights of that individual are been have been you know impugned um but or whether there's just you know a policeman has just made a uh uh you know a a non a non critical e[rror]- error though be it not the right way to do it but but you know the the merits of the case in terms of you know the guy was a law breaker is being supported now i i'm a[t]- a[t]- at this juncture i you know i'm i'm not sure you know what constitutes a a technicality you know that that's what all these these hearings are about and that's what all these you know court cases are about i mean our uh our our glorious uh you know mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of uh out of uh the can and uh you know he he tried to appeal his conviction uh and you know it didn't work but be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry um in in the old days you know and say round about_1 times of Battle of Hastings you know and that vi[llages]- villages if you were a transgressor they they either you know drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody and he were you were his slave and if he didn't like what you did he killed you and that has that's pretty effective uh you know it's not good for civil rights i guess but it's pretty effective in that you know you've got to get along in the community and if you don't you will perish either by the hand of your your your master or by being pushed out in the woods so i- i- i mean as as man has gotten more complicated so all of the uh machinations to uh you know protect him from from being uh dumped on by uh civilian authority in in in some in criminal actions especially you know murder cases and that sort of thing um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh i don't know my personal perception of government and uh the way things are at this current time is that nobody can really be trusted and i don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to uh be self-serving to the community i think that they have their own uh wishes to uh be in the limelight and to kind of say hey you know i'm a public official i don't have to do uh certain things and they just stand out more involving themselves more and more with politics but uh it's really after all the things that i've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts uh of checks uh before that it was the wonderful uh escapade that they had with uh the new uh oh God chief of uh well Supreme Court i'm trying to think of his name and uh what they put uh him through in regards to yeah Thomas the sex the sexual harassment that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers' monies and things like that i- i just think it's very corrupt and whether or not they need to start with people that are extremely poor and send them into government versus people that are rich but it's always the rich person that gets into government that has uh the money to advertise the money to d[o]- to do this there's no more Abe Abraham Lincolns out there uh that can get into government even if they were poor so i know that's my personal viewpoint of things now they just uh they've already put through the health bill yes it just went through and it was passed and that is going to be a heavier tax burden on a lot of the taxpay[ers]- taxpayers and a little bit more on to the medical uh i don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people you know what i'm saying it it's right now every little state around here is thinking about oh we need to reform the health uh system and of course they think uh Wisconsin our neigh[bor]- or Minnesota our neighbor passed a state law the health bill and it's kind of like we're the first to do it so i don't know if it's done because we're we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for uh you know a real good purpose to help people that can't afford uh health insurance that kind of thing uh-huh oh sure oh sure uh-huh it it sure does and i think it it is reflecting like you said i think society as a whole uh you can't expect uh when we have TVs and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for uh you know immorality and this and this and this that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be clean totally clean and come into government uh but down the line it does hurt i mean when somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something it's uh you know it does hurt the each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or you know the other things that have occurred so uh uh-huh exactly yeah well that's exactly what happens in government all the time hey blow the whistle on each other oh i hear that you're doing this i've done it but oh boy and it's not going to get out ex[actly]- yeah e[xactly]- exactly it's uh there's no secrets in the government uh i don't think anymore uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh sure uh-huh uh-huh oh sure i think i- i don't think uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

okay uh okay so our subject is nursing homes um do you have any experience or any uh opinions on what to do i do um-hum that's wonderful um-hum um-hum um-hum that's great because uh you know i think that is probably a persons greatest fear and i'm not faced with this yet but my mother is seventy three she's in good health and living by herself but um i'll probably be faced with this you know sometime in the next few years as to what to do when mom gets to the point that she can't take care of herself um unfortunately having her come live with us you know if she needs constant care is not going to be an option and what do you do you know um-hum um-hum and we don't have the nuclear family that we used to have many many years ago either well it's good that you know that you have that option available um th[at]- because i don't think that too many communities have something like that set up um-hum probably not um and it might even be easier here in that there are so many more churches available more people to draw from well yes that's for certain my my mom lives in a small town also and i know you know the funds just aren't available uh to do something in a small town that you have that you can do in a larger town but um uh you know other than care conditions you know i don't know really what else a person looks for uh convenience for the family would be a a wonderful thing uh but th[at's]- that's you know that's not always an option either um-hum um-hum is that um-hum well and i think that would be a good idea too i don't know if these people need it for self-esteem it would seem to me that they would but if nothing else yes let them earn some of their money um-hum um-hum that's right that's right i well i guess that's probably as people get older f[or]-	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh-huh uh yeah i do have a car uh right now i have sort of a sporty car it's a Subaru that i[s]- it's called an XT6 i don't think they make them anymore i think i have the last year and it's one of these Japanese cars that run without needing many repairs um my advice about cars is uh get a good engine get something that goes not because i'm a speed freak uh something because if you want to get on a highway you don't want to step on the gas and and say come on come i do you know they make jokes about women picking out the color but i really do like to have a decent in my car and i have a six cylinder and it does go when i tell it to and and i just like the looks of a kind of sporty car uh i think my car needs are going to change i had very small children and i was saddled with a station wagon that i never wanted um i was told that you know it'll hold groceries and all this stuff well the grocery bags fell over in a station wagon you know a[nd]- and you know and i wasn't that thrilled to put a bike in it or a dog in it and i didn't so when i got a new car i got a sporty little car and my kids were still small enough but they weren't in baby seats anymore and they sat in the back and now my son is fourteen and a half and he's taller than i am and every time i go over a bump he crashes his head because you know these cars have they're backseats but they're kind of toy so i think should i get another car uh much to my chagrin it'll have to be something more boxy and you know practical again so this i g[uess]- i guess this is my reprieve and i guess my suggestion to you is to get something you really enjoy because at some later date you'll have to get something more uh-huh well you know the more i think of it you know with what's going on in the world nowadays i think the next car i would try to buy an American one yeah i think so it's you know Toyotas and all those they['re]- they're nice cars but you know surely there's an American car i i'd love to check out the Saturn which is supposed to be a new newly made American car oh yeah i have is it really huh really how was the pricing oh that's that's not horrible at all that's quite good nowadays yeah parts are made in different places right i wonder who makes the the Geos becau[se]- is it because_1 they're so cute the Geo Storm is adorable no no i don't in fact i i sat in one a long time ago and slammed the car door and it felt a little tinny you know it wa[s]- it's a smaller lighter car but you know that was years ago that was about four years ago when i bought mine so it may have changed i know on looks i think the Storm is just adorable little car for a single person hm are are you working yet uh-huh yeah because_1 i was wondering if you're are you going to finance it right uh well i have been fortunate enough to be able to just pay for it and i i like to do that but there are people who can pay for it who prefer to finance it yeah i[t]- it seems to me as you're paying interest you're bound to be end up paying more i guess now you have to think about uh if the money in the bank will get more interest uh then then you'll want to finance it but if now the banks are giving so little interest i imagine you might as well just pay for it if you could	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
okay_1 um let me see i've been sitting here awhile i almost forgot the topic but uh it seems like i get most of my news from television i'm we only get the paper on the weekends and so i'm not much of a of a paper reader or but i i and i'm don't rarely listen to the um radio so it i get most of my news like from documentaries like Forty Eight Hours Twenty Twenty you know i[t]- the news at night new[s]- news in the afternoon and that kind of thing uh-huh uh-huh right huh um are you in the car quite a bit or oh oh uh-huh oh i see um yeah i i i pretty much am and i watch the news at least twice a day so uh if i've missed something and an[d]- and i've just recently decided to home with my children and so seems as if i catch the news right as it ha[ppens]- happens you know there was uh the explosions and that kind of thing my husband will say how'd you know about that and i said yes it happened at such and such time and that's so that that's different for me so i usually find out wh[en]- exactly when it happens and that kind of thing uh no it just seems like since i've recently stayed home th[at]- that is what's happened you know it's just that uh i now that i've stayed home i'm i'm usually aware of wh[en]- when these things have occurred and it happened and right right uh-huh um-hum hum right right it kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story that kind of thing so um yeah yeah uh-huh yeah i know what you're saying yeah but i try and catch most of those programs on Wednesdays and Fridays and if i miss them_1 i you know i try and and uh tape them if i'm out or that kind of thing i try and tape them and so i can sit back and watch it and it's pretty interesting um um-hum y[eah]- well yeah plus i find i have to video tape quite a bit of if i don't want any interruptions yeah that kind of thing um it seems like ten o'clock at night unfortunately but that's that's what it seems like ten o'clock at night uh-huh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
i guess i guess by what you said you're you you don't feel you're uh privacy has been inva[ded]- invaded anytime recently um-hum right uh nah i wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means uh you know i would there there's a lot of times though uh you get those calls and you know when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or or whatnot and you know next thing you know uh someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to y[ou]- to tell them_1 you know that you're not interested or you do tell them_1 you're not interested and they still keep asking you you know and a[nd]- keep badgering you about it and that aggravates me but i don't know that you could call that invading of m[y]- invading my privacy because you know if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look you know i want my name unlisted or i want my you know it doesn't um-hum oh uh-huh um-hum hm well let me ask you about this here's something that uh -[ha]s been kind of concerning me lately my fiance received a bill from a a Lord and Taylor company uh y[ou]- you know they're a they're a department store she received a bill from them uh that she had visited so[me]- some store and and i think it was there in Florida maybe it was in Miami uh that she had visited a store there and uh they had this bill uh that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise uh over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise uh and the date that that she supposedly made this purchase she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving um and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number um and and i've i've heard recently that uh uh that this is a common occurrence where people are using s[omeone's]- you know they they use Joe Blow's so[cial]- uh social security number uh and can uh potentially ruin someone's credit huh um-hum yeah yeah well y[ou]- yeah yeah well we got it cleared up eventually what happened uh	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
um basically what do you do to get your news um-hum um-hum depending on how long it takes you to get to work oh okay um-hum um-hum um-hum well do you find that they uh tend to after a certain period of time broadcast the same thing over and over um-hum um-hum um-hum and so you threw the magazines away and wasted your money and well basically i get i listen to ABC in the morning uh on th[e]- the Good Morning America an[d]- while i'm getting ready for work and other than that occasionally um i'll catch some news when i come home my husband's a big news fan and he'll always have the news on but sometimes i'll get involved doing some other things and um newspapers maybe on the weekend but during the week i just really don't have the time in the morning to get it uh and i'll listen to news on the radio but just in the car radio going to and from work in between music um-hum that's another channel well this is true they wanna put a little humor in there um-hum	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
well i think AIDS research should be funded more than it's currently being funded i think that uh people including i mean mostly the government but also you know a lot of Americans i think that it's a disease of of a certain population i meaning um homosexuals and and uh intravenous drug users in fact it is very much a a normal person's uh disease as well i think that we should fund much more um-hum yeah um-hum yeah the monkey i think yeah yeah well you know you have you have a point about you know where there's other issues that that need a lot of funding too uh sure that is true but uh there's a lot of things that are funded and a lot of waste that can be redirected too i think that that again that uh you know AIDS is is something that has to be dealt with by every person um and and not just in understanding that it's you know can affect uh everyone but in acting um in a uh you know sensible way to avoid uh the spread of this disease um-hum um sure right right um-hum right right yeah good point um i- i think more often should go into you know AIDS uh education you know co[mmercials]- you know public service commercials um schools things like that yeah which is ridiculous it's like coming up with plague you know no it's not happening uh disregard the you know one out of two people dropping dead next to you you know right right um-hum right peop[le]- i hear a lot more in local news about it yeah interesting uh-huh right yeah yeah i guess so um-hum um-hum right	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
well i haven't had an awful lot of uh incidents in regarding child care when my two year old was in New Orleans she got bit on the cheek and uh but uh that's about the the uh the extent of it but but but th[e]- when i really am uh am concerned about is that uh so many of these child care places are are coming under uh uh you know investigation for for uh you know child molestation and i and i and i'm saying to myself well you know y[ou]- you dump your your your little turnip off to uh you know this child care place and they don't pay very much and wh[y]- why why would they be interested in y[our]- in your little turnip unless you know one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest you know and uh that's a terrible kind of thing and i- i don't think my children have ever been subject to that but my wife didn't work and so we di[dn't]- really didn't have that much exposure to it hm hm oh well that's interesting oh my Go[d]- well you must have a just one hero ace professional job to support something like that oh well yeah um-hum well no[t]- not all of us you know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for i'm an engineer and uh-huh yeah five hundred dollars a week for two kids that's incredible well w[ell]- yeah you know they could uh somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare and you know and that's a good starting wage but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care i mean we used to pay pay fifty cents an hour to babysit but mi[ne]- mine are twenty two twenty three and twenty seven so you know that i guess babysitters now are up at what five dollars an hour oh my um-hum oh yeah	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
uh with regard to uh to jury trials i you know i- i really feel as though uh jury trials are are uh whatever system has been been used historically in particular jurisdiction you know is really the the only kinds of things that you can use because the the jurisprudence is you know based on on uh you know on accumulated body of law and if if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they they start they could start going back and digging up all these cases that uh that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards so i- i really don't think it th[ey]- they can really do much of anything to change it what do you think well won't well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that but then then you know the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently and you know the other two guys sat in the car and they didn't get beat up you know Rodney got beat up because he he you know he pur[poses]- you know he involved himself in some sub self-destructive behavior and uh um just like the burning and looting is self-destruct everybody says well this is the nineties and they're gonna rebuild and it'll be even better hey what do you think you know some some black guy with capital is gonna come in and invest in that area with everybody with that mindset they they're they're gonna that whole area is gonna be turned into residential ghetto you know and a[nd]- you might even be able to to use it for for a bombing test site you know well e[verybody's]- everybody's saying this is gonna be a new era we're gonna reexamine this thing hey the bu[nch]- the average person is gonna take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed they're a bunch of animals you know how can you really deal with an environment where you're gonna lose everything forty deaths i mean there are forty people that are dead as a result of that and i'm just trying to determine you know how you address and how you weigh you know Rodney getting getting the the hell beat out of him against you know forty deaths yeah and there's no other i i'm not su[re]- exactly sure uh what the circumstances surrounding the deaths and i'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and and pursued it you know because i'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing is it a looter that got shot by a store owner i you know no tears yeah and and so i but i i suspect a number of them_1 you know you you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot you know in in the street and and my reaction is i would've run over fifty people before rather than stop and uh and th[ere]- there would've been just uh nothing but carnage after after if i'd been at the wheel no one would've stopped me right i'm inside the beltway you know how capital gang they always say well inside the beltway they think thus and so and i say well wait a minute i'm inside the beltway and i don't think like that i'm a government employee i'm with the FBI yes an[d]- and so um uh and and the reason i'm doing this whole thing is because you know Rick who is another government employee wanted a spee[ch]- segments of my speech that uh were done a year ago and he wanted another collection a year later and so this is my seventh call a year ago i did eleven calls and so that's that's why uh uh tha[t's]- that's why i'm religiously getting on the phone because i have a unique you know i have a unique situation here in that if i don't participate	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
