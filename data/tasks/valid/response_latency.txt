user:i think they just could have handled it more professionally i- i- i believe that they they hurt themselves i guess|agent:um-hum|user:i think they hurt the sport this year with all that controversy over that locker room incident with uh with uh all that the reporter and stuff and	oh yeah	2

user:um-hum|agent:uh it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive and then i then it will happen again|user:i think it could happen yeah	because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things	0

user:getting paroled lets say in so many years i mean if your going to sentence somebody|user:yes yes not|agent:and that that the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced	yes	2

user:no i didn't but i- i did read the book i ha[ve]- do have i have six years of college|agent:i think the the significant thing is is today did did you uh did you see Barbara Walters interview with Schwartzkopf|user:anything at that time in my life very much in great detail	well they	2
user:do you see what i mean and then the same in Vietnam you would you wouldn't handle Vietnam the same way you would handle uh Saddam Hussein|user:and just say i bind you in Jesus name your [vocalized-noise] i just and rebuke any enemy because i believe it's a spiritual war that's going on and it's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home illegally that's not normal there's something going on there and that i would have discernment by the Holy Spirit to be able to pray over that|user:and i know people that have done that i mean i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes	yeah	2
user:[vocalized-noise]|agent:yeah|user:in the classroom	how wha[t]- do what do you mean by that	1

user:i think that Sixty Minutes bought some guns and um|user:and they wouldn't have to do the background check and i mean they went on to tell about all the the illegal guns and everything and that|agent:yeah	um-hum	2
agent:but uh when he's out on police work you know he leaves her home alone and shows them where they are in case she needs [laughter-them] and i worry about that|agent:responsible relative to guns|agent:and uh uh you know i think that's good because she's not afraid of them_1 and it it teaches her to be	i would almost worry about that more than if she didn't have one	2
agent:wow|user:they want pretty close to three thousand dollars just to replace that|agent:[noise] um yeah	so what do you do	1

user:they're they're relatively small uh we've been lucky in the past we didn't have that problem but right now we don't for the other things the things that do crop up that we aren't really expecting we have different funds set aside for different things like we have a car fund and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not|user:uh have to worry about because of insurance and|user:most of our medical things we don't	oh	0

user:but you're you're finally getting to the point where it's just kind of second nature to find some place to to throw it|user:because in the past you know it seemed like i can remember people just just throw it down they don't care|agent:uh-huh	um-hum um-hum	0

user:and i think that's part of the problem why people don't vote anymore because of of it's just out of people's hands and they say one vote means a lot but|agent:i think a lot of people were disappointed because they had been held hostage for so long|user:yeah so there was some collusion in there i guess	but is a lot enough people	0
user:uh more than one at a time because i think you could run forever paying what they require|user:the other thing i i think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off|user:you know if i'm short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can	oh yeah	0
user:even before it probably wasn't though because you didn't get anywhere near as much as what it|agent:right you cannot write off your interest|agent:you cannot	yeah	0

agent:uh|agent:the|user:yeah well right now the situation is so tight at many places that it's even hard to have a choice	uh	0
user:okay|user:[noise]	okay	0
user:he's been going down hill you know|user:or what but the last say three years since he had to have some kind of brain surgery|user:is failing bad you know i don't know if he has starting of Alzheimer or	uh-huh	0
user:oh a ski boat though|agent:i'm not i'm not sure what kind it was i saw it just sitting on the side of the road|user:what kind	ye[ah]- oh yeah	0
user:well i think i could for awhile i do not know but yeah|agent:i think i could probably handle that|user:[laughter]	for awhile	2
user:so anyway|agent:huh|user:yeah that was really neat i had never seen the shad do that so that was pretty cool	that's kind of different	0
user:it's really nice having it in the garage because_1 then if we want to go to Whitney or you know Grapevine or any other place it's just there and we can load up and go|agent:oh i know it|user:and but it's really nice i mean we've talked about getting the the slip so that if after work if i wanted to go out and play around in the boat i would have plenty of time because_1 now it does not get dark until nine o'clock but	yeah that's true	1
user:[laughter] well hopefully someday you will get that dream boat an[d]-|agent:right [laughter]|agent:[laughter]	oh i know it or that time off one of the two	0
user:um i would want them to make that decision and i would you know|agent:would you i mean if you had children would you want them to go to a certain place or|agent:uh	yeah	0
user:and then another reason was i was not sure you know i always wanted to go to school for nursing and then at the last minute i changed my mind|user:uh|agent:yeah	uh-huh	0
agent:right|user:uh they pretty much got to the point well well you know you are at that age and you are going to have to decide what you want to do if you goof up it's your fault it's not ours you know|agent:uh-huh	right	1
agent:uh-huh|user:so i switched to finance and i liked it better [noise] and i pulled myself from a two oh to a two five you know in my last year my senior year|agent:yeah	yeah	2
user:uh the lesser of the two|agent:uh-huh|user:in the world as uh	oh always	0
user:futuristically|user:what i would like to see happen|user:and i	uh-huh	0
user:uh and i think that can happen in a very won[derful]- wonderful way|agent:hm|user:there's a conflict	huh	0
user:uh and take what they're interested in and then then start looking for schools|user:right now i feel the main thing is to look at what they're interested in|user:i think the main thing is to uh	do you think that what they say that they are interested [vocalized-noise] in is [vocalized-noise] eighteen is going to be what they are	1
user:it's quite a bit different|agent:an upper class suburb of Dallas let me tell you|user:right	it's very different	0
user:have any award to the victim it just puts off their collecting it|agent:the [vocalized-noise]|user:right well they can't get any if the judge is going to	yeah that too	0
user:hello	hello	2
user:but i [noise] really don't read that many i never do buy them you know like when i'm at the grocery store magazines much|user:and that's what i read when i eat my lunch|user:when i'm eating lunch i like to read one or the other you know comes in the mail once a week and	do	2
agent:college age and stuff|user:yeah|agent:uh projected cost was going to be by the time like you know mine reached	and it's going to be pretty darn expensive and	0
agent:coming up on fifteen years and it|agent:uh|agent:TI now uh	and it just uh this year is going to go to four weeks here so	0
user:story line about people trying to find themselves there were parts that were sad i mean it just ran the gamut of emotion|user:at the same time it had a|user:a really funny movie	uh-huh uh-huh and	0
agent:yeah yeah|user:the oldest is nine the youngest is three he doesn't really pay attention and the five year old doesn't have the attention span either but the|user:the uh	uh-huh uh-huh	0
agent:yeah|user:at least i don't think so [noise]|agent:uh-huh	well ye[ah]- i don't think too many of them_1 are anymore it's it's a shame but uh yeah	0
agent:uh|agent:uh-huh|user:uh-huh well my husband's my husband got to chose choose the make [laughter] and then i got everything else [laughter]	[laughter]	0
user:uh-huh|agent:i guess they call it a midsize car but|user:oh really	[laughter]	0
user:a neat thing to have but i- i for some reason they don't carry them and i don't know if they found they were unsafe or|agent:looks like a real good idea to me|user:while back i saw them advertise that and i thought that might be kind of a neat	hum	0
user:oh it is up here too it is everywhere but|agent:i guess if you went uh|user:well i- i didn't course	if you went over by the	0
user:so i thought well that i don't know we even debated about that at that time but decided no that wasn't the [laughter]|user:for a real good buy and they had supposedly in Houston they had a lot of them_1|agent:oh yeah oh i guess that's true yeah	[laughter]	0
agent:yeah|user:well that's really weird because_1 last winter i bought my first cardigan that i ever remember buying and i only got to wear it like twice all winter long so|user:[laughter]	are you from here then	0
user:but it's just kind of frustrating because_1 on the weekends you want to go out to play and you don't have any play clothes|agent:yeah|user:yeah	[laughter-um-hum]	0
user:on sale|user:wow|user:uh-huh	on that much of a sale	0
agent:you know and i think most of that is because their parents aren't around|user:uh-huh|agent:the only crime we really see is uh just the kids being malicious	that make sense	0
user:in the society|user:but on the other side of it is it's it's basically the the problem is within the|agent:[laughter-yeah] [laughter-yeah]	uh-huh	0
user:uh y[ou]- well the other side is that unfortunately|agent:what happens if we lose worse|user:but the other side of it to me	yeah	2
user:and you know there's a million dollars you can have|user:somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody|user:uh i work with lawyers a lot and i see unfortunately we have this whole mentality that	uh-huh	2
agent:that organization it was easy to tell that just from the rehearsal time|agent:and uh he ended up with some very unusual characters in that|agent:no matter how they were performing at that particular season	but uh anyway what were you going to tell me about your dad	0
agent:anyway|agent:but uh|agent:most of it is still in boxes stacked quite high in a back room	um	0
user:uh brought you know if it's first degree rape second deg[ree]- degree rape or whatever|user:that are actually|user:only decide the charges	right	2
agent:[noise] i don't know if we could get away with guns completely|user:yeah|agent:that's right nobody over there carries guns	i guess	0
user:you know there has to be a happy medium and uh i know the the uh|user:some[where]- somewhere along the line then uh|agent:not in this country	right	2
user:i've just gotten a another job at an elementary library at Barron|agent:oh|user:but oh and and i haven't told you i'm going to be at a different school this year now	well i bet you're you're you may dress differently then for that	0
user:right right right|agent:but they're just sort of into clothes and then there's other departments that aren't|agent:and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools like history at Clark they're all pretty fancy	and they'll just wear your common ordinary you know whatever you might [laughter]	0
user:you don't think so|agent:i don't think we'll ever get to that|user:follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top and	uh no i don't think i think we're going the opposite direction it's the parochial schools that i guess many ti[mes]- they've had uniforms for years i r[eally]- don't really know if they still do	0
agent:[laughter]|user:and so we end up usually finding something that's uh quick service and uh that's hopefully economical and uh certainly tastes good i hate to uh pay any kind of an amount and then have the food be real mediocre|agent:uh-huh	uh-huh	0
user:yeah|agent:so that was that was a couple things that we liked|agent:and uh and that's another thing that would bring me back to a restaurant is the view and the one in in Monterey was really nice because_1 it was overlooking the water too	but	0
user:uh-huh|agent:so uh course now we're we're already telling our son you know Tex[as]- uh Oklahoma's good and Arkansas is good|user:yes that that's true it makes a lot of difference and uh	now of course Texas is good only because you know	0
user:um-hum|agent:better than many other systems like having a judge decide [laughter]|agent:um i think it works	i can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide although it's difficult because they all have to be new unanimous	0
user:yeah|user:um-hum|agent:no whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty uh unique i think when they started it	so [laughter] how long do we [laughter-need] [laughter-to] [laughter-talk] [laughter] do you know	0
agent:the i noticed going to work the other day there's a warehouse or paper company and they buy like|agent:but uh|user:uh-huh	your office paper that you've used	0
user:right|agent:yeah but i mean i guess there's only so much they can do as far as re[cycle]- as advanced stuff now but something else that i'd really like to get into more and i haven't is the like the Downy softener products and stuff that you just buy the concentrate|user:well we just need to do more and more [laughter]	i wish they'd get more into that	0
user:what about you|user:um|user:um also U of M seemed overwhelming in size and	well i went to the University of Minnesota	0
user:biology and i also wanted to spend|user:i did pick it because at the time i was interested in majoring in|user:um or small group situations and	um-hum	2
user:yes he thinks that's what he'd like to do but he's really strong in math and science too and|agent:what what does he hopes to be a writer|user:test um	huh	2
user:for those that are|user:well apparently there must be work available|agent:you know even in the same state	yeah there is in that area	0
user:and uh it's too far to you know really go too often|user:to drive home|user:no but like Connecticut takes eight hours	uh-huh	1
user:well i've i've had uh i had three Cocker Spaniels|agent:[laughter] No [laughter] that's for sure and uh that's actually all the pets we have at this time|user:in other words it never multiplies [laughter] [laughter-okay]	how about you	2
agent:yeah|user:so i don't have to worry about going out there and like for example i'm going on this two week vacation he'll be fine|agent:um-hum	ooh how nice	0
agent:and we look out at a creek and a park|agent:and we don't want a fenced in backyard we're on a corner|agent:talking recently about having a dog but we don't have a a fenced in backyard	and we just you know one reason we	0
agent:had to do it again|agent:and ha[d]-|user:because_1 yes dogs need training but cats usually don't even need any training	yeah	0
user:okay|agent:that there's that much glory in the Plano schools versus say Richardson and some of the other areas|agent:it's that	uh	2
agent:uh|user:okay|agent:but i do think they do provide some type of special interest focus i think the later years	for for students	0
user:oh that's right that's right i can remember it not it's really August that it happens you get those great big cracks in the ground where it's been so dry and it just gets so dry and|agent:humidity or or uh rainy time when it's past June|user:yes	right	2
user:probably out that direction but that's the only one i probably could name|user:i think it's toward Ann Arbor so it's|user:well i think it's	uh-huh	0
user:yeah i got a lot of northern neighbors here|agent:oh you could|user:well you know i i could uh pick the uh Chicago team	okay	0
agent:right|user:on uh six thirty five and Coit right in that area|user:they used to practice you know right over here uh	well over there at uh near Forrest i think and	0
user:yeah uh-huh|agent:right that's right i think i went to more of their games when they were still operating out of uh the Cotton Bowl|user:or if they had it at all you know	than i have since they moved to Texas Stadium	0
user:Jones yeah|agent:Jones|agent:oh the uh	yeah Jones is his name	1
agent:yeah|user:oh it's good fishing up there|agent:but i've never actually fished there	so you like to go for striper then	0
agent:uh but i had a string of seven or eight years in a row|user:oh|agent:and so i i've been spoiled by that	of uh sort of a close knit group we would just hop in the car and drive straight through	0
user:and it was so funny because i mean they'd just be hanging over the side of the boat mom i think i got a fish i think i got a fish|agent:right|user:those kids they've got real fishing poles but they're the little short ones	that's incredible	0
agent:huh|user:and they'll go down there while i'm cooking dinner and just start reeling those little babies in and they have more fun with that|agent:right	what do they use for bait	0
user:are are you pretty involved with with their uh|agent:that's true|user:[vocalized-noise] seems [vocalized-noise] naturally you know just they start so young just kicking the ball and	i try to be as much as i can	2
user:tenth grade i guess my oldest was and i had one in tenth and one in ninth and one in eighth and then this third grader|user:six years older than he is so she must have been in about uh|user:oh she's about	right	2
user:the whole story or even when they do know the whole story|user:to come riding to the rescue and take their child's side without knowing|user:their idea of parenting is	right	2
user:uh Christ United Methodist|agent:okay what choir are you from|user:[noise] Leslie French	well of course i'm the little short one that sits on the end by Judy Dillon	0
user:and then you just use it for dipping your chip into [noise] and|agent:okay you|agent:okay	that's a wonderful recipe	0
agent:so i'll be faced with having to return that product and uh and hoping that uh you know that they will accept it|user:oh|agent:uh at least hooked in the new part only to discover that that apparently is not the problem it's not in the switch because it does the same thing with the new switch	although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used	1
user:in the uh computer control unit which fortunately they replaced under warranty because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part|agent:huh|user:and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error	my goodness	1
user:no|agent:yeah yeah yeah and that's and that's really not necessary it really isn't if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference it would make a huge impact so i'm excited about the recycling program in Plano i i can't wait for them to get it started|agent:yeah	um because th[at]- it'll be that much easier for us you know like i said now we have to take it over to to Wal-Mart it would be real nice if they just came by and just picked it up	0
user:[noise] um|agent:so often i think though elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad i work with a lot of elderly people i'm a trust officer|user:and uh she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore so	and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals	0
user:um|agent:and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on|user:um-hum	so it's difficult it really is and we're all heading that way and	0
user:uh learning to play the piano|user:well i uh uh my children are|agent:oh what do you do	oh wonderful	0
agent:we all enjoy music too|user:uh|agent:yeah [laughter] but uh	um i don't know if they want us to specifically to do more on the craft side or	1
user:they do still have opportunities|agent:um-hum|user:but i do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um	yeah that's probably true	0
user:sometimes what Richardson and Plano both i mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much|user:and i do think um the schools do try and do something even with food drives and um|user:yeah	uh-huh	0
user:working high school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades|user:well just recently in the paper here were articles about students um|user:right	um-hum	2
agent:it is|agent:but|user:right	frightening	0
user:oh yes i'm an old experienced hand i started back when it wasn't stylish to do that at all my daughter that's seventeen now|agent:okay do you have you ever had to put your children in in child care Mary Dell|user:[noise]	uh-huh	0
agent:yeah|agent:uh-huh|user:and she kept Cheryl during the day and then did [vocalized-noise] more babysitting at night and she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead	oh	0
user:Employee Assistance Programs that|agent:uh-huh|user:you retain employees and keep them longer that's that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our	uh-huh	2
user:oh i think i know what they|agent:uh|agent:there a i don't know what kind of flowers they are they're real common around here they're they're orange and they look like a lily sort of	yeah	0
user:a[nd]- and they're big and [vocalized-noise] they're real full and everything you know in the summer time but it it's killing everything underneath|agent:um-hum|user:i know we can't either but i've got pre[tty]- two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard uh you know one on either side of the yard	yeah	0
user:pretty soon though by next year he should be able to do it all by himself|agent:uh-huh|user:yeah well mine's getting there he helps he does half and i do half so	yeah	0
user:possible but|user:if that's|agent:oh	um-hum	0
user:to give it a try with them|user:and so we finally found someone else that was willing to to|agent:oh	uh-huh	1
user:um-hum|agent:yeah yeah well we warned them y[ou]- the kids you know we said you know with the cat in the house|user:to get that cage down and into it somehow	you know these may [laughter-not] [laughter-last] [laughter-too] [laughter-long]	0
user:dinner|agent:ooh that's sound good i love that|user:so and asparagus and that's our favorite	my husband really likes seafood	1
user:and|agent:uh-huh sure|agent:[laughter] yeah	sometimes those are the best ones	0
agent:yeah|user:and stuff anyway mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway|user:they get enough sugar	yes [laughter]	0
agent:gang|agent:rebellion and things because of that and the things like the|agent:and uh i think we're seeing a lot of	gang things that are happening and and um	2
agent:it's okay i don't know i- i- i told my kids basically|agent:and uh|agent:a year and a half	i would just not as i just soon not have a pet in the house but	0
user:they've always been a part of my life|user:i remember my first camera experience as trying to put cats up on a porch and take pictures of them_1 that were going to be award winning type [laughter] photos|user:we never back then you didn't spay and neuter your animals that much you just kind of put up with whatever happened and she could never get rid of them_1 fast enough before the next litter came along it wasn't usual unusual for us to have six and seven cats and	well i guess so you've had them_1 so you had them_1 just from early on then	0
user:[laughter-no] i guess not [laughter] it's not pet related|agent:uh we can't talk about that can we [laughter] we went to Gulf [laughter] Gul[f]-|user:where'd y'all go	Gulf Shores Alabama	0
user:fajitas now|user:uh you know the standard tacos enchiladas tamales and|user:so when we go out i'm always looking for something other than the standard menu even if it's a Mexican restaurant like something other than	you're brave [laughter]	0
user:oh absolutely|agent:gosh it's nice it's nice to have somebody come and [noise] wait the table|user:uh-huh	and clear the table and	0
agent:you know sort of a bad area but he was just out riding his big wheel and a couple of|user:uh-huh|user:but	drug people got into a fight with a gun and he got hit and killed by a stray bullet	0
user:to cover more area and i don't know if if gangs occur much down in Texas do they|user:spreading you know like everybody thinks of them only in LA and New York but they spread out|user:and they they talk about too the gangs	yeah i think they have them in Dallas because i hear them talking about in the schools different things happening and they've had some drive-by shootings outside of the schools	0
user:yeah that's the other one that we went to see that night|user:so hard|agent:uh well i want to see that and City Slickers both i love comedies but that's what i was [laughter]	oh was it [laughter]	0
user:but and i've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it|user:and uh he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks you've only got two more weeks i said okay fine i i will i [laughter-will] whatever you call easy i'll do it you know|agent:[laughter]	yeah yeah	0
user:it's wonderful the only thing is you have to wait you have you have to expect to wait at least an hour|agent:no um but i've heard that's really good too and|user:a casual evening is Houston's have you been there	oh	0
agent:one place and i've only been there for lunch but um i went with a friend and we met her husband um down|agent:i haven't either uh|user:and uh i've i've not been there	on Greenville down near the Highway Twelve area is Gershwin's	1
user:well it|agent:yes|user:how to pick one right	and you've been through three of those	0
user:uh Brian and John's in high school so she was somewhat limited in her in her choices to places like Stephen F and|user:i think that was somewhat of a a default because her grades were not as good as|user:really didn't have a major when she went in in fact	uh-huh	2

agent:definitely agree on that|agent:i- i|user:health benefits things like uh insurance for number one but another would be like um [noise] facilities or the ease some easy way to go out and exercise or something like that if you felt like it in the middle the day	um i'm working for a law firm right now the benefits are not bad the only thing i think that they're desperately missing is we have no dental plan whatsoever	0
