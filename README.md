## Files
All data files are under FTAD-sw.zip

* `utterrances` contains the strutural annotation of dialogue transcription  
    * `utter.txt`: corpus of dialogue, with each line as an IPU, column separated by tab
    * `decision.txt`: the list of turn-taking decision points and corresponding actions of each dialogue, column separated by tab

* `tasks` contains the turn-taking prediction task data constructed from utterrances
    * `eot.txt`: end of turn prediction
    * `break.txt`: response prediction at opponent's interruption
    * `backchannel.txt`: sequenctial prediction task for backchannel
    * `response_latency.txt`: expected response time prediction


## Data format
### Schema for `utter.txt`
* `session_id`: session id from Switchboard
* `type`: from one speakerâ€™s perspective, 'user' stand for the opponent and 'agent' stand for himself.   
* `id`: utterance sequential id for each speaker, starting from 0
* `begin_time`: begin time (in milliseconds) of current utterance
* `end_time`: end time (in milliseconds) of current utterance
* `begin_decision_id`: corresponding decision point id at utterance begin, -1 means no DP can be associated to this utterance. **Only available for agent utterrances.**
* `end_decision_id`: corresponding decision point id at utterance end, -1 means no DP can be associated to this utterance. **Only available for agent utterrances.**
* `text`: the utterrance text 
* `ext_msg`: some additional annotations generated by pipeline, like shrink tag etc.

### Schema for `decision.txt`
* `session_id`: session id from Switchboard
* `id`: id of decision point
* `time`: timestamp for the decision point
* `state`: duplex state of the dialogue at the moment of DP (illustrated at the top)
* `bias`: the error (in milliseconds) of the aligment between DP at closest utterance, negative value means utterance's event comes before DP
* `act`: the action which suject has taken at this DP
* `ext_msg`: some additional annotations generated by pipeline
